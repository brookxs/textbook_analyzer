automatic keyword classification many automatic-retrieval systems rely on thesauri to modify queries and document representatives to improve the chance of retrieving relevant documents . salton [40] has experimented with many different kinds of thesauri and concluded that many of the simple ones justify themselves in terms of improved retrieval-effectiveness . in practice many of thesauri are constructed manually . they have mainly been constructed in two ways : (1) words which are deemed to be about the same topic are linked ; (2) words which are deemed to be about related things are linked . the first kind of thesaurus connects words which are intersubstitutible , that is , it puts them into equivalence-classes . then one word could be chosen to represent each class and a list of these words could be used to form a controlled-vocabulary . from this an indexer could be instructed to select the words to index a document , or the user could be instructed to select the words to express his query . the same thesaurus could be used in an automatic way to identify the words of a query for the purpose of retrieval . the second kind of thesaurus uses semantic links between words to , for example , relate them hierarchically . the manually constructed thesaurus used by the medigital libraryars system is of this type . however , methods have been proposed to construct thesauri automatically . whereas , the manual thesauri are semantically based (e.g. they recognise synonyms , more general , or more specific relationships) the automatic thesauri tend to be syntactically and statistically based . again the use of syntax has proved to be of little value , so i shall concentrate on the statistical-methods . these are based mainly on the patterns of co-occurrence of words in documents . these ` words ' are often the descriptive items which were introduced earlier as terms of keywords . the basic relationship underlying the automatic-construction of keyword classes is as follows : if keyword a and b are substitutible for one another in the sense that we are prepared to accept a document containing one in response to a request containing the other , this will be because they have the same meaning or refer to a common subject or topic . one way of finding out whether two keywords are related is by looking at the documents in which they occur . if they tend to co-occur in the same documents , the chances are that they have to do with the same subject and so can be substituted for one another . it is not difficult to see that , based on this principle , a classification of keywords can be automatically constructed , of which the classes are used analogously to those of the manual thesaurus mentioned before . more specifically we can identify two main approaches to the use of keyword classifications : (1) replace each keyword in a document (and query) representative by the name of the class in which it occurs ; (2) replace each keyword by all the keywords occurring in the class to which it belongs . if we think of a simple retrieval-strategy as operating by matching on the descriptors , whether they be keyword names or class-names , then ` expanding ' representatives in either of these ways will have the effect of increasing the number of matches between document and query , and hence tends to improve recall * . the second way will improve precision as well . sparck * recall is defined in the introduction . jones [41] has reported a large number of experiments using automatic keyword classifications and found that in general one obtained a better retrieval-performance with the aid of automatic keyword classification than with the unclassified keywords alone . unfortunately , even here the evidence has not been conclusive . the work by minker et al. [42] has not confirmed the findings of sparck jones , and in fact they have shown that in some cases keyword-classification can be detrimental to retrieval-effectiveness . salton [43] , in a review of the work of minker et al. , has questioned their experimental-design which leaves the question of the effectiveness of keyword-classification still to be resolved by further research . the discussion of keyword classifications has by necessity been rather sketchy . readers wishing to pursue it in greater depth should consult sparck jones 's book [41] on the subject . we shall briefly return to it when we discuss automatic-classification methods in chapter 3 .
