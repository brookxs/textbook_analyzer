13.5.1 web-directories the best and oldest example of a web-directory is yahoo! [839] , which is likely the most used searching tool . other large web-directories include eblast , looksmart , magellan , and newhoo . some of them are hybrids , because they also provide searches in the whole web . most search-engines also provide subject-categories nowadays , including altavista categories , aol netfind , excite channels , hotbot , infoseek , lycos subjects , and webcrawler select , are specific to some areas . for example , there are web-sites focused on business , news , browsing 385 web-directory url web-sites categories eblast www.eblast.com 125 _ looksmart www.looksmart.com 300 24 lycos subjects a2z.lycos.com 50 magellan www.mckinley.com 60 newhoo www . lie who o. com 100 23 netscape www.netscape.com - search.com www.search.com - snap www.snap.com - yahoo! www.yahoo.com 750 table 13.3 urls , web-pages indexed and categories (both in thousands) of some web-directories (beginning of 1998) . arts humanities automotive business c economy computers ; internet education employment entertainment leisure games government health fitness hobbies c interests home investing kids family-life style living local news oddities people philosophy religion politics recreation reference regional science sz technology shopping services social-science society : culture sports travel ; tourism world table 13.4 the first level categories in web-directories . and , in particular , research bibliography . web-directories are also called catalogs , yellow pages , or subject directories . table 13.3 gives the urls of the most important web-directories (not including the search-engines already listed in section 13.4) . directories are hierarchical taxonomies that classify human-knowledge . table 13.4 shows the first level of the taxonomies used by web-directories (the number of first level categories ranges from 12 to 26) . some subcategories are also available in the main page of web-directories , adding around 70 more topics . the largest directory , yahoo! , has close to one million pages classified , followed by looksmart , which has about 24,000 categories in total . yahoo! also offers 386 searching the-web 14 regional or country specialized directories in other languages including chinese , danish , french , german , italian , japanese , korean , norwegian , spanish , and swedish . in most cases , pages have to be submitted to the-web directory , where they are reviewed , and , if accepted , classified in one or more categories of the hierarchy . although the taxonomy can be seen as a tree , there are cross references , so it is really a directed-acyclic-graph . the main advantage of this technique is that if we find what we are looking-for , the answer will be useful in most cases . on the other hand , the main disadvantage is that the classification is not specialized enough and that not all web-pages are classified . the last problem becomes worse every day as the-web grows . the efforts to do automatic-classification , by using clustering or other techniques , are very old . however , up to now , natural-language-processing is not 100 % effective in extracting relevant terms from a document . thus , classification is done manually by a limited number of people . this is a potential problem with users having a different notion of categories than the manmade categorization . web-directories also allow the user to perform a search on the taxonomy descriptors or in the w7eb pages pointed to by the taxonomy . in fact , as the number of classified wreb pages is small , we can even afford to have a copy of all pages . in that case they must be updated frequently , which may pose performance and temporal validity problems . in addition , most web-directories also send the query to a search-engine (through a strategic alliance) and allow the whole wreb to be searched .
