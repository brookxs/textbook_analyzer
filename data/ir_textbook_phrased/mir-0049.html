2.9.2 model based on proximal nodes navarro and baeza-yates [41 , 589 , 590] propose a model which allows the definition of independent hierarchical (non-flat) indexing-structures over the same document-text . each of these indexing-structures is a strict hierarchy composed of chapters , sections , paragraphs , pages , and lines which are called nodes (see figure 2.12) . to each of these nodes is associated a text region . further , two distinct hierarchies might refer to overlapping text regions . given a user-query which refers to distinct hierarchies , the compiled answer is formed by nodes which all come from only one of them . thus , an answer can not be composed of nodes which come from two distinct hierarchies (which allows for faster query-processing at the expense of less expressiveness) . notice , however , that due to the hierarchical-structure , nested text regions (coming from the same hierarchy) are allowed in the answer set . figure 2.12 illustrates a hierarchical-indexing structure composed of four 64 modeling - Ã¯ chapter sections subsections subsubsections figure 2.12 hierarchical-index for structural components and flat index for words . levels (corresponding to a chapter , sections , subsections , and subsubsections of the same document) and an inverted list for the word ` holocaust . ' the entries in this inverted list indicate all the positions in the text of the document in which the word ` holocaust ' occurs . in the hierarchy , each node indicates the position in the text of its associated structural component (chapter , section , subsection , or subsubsection) . the query-language allows the specification of regular-expressions (to search for strings) , the reference to structural components by name (to search for chapters , for instance) , and a combination of these . in this sense , the model can be viewed as a compromise between expressiveness and efficiency . the somewhat limited expressiveness of the query-language allows efficient-query-processing by first searching for the components which match the strings specified in the query and , subsequently , evaluating which of these components satisfy the structural part of the query . consider , for instance , the query [(* section) with (` holocaust ')] which searches for sections , subsections , or subsubsections which contain the word ` holocaust .7 a simple query-processing strategy is to traverse the inverted list for the term ` holocaust1 and , for each entry in the list (which indicates an occurrence of the term ` holocaust ' in the text) , search the hierarchical-index looking for sections , subsections , and subsubsections containing that occurrence of the term . a more sophisticated query-processing strategy is as follows . for the first entry in the list for `` holocaust ,1 search the hierarchical-index as before . this implies traversing down the hierarchy until no more successful matches occur (or the bottom of the hierarchy is reached) . let the last matching structural component be referred to as the innermost matching component . once this first search is concluded , do not start ail over again for the following entry in the models for browsing 65 inverted list . instead , verify whether the innermost matching component also matches the second entry in the list . if it does , we immediately conclude that the larger structural components above it (in the hierarchy) also do . proceed then to the third entry in the list , and so on . notice that the query-processing is accelerated because only the nearby (or proximal) nodes in the list need to be searched at each time . this is the reason for the label proximal nodes . the model based on proximal nodes allows us to formulate queries which are more complex than those which can be formulated in the model based on non-overlapping lists . to speed up query-processing , however , only nearby (proximal) nodes are looked at which imposes restrictions on the answer set retrieved (all nodes must come from the same hierarchy) . more complex-models for structured-retrieval have been proposed in the literature as discussed in [41 , 590] .
