8.1 things that are changing alta-vista was , in 1995 , arguably the first search-engine offered for general use , so alta-vista 's history1 is especially interesting . at that time , alta-vista was developed by digital equipment corporation to primarily demonstrate how powerful its new alpha architecture was , especially its then-novel 64-bit addressing and the consequentially vast data-spaces . indexing all the www 's pages and providing a useful service to many was simply good publicity . since that time digital equipment has been acquired by compaq , and alta-vista has been spun off to cmgl as searching newly authored pages on the www has become increasingly profitable , similar ! doc . altavlsta . com/company info / ajxgt ; ut ^ v/baalq # round . slitml 192 conclusions and future-directions 293 search technologies have been applied to existing , traditionally published corpora to form the next generation of digital-libraries [fox and marchionini , 1998 ; paepcke et al. , 1998] . it is amazing how closely they resemble the vision h. g. wells had of what a `` world encyclopedia5 ' might mean , as early as 1938 [wells , 1938] ! as the-internet reaches a mass audience and these new search engine users begin to foa in earnest , important new data are becoming available about how these real-users (as opposed to most ir experimental subjects ; cf. section 4.3.1) behave . silverstein et al. report on their analysis of approximately one billion (109) queries issued against the alta-vista search-engine during six weeks in august and september 1998 [silverstein et al. , 1999] . another important qualification on this preliminary study is that no attempt was made to discriminate `` real , '' human-generated queries from automatic queries generated by robots . still , several features of this study are significant . first , fully 15 % of the queries were entirely empty ; they contained no keywords ! two-thirds of these empty queries were generated within alta-vista 's `` advanced query '' interface . clearly , good interface-design and user-education remains a fundamental issue for effective search-engine design . second , www searches use very short ? simple queries , averaging only 2.3 keywords/query (not including the zero-length queries in this average) . only 12.6 percent of queries used more than three keywords . of course , the fact that alta-vista 's interface does not easily support longer relevance-feedback queries (cf. section 3.6) keeps these from occurring . most users also avoid query-syntax and issue simple queries : only 20 percent of queries used any of alta-vista 's query-operators (+ , - , and , or , not , near) ; half of these used only one operator . these findings are especially significant because they paint a different picture of the `` typical user '' from what ir has traditionally held . when ir systems were first developed , the target-audience was primarily reference librarians , search intermediates who helped library patrons find what they were seeking from sophisticated systems such as dialog . these librarians were specially educated , in particular in the subtleties of boolean-query operators and other sophisticated techniques for constructing exactly the right `` magic bullet ' * query for a particular corpus . ir-system design and theory therefore generally 294 finding out about assumed that queries were fairly rich , structured expressions . at least at the moment , these assumptions do not seem to hold for most web-searching . but despite the relatively simple form of most queries , the third interesting fact is that web-queries are rarely repeated . even folding case and ignoring word-order , only one third of queries appeared more than once in the billion queries ; only 14 percent occurred more than three we mostly ask times.t these statistics are especially significant in the face of new-services about sex suc] 1 as ask jeeves ,2 which focus on providing especially relevant answers for a restricted set of anticipated queries . finally , silverstein et al. attempted to analyze query sessions . knowing when a query is part of a session is notoriously difficult , especially when some queries are being generated by robots ; this study used a combination of server-set cookies and a five-minute time-window to capture coherent searches by the same user . it appears that 78 percent of query sessions involve only a single query and that an average session involves only two queries ! these data are preliminary , but they provide an interesting contrast to the power-law , zipfian distribution of web surfing behavior reported by huberman et al. [huberman et al , 1998] (cf. section 3.2.5) . the primary extension of the search-engine technology developed so far in this text is the crawling function that must harvest web-pages prior to their indexing . the design of web-crawlers is now one of the most active areas of computer-science-research ; we provide only a few basic references here .
