1.3.3 the-web and digital-libraries if we consider the search-engines on the web today , we conclude that they continue to use indexes which are very similar to those used by librarians a century ago . what has changed then ? three dramatic and fundamental changes have occurred due to the advances in modern computer-technology and the boom of the-web . first , it became a lot cheaper to have access to various sources-of-information . this allows reaching a wider audience than ever possible before . second , the advances in all kinds of digital-communication provided greater access to networks . this implies that the information-source is available even if distantly located and that 8 introduction the access can be done quickly (frequently , in a few seconds) . third , the freedom to post whatever information someone judges useful has greatly contributed to the popularity of the-web . for the first time in history , many people have free access to a large publishing medium . fundamentally , low-cost , greater access , and publishing freedom have allowed people to use the-web (and modern digital-libraries) as a highly interactive medium . such interactivity allows people to exchange messages , photos , documents , software , videos , and to ` chat ' in a convenient and low-cost fashion . further , people can do it at the time of their preference (for instance , you can buy a book late at night) which further improves the convenience of the service . thus , high interactivity is the fundamental and current shift in the communication paradigm . searching the-web is covered in chapter 13 , while digital-libraries are covered in chapter 15 . in the future , three main questions need to be addressed . first , despite the high interactivity , people still find it difficult (if not impossible) to retrieve information relevant to their information-needs . thus , in the dynamic world of the-web and of large digital-libraries , which techniques will allow retrieval of higher quality ? second , with the ever increasing demand for access , quick response is becoming more and more a pressing factor . thus , which techniques will yield faster indexes and smaller query response-times ? third , the quality of the retrieval-task is greatly affected by the user-interaction with the system . thus , how will a better understanding of the user-behavior affect the design and deployment of new information retrieval-strategies ?
