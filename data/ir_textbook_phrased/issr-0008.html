1.3.4 index database-search when an item is determined to be of interest , a user may want to save it for future reference . this is in effect filing it . in an information-system this is accomplished via the index process . in this process the user can logically store an item in a file along with additional index-terms and descriptive text the user wants to associate with the item . it is also possible to have index records that do not reference an item , but contain all the substantive information in the index itself . in this case the user is reading items and extracting the information of interest , never needing to go back to the original item . a good analogy to an index file is the card catalog in a library . another perspective is to consider index-files as structured databases whose records can optionally reference items in the document-database . the index database-search process (see figure 1.4) provides the capability to create indexes and search them . the user may search the index and retrieve the index and/or the document it references - the system also provides the capability to search the index and then search the items referenced by the index records that introduction to information-retrieval-systems 19 satisfied the index portion of the query . this is called a combined file-search . in an ideal system the index record could reference portions of items versus the total item . there are two classes of index-files : public and private index-files . every user can have one or more private index-files leading to a very-large number of files . each private index file references only a small subset of the total number of items in the document-database . public index-files are maintained by professional library-services personnel and typically index every item in the document-database . there is a small number of public index-files . these files have access-lists (i.e. , lists of users and their privileges) that allow anyone to search or retrieve data . private index-files typically have very limited access-lists . to assist the users in generating indexes , especially the professional indexers , the system provides a process called automatic file build shown in figure 1.4 (also called information-extraction) . this capability processes selected incoming documents and automatically determine potential indexing for the item . the rules that govern which documents are processed for extraction of index information and the index term extraction-process are stored in automatic file build profiles . when an item is processed it results in creation of candidate index records . as a minimum , certain citation data can be determined and extracted as part of this process assisting in creation of public index-files . examples of this information are author (s) , date of publication , source , and references . more complex-data , such as countries an item is about or corporations referenced , have high rates of identification . the placement in an index file facilitates normalizing the terminology , assisting the user in finding items . it also provides a basis for-programs that analyze the contents of systems trying to identify new information relationships (i.e. , data-mining) . for more abstract-concepts the extraction-technology is not accurate and comprehensive enough to allow the created index records to automatically update the index-files . instead the candidate index record , along with the item it references , are stored in a file for review and edit by a user prior to actual update of an index file . the capability to create private and public index-files is frequently implemented via a structured database management-system . this has introduced new challenges in developing the theory and algorithms that allow a single integrated perspective on the information in the system . for example , how to use the single instance information in index fields and free-text to provide a single system value of how the index/referenced item combination satisfies the user 's search statement . usually the issue is avoided by treating the aspects of the search that apply to the structured records as a first level constraint identifying a set of items that satisfy that portion of the query . the resultant items are then searched using the rest of the query and the functions associated with information-systems . the evaluation of relevance is based only on this later step . an example of how this limits the user is if part of the index is a field called `` country . '' this certainly allows the user to constrain his results to only those countries of interest (e.g. , peru or mexico) . but because the relevance function is only associated with the portion 20 chapter 1 of the query associated with the item , there is no way for the user to ensure that peru items have more importance to the retrieval than mexican items .
