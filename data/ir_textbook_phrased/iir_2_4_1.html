biword indexes one approach to handling phrases is to consider every pair of consecutive terms in a document as a phrase . for example , the text friends , romans , countrymen would generate the biwords : friends romans romans countrymen `` stanford-university '' and `` university palo '' and `` palo alto '' among possible queries , nouns and noun-phrases have a special status in describing the concepts people are interested in searching for . but related nouns can often be divided from each other by various function-words , in phrases such as the abolition of slavery or renegotiation of the constitution . these needs can be incorporated into the biword indexing-model in the following way . first , we tokenize the text and perform part-of-speech-tagging . we can then group terms into nouns , including proper nouns , (n) and function-words , including articles and prepositions , (x) , among other classes . now deem any string of terms of the form nx * n to be an extended biword . each such extended biword is made a term in the vocabulary . for example : renegotiation of the constitution n x x n this algorithm does not always work in an intuitively optimal manner when parsing longer queries into boolean-queries . using the above algorithm , the query cost overruns on a power plant `` cost overruns '' and `` overruns power '' and `` power plant '' the concept of a biword index can be extended to longer sequences of words , and if the index includes variable-length word-sequences , it is generally referred to as a phrase-index . indeed , searches for a single term are not naturally handled in a biword index (you would need to scan the dictionary for all biwords containing the term) , and so we also need to have an index of single-word terms . while there is always a chance of false-positive matches , the chance of a false-positive match on indexed phrases of length 3 or more becomes very small indeed . but on the other hand , storing longer phrases has the potential to greatly expand the vocabulary-size . maintaining exhaustive phrase indexes for phrases of length greater than two is a daunting prospect , and even use of an exhaustive biword dictionary greatly expands the size of the vocabulary . however , towards the end of this section we discuss the utility of the strategy of using a partial phrase-index in a compound indexing-scheme .
