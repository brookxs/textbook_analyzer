5.3.2 query-expansion through local-context-analysis the local-clustering techniques discussed above are based on the set of documents retrieved for the original query and use the top ranked documents for clustering neighbor terms (or stems) . such a clustering is based on term (stems were considered above) co-occurrence inside documents . terms which are the best neighbors of each query-term are then used to expand the original query q . a distinct approach is to search for term correlations in the whole collection ó an approach called global-analysis . global techniques usually involve the building of a thesaurus which identifies term-relationships in the whole collection . the terms are treated as concepts and the thesaurus is viewed as a concept-relationship structure . thesauri are expensive to build but , besides providing support for query-expansion , are useful as a browsing tool as demonstrated by some search-engines in the web . the building of a thesaurus usually considers the use of small contexts and phrase structures instead of simply adopting the context provided by a whole document . furthermore , with modern variants of global-analysis , terms which are closest to the whole query (and not to individual query terms) are selected for query-expansion . the application of ideas from global-analysis (such as small contexts and phrase structures) to the local set of documents retrieved is a recent idea which we now discuss . local-context-analysis [838] combines global and local analysis and works as follows . first , the approach is based on the use of noun-groups (i.e. , a single noun , two adjacent nouns , or three adjacent nouns in the text) , instead of simple keywords , as document concepts . for query-expansion , concepts are selected froiri the top ranked documents (as in local analysis) based on their co-occurrence with query terms (no stemming) . however , instead of documents , passages (i.e. , a text window of fixed size) are used for determining co-occurrence (as in global-analysis) . more specifically , the local-context-analysis procedure operates in three steps . ï first , retrieve the top n ranked passages using the original query . this is accomplished by breaking up the documents initially retrieved by the 130 query-operations query in fixed length passages (for instance , of size 300 words) and ranking these passages as if they were documents . ï second , for each concept c in the top ranked passages , the similarity sirn (q) c) between the whole query q (not individual query terms) and the concept c is computed using a variant of tf-idf ranking . ï third , the top m ranked concepts (according to sim (q , c)) are added to the original query q. to each added concept is assigned a weight given by 1 ó 0.9 x i/m where i is the position of the concept in the final concept ranking . the terms in the original query q might be stressed by assigning a weight equal to 2 to each of them . of these three steps , the second one is the most complex and the one which we now discuss . the similarity sim (q , c) between each related concept c and the original query q is computed as follows . where n is the number of top ranked passages considered . the function / (c , ki) quantifies the correlation between the concept c and the query-term fcj and is given by where pfij is the frequency of term k2 in the j-th passage and pfcij is the frequency of the concept c in the j-th passage . notice that this is the standard correlation-measure defined for association clusters (by equation 5.5) but adapted for passages . the inverse-document-frequency factors are computed as idjx = mar (l , ó where ar is the number of passages in the collection , npt is the number of passages containing the term kv and npc is the number of passages containing the concept c . the factor 5 is a constant parameter which avoids a value equal to zero for sirn (q , c) (which is useful , for instance , if the approach is to be used with probabilistic frameworks such as that provided by belief-networks) . usually , 8 is a small factor with values close to 0.1 (10 % of the maximum of 1) . finally , the idft factor in the exponent is introduced to emphasize infrequent query terms . the procedure above for computing sirniq.c) is a non-trivial variant of tf-idf ranking . furthermore , it lias been adjusted for operation with trec-data automatic global-analysis 131 and did not work so well with a different collection . thus , it is important to have in mind that tuning might be required for operation with a different collection . we also notice that the correlation-measure adopted with local-context-analysis is of type association . however , we already know that a correlation of type metric is expected to be more effective . thus , it remains to be tested whether the adoption of a metric correlation factor (for the function / (c , fe ^)) makes any difference with local-context-analysis .
