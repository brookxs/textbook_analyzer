advertising as the economic-model branding cost per mil cpm impressions clicked on cost per click cpc the pioneer in this direction was a company named goto , which changed its name to overture prior to eventual acquisition by yahoo! goto was not , in the traditional sense , a search-engine ; rather , for every query-term it accepted bids from companies who wanted their web-page shown on the query . in response to the query , goto would return the pages of all advertisers who bid for , ordered by their bids . furthermore , when the user clicked on one of the returned results , the corresponding advertiser would make a payment to goto (in the initial implementation , this payment equaled the advertiser 's bid for) . several aspects of goto 's model are worth highlighting . first , a user typing the query into goto 's search-interface was actively expressing an interest and intent related to the query . for instance , a user typing golf clubs is more likely to be imminently purchasing a set than one who is simply browsing news on golf . second , goto only got compensated when a user actually expressed interest in an advertisement - as evinced by the user clicking the advertisement . taken together , these created a powerful mechanism by which to connect advertisers to consumers , quickly raising the annual revenues of goto/overture into hundreds of millions of dollars . this style of search-engine came to be known variously as sponsored-search or search-advertising . given these two kinds of search-engines - the `` pure '' search-engines such as google and altavista , versus the sponsored-search engines - the logical next step was to combine them into a single user experience . current search-engines follow precisely this model : they provide pure search-results (generally known as algorithmic search-results) as the primary response to a user 's search , together with sponsored-search results displayed separately and distinctively to the right of the algorithmic results . this is shown in figure 19.6 . retrieving sponsored-search results and ranking them in response to a query has now become considerably more sophisticated than the simple goto scheme ; the process entails a blending of ideas from information-retrieval and microeconomics , and is beyond the scope of this book . for advertisers , understanding how search-engines do this ranking and how to allocate marketing campaign budgets to different keywords and to different sponsored-search engines has become a profession known as search-engine-marketing (sem) . search-advertising triggered by query keywords.here the query a320 returns algorithmic search-results about the airbus aircraft , together with advertisements for various non-aircraft goods numbered a320 , that advertisers seek to market to those querying on this query . the lack of advertisements for the aircraft reflects the fact that few marketers attempt to sell a320 aircraft on the web . the inherently economic motives underlying sponsored-search give rise to attempts by some participants to subvert the system to their advantage . this can take many forms , one of which is known as click spam . there is currently no universally accepted definition of click spam . it refers (as the name suggests) to clicks on sponsored-search results that are not from bona fide search users . for instance , a devious advertiser may attempt to exhaust the advertising budget of a competitor by clicking repeatedly (through the use of a robotic click generator) on that competitor 's sponsored-search advertisements . search-engines face the challenge of discerning which of the clicks they observe are part of a pattern of click spam , to avoid charging their advertiser clients for such clicks . exercises . the goto method ranked advertisements matching a query by bid : the highest-bidding advertiser got the top position , the second-highest the next , and so on . what can go wrong with this when the highest-bidding advertiser places an advertisement that is irrelevant to the query ? why might an advertiser with an irrelevant advertisement bid high in this manner ? suppose that , in addition to bids , we had for each advertiser their click-through-rate : the ratio of the historical number of times users click on their advertisement to the number of times the advertisement was shown . suggest a modification of the goto scheme that exploits this data to avoid the problem in exercise 19.3 above .
