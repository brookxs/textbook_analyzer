10.3 the information-access process a person engaged in an information-seeking process has one or more goals in mind and uses a search-system as a tool to help achieve those goals . goals requiring information-access can range quite widely , from finding a plumber to keeping informed about a business competitor , from writing a publishable scholarly article to investigating an allegation of fraud . information-access tasks are used to achieve these goals . these tasks span the spectrum from asking specific questions to exhaustively researching a topic . other tasks fall between these two extremes . a study of business analysts [614] found three main kinds of information-seeking-tasks : monitoring a well known topic over time (such as researching competitors ' activities each quarter) , following a plan or stereotyped series of searches to achieve a particular goal (such as keeping up to date on good business practices) , and exploring a topic in an undirected fashion (m when getting to know an unfamiliar industry) . although the goals differ , there is a common core revolving around the information-seeking component , which is our focus here .
