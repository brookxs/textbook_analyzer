2.8.5 computational costs of bayesian-networks in the inference-network model , according to equation 2.6 , only the states which have a single-document active node are considered . thus , the cost of computing the ranking is linear on the number of documents in the collection . as with conventional collections , index-structures such as inverted-files (see chapter 8) are used to restrict the ranking computation to those documents which have terms in common with the query . thus , the cost of computing an inference-network ranking has the same complexity as the cost of computing a vectorial ranking . in the belief network-model , according to equation 2.13 , the only states (of the roots nodes) considered (for computing the rank of a document d3) are the ones in which the active nodes are exactly those associated with the query terms . thus , again , the cost of computing the ranking is linear on the number of documents in the collection . if index-structures are used , the cost of computing a belief network ranking has the same complexity as the cost of computing a vectorial ranking . structured-text retrieval-models 61 therefore , the bayesian-network models discussed here do not impose significant additional costs for ranking computation . this is so because the networks presented do not include cycles , which implies that belief-propagation can be done in a time proportional to the number of nodes in the network .
