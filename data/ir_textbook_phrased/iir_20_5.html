(2002) shkapenyuk and suel (2002) our discussion of dns resolution (section 20.2.2) uses the current convention for internet addresses , known as ipv4 (for internet-protocol version 4) - each ip-address is a sequence of four bytes . in the future , the convention for addresses (collectively known as the-internet address-space) is likely to use a new standard known as ipv6 (http://www.ipv6.org/) . tomasic and garcia-molina (1993) and jeong and omiecinski (1995) are key early papers evaluating term partitioning versus document-partitioning for distributed indexes . document-partitioning is found to be superior , at least when the distribution of terms is skewed , as it typically is in practice . this result has generally been confirmed in more recent work (macfarlane et al. , 2000) . but the outcome depends on the details of the distributed-system ; at least one thread of work has reached the opposite conclusion (ribeiro-neto and barbosa , 1998 , badue et al. , 2001) . sornil (2001) argues for a partitioning scheme that is a hybrid between term and document-partitioning . barroso et al. (2003) describe the distribution methods used at google . the first implementation of a connectivity server was described by bharat et al. (1998) . the scheme discussed in this chapter , currently believed to be the best published scheme (achieving as few as 3 bits per link for encoding) , is described in a series of papers by boldi and vigna (2004b ; a) .
