1.6 foa versus database-retrieval within the field of computer-science , the sub fields of databases and ir are often closely aligned . databases have well-developed theoretic underpinnings [abiteboul et al. , 1995] that have generated efficient-algorithms [mcfadden and hoffer , 1994] and become the foundation for one of the most successful elements of the computer industry . both databases and search-engines attempt to characterize a particular class of queries by which many users are expected to attempt to get information from computers . historically , database-systems and theory have been perceived as central to the discipline of computer-science , probably more so than the ir techniques that are the core-technologies for foa . things may be changing , however . the general public 's discovery of the-internet and subsequent interest in search-engines like alta-vista , infoseek , and yahoo! suggest that many users find value in the lists of web-pages returned in response to searches . these search-engines are clearly doing an important job for many people . it is also a quantitatively different job from organizing their address book (or record collection or baseball statistics) databases . how are ir and database-technologies to be distinguished ? to make the distinctions more concrete , let 's imagine a particular information-need and think about how both a database and a search-engine might attempt to satisfy it . an example query might be as follows . query 3 what is the best scsi disk-drive to buy ? 30 finding out about table 1.1 hypothetical database-size price speed model number manufacturer vendor (gb) interface ($) (msec) 123 seag jr 2.4 scsi 162 12 123 seag fry 2.4 scsi 159 12 456 metrop ab 2.5 ide 0 12.5 789 seag jr 1.5 eide 121 10.5 in the case of databases , strong assumptions must first be made about structure among attributes of individual records . good database-design demands that the fundamental elements of data , their format , and logical-relations among them be carefully analyzed and anticipated in a logical-data-model long before any data are actually collected and maintained within a physical implementation . these assumptions allow specification of a syntax for the query-language , strategies for optimizing the query 's use of computational-resources , and efficient-storage of the data on physical-devices . now let 's assume that a logical-data-model has been constructed and that a large catalog of information from various hard drive manufacturers and vendors has been collated . we will also make the larger and problematic assumption that the users can translate the natural-language of query 3 into the somewhat baroque syntax of a query-language such as sql . the result of the database-search might look something like nlpfor table 1.1.1 '' databases creating an example relation like this and populating it with a few instances is simple , but performing the necessary data-modeling , collating the data from all of the manufacturers and vendors , and keeping it all up to date are much more daunting tasks . if the database catalog is out of date or missing-data from important vendors , users might leave the database badly informed . now let 's imagine using a search-engine on the same query . when run against a usenet-news search-engine like dejanews , this query results in the retrieval shown in figure 1.8 with the most highly ranked posting shown in figure 1.9 . users of this search-engine will read about many issues related to hard disks , some of which may be relevant to their particular situation . overview 31 matches 1-20 of 726 for search : best scsi disfc date scr subject re : ide or scsi ?

(you 'll `` hear1 ' a lot of people arguing that ide is good enough , but if you are after overall improved performance scsi is best .) my 2y . figure 1.9 a relevant posting for example , does the `` best '' qualifier in query 3 mean lowest cost , maximum capacity , minimum access-time , or something else ? can users choose between ide and scsi , or are they restricted to scsi ? depending on what kind of users they are , some of the information retrieved may be 32 finding out about table 1.2 ir versus database-retrieval ir database-system provides pointer to data data item user 's query general specific retrieval-method probabilistic deterministic success criteria utility (correctness) efficiency , user-friendliness , ... immediately applicable to the purchase being considered , while other parts of it are better considered collateral knowledge (d. e. rose , personal-communication) that simply leaves users better informed . a very different set of assumptions from those we made about the database-system are necessary to imagine the search-engine working . for example , who wrote these postings ? are they a credible source of good information ; what is their authority ? well-trained database users should ask equally skeptical questions about the data retrieved , but rarely are authority , data-integrity , and the like considered part of database-analysis . but the key assumption for our ir users is that they can `` listen in '' on this previous `` conversation '' and interpret the text that has been left behind as containing potential answers to the current question . the search-engine is charged with retrieving textual passages that are likely to answer the users ' questions . once presented with these retrievals , foa users have more humble expectations and are willing to do more interpretive work . because foa searches are often even less concrete than query 3 and are issued by users simply trying to learn about a topic , semantic issues central to the interpretation of a textual passage and its context , validity , and so on are at the heart of the foa enterprise . van rijsbergen , p. 2 , table 1.1 has summarized these issues along a number of dimensions by which ir and database-systems can be distinguished , and several of these are duplicated in table 1.2 . database-systems are almost always assumed to provide data items directly . search-engines provide a level of indirection , a pointer to textual passages that contain many facts , hopefully including some of interest . the information-need of the users is quite vague when compared to that of database overview 33 users . the search-engine users are searching for information about a topic they do n't completely understand . typical database users have a fairly specific question , like query 3 , in mind . it might even be that the database is missing some data ; for example , the special null-value 0 in table 1.1 shows that the price of the third disk-drive is not known . even in this case , however , the database-system `` knows that it does n't know '' this information . foa queries are rarely brought to such a sharp point ; ambiguity is intrinsic to the users5 expectations . because the queries are so general , an foa retrieval must be described in probabilistic terms . if a particular hard-disk 's price is part of our database , we are certain , with probability = 1.0 , of its value . never would a database-system reply with `` this hard-disk might cost about $ 300 . '' as discussed in depth in section 5.5 , a search-engine can use sophisticated methods for reasoning probabilistically , and available evidence might even allow it to be quite confident that retrieved items will be perceived as relevant . but never will we be entirely certain that a document is what users want ; we can only have high confidence that it may be . finally , one of the problems in evaluating search-engines is just what success criteria are to be used . we typically assume that information we get back from a database-system is correct . (try to find an ad for a database-system that boasts , `` our system retrieves only right answers '' !) one database-system claims to be more efficient , cheaper , easier to integrate into existing code , and more user-friendly than others . this list of ways that search-engines might be distinguished from databases is far from exhaustive ; blair has proposed a more extensive analysis [blair , 1984] . more recently , as search-engine technology and www-inspired applications have both burgeoned , hybrids of databases and search-engines have blurred the historical differences further . some bases of database/search engine interaction are mentioned in chapter 6 . chapter 4 discusses the evaluation of search-engines in great detail , but typically the bottom line is : does the system help you ? if you are writing a research-paper , did this search-engine help you find material that was useful in your research ? if you are a lawyer preparing a case and you want to find every relevant judicial opinion , does the search-engine offer an advantage over an equivalent amount of time combing 34 finding out about through books in a law library ? such squishy , qualitative judgments are notoriously difficult to measure , and especially to measure consistently across broad populations of users . the next section provides a quick preview of several precise measurements that have proven useful to the ir community but would not be found persuasive within the database community .
