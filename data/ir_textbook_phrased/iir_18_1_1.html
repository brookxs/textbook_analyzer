matrix-decompositions factored matrix-decomposition 18.3 18.2 we begin by giving two theorems on the decomposition of a square matrix into the product of three matrices of a special form . the first of these , theorem 18.1.1 , gives the basic factorization of a square real-valued matrix into three factors . the second , theorem 18.1.1 , applies to square symmetric matrices and is the basis of the singular-value-decomposition described in theorem 18.2 . theorem . (matrix diagonalization theorem) let be a square real-valued matrix with linearly independent eigenvectors . then there exists an eigen-decomposition (223) (224) end theorem . to understand how theorem 18.1.1 works , we note that has the eigenvectors of as columns (225) (226) (227) (228) we next state a closely related decomposition of a symmetric square matrix into the product of matrices derived from its eigenvectors . this will pave the way for the development of our main tool for text-analysis , the singular-value-decomposition (section 18.2) . theorem . (symmetric diagonalization theorem) let be a square , symmetric real-valued matrix with linearly independent eigenvectors . then there exists a symmetric diagonal decomposition (229) end theorem . we will build on this symmetric diagonal decomposition to build low-rank approximations to term-document matrices . exercises . what is the rank of the diagonal matrix below ? (230) show that is an eigenvalue of (231) find the corresponding eigenvector . compute the unique eigen-decomposition of the-matrix in (222) .
