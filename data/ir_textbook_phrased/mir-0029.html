2.5.2 boolean-model the boolean-model is a simple retrieval-model based on set-theory and boolean-algebra . since the concept of a set is quite intuitive , the boolean-model provides a framework which is easy to grasp by a common user of an ir-system . furthermore , the queries are specified as boolean-expressions which have precise-semantics . given its inherent simplicity and neat formalism , the boolean-model received great attention in past years and was adopted by many of the early commercial bibliographic systems . 26 modeling k figure 2.3 the three conjunctive components for the query [q = ka a (fc v - gt ; kc)] . unfortunately , the boolean-model suffers from major drawbacks . first , its retrieval-strategy is based on a binary-decision criterion (i.e. , a document is predicted to be either relevant or non-relevant) without any notion of a grading scale , which prevents good retrieval-performance . thus , the boolean-model is in reality much more a data (instead of information) retrieval-model . second , while boolean-expressions have precise-semantics , frequently it is not simple to translate an information-need into a boolean-expression . in fact , most users find it difficult and awkward to express their query requests in terms of boolean-expressions . the boolean-expressions actually formulated by users often are quite simple (see chapter 10 for a more thorough discussion on this issue) . despite these drawbacks , the boolean-model is still the dominant model with commercial document-database systems and provides a good starting point for those new to the field . the boolean-model considers that index-terms are present or absent in a document . as a result , the index term weights are assumed to be all binary , i.e. , wij g {0,1} . a query q is composed of index-terms linked by three connectives : not , and , or.thus , a query is essentially a conventional boolean-expression which can be represented as a disjunction of conjunctive vectors (i.e. , in disjunctive-normal-form รณ dnf) . for instance , the query [q = ka a (fc v ^ kc)] can be written in disjunctive-normal-form as [qdnf รณ (1 ? 1gt ; 1) v (1 ? 1 ? 0) v (1,0,0)] , where each of the components is a binary weighted vector associated with the tuple (ka , fc , kc) . these binary weighted vectors are called the conjunctive components of qdnf-figure 2.3 illustrates the three conjunctive components for the query q. definition for the boolean-model , the index term weight variables are all binary i.e. , u ^ j # {0,1} . a query q is a conventional boolean-expression . let qdnf be the disjunctive-normal-form for the query q. further , let qcc be any of the conjunctive components of qdnf - the similarity of a document dj to the query q is defined as simid a) = {j \ 0 otherwise classic information-retrieval 27 if sim (dj1q) = 1 then the boolean-model predicts that the document dj is relevant to the query q (it might not be) . otherwise , the prediction is that the document is not relevant . the boolean-model predicts that each document is either relevant or non-relevant there is no notion of a partial-match to the query conditions . for instance , let dj be a document for which dj = (0,1,0) . document dj includes the index term fc but is considered non-relevant to the query [q = feo a (fc v-ifec)] . the main advantages of the boolean-model are the clean formalism behind the model and its simplicity . the main disadvantages are that exact-matching may lead to retrieval of too few or too many documents (see chapter 10) . today , it is well known that index-term-weighting can lead to a substantial improvement in retrieval-performance . index-term-weighting brings us to the vector-model .
