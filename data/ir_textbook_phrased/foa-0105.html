5.5.3 odds calculation in addition to evidence the features provide to show that a document is rational world rel , pr (rel | x) , they may also provide evidence that it is not : pr (rel | x) j an odds calculation balances both probabilities as a ratio : (5.38) pr (rel \ x) the bayes rule can also be applied to this ratio : pr (rel \ x) pr (rel) pr (x \ rel) pr (rel \ x) pr (rel) pr (x \ rel) pr (ic \ rpl) (5.39) odds (rel | x) = pr (x \ rel) the first term will be small ; the odds of picking a relevant versus irrelevant document independent of any features of the document are not good . still , odds (rel) can be expected to be a characteristic of an entire corpus or the generality of the current query but insensitive to any analysis we might perform on a particular document . in order to calculate the second term , we need a more refined model of how documents are `` constructed '' from their features .
