appendix porter 's algorithm the rules in the porter algorithm are separated into five distinct phases numbered from 1 to 5 . they are applied to the words in the text starting from phase 1 and moving on to phase 5 . further , they are applied sequentially one after the other as commands in a program . thus , in what follows , we specify the porter algorithm in a pseudo programming-language whose commands take the form of rules for suffix substitution (as above) . this pseudo language adopts the following (semi-formal) conventions : ï a consonant variable is represented by the symbol c which is used to refer to any letter other than a , e , i , o , u and other than the letter y preceded by a consonant . ï a vowel variable is represented by the symbol v which is used to refer to any letter which is not a consonant . ï a generic letter (consonant or vowel) is represented by the symbol l. ï the symbol lt ; jgt ; is used to refer to an empty-string (i.e. , one with no letters) . ï combinations of c , v '' , and l are used to define patterns . ï the symbol * is used to refer to zero or more repetitions of a given pattern . ï the symbol - f is used to refer to one or more repetitions of a given pattern . ï matched parentheses are used to subordinate a sequence of variables to the operators * and - f. ï a generic pattern is a combination of symbols , matched parentheses , and the operators * and ~ f. 433 434 porter 's algorithm ï the substitution rules are treated as commands which are separated by a semicolon punctuation-mark . ï the substitution rules are applied to the suffixes in the current word . ï a conditional if statement is expressed as ` if (pattern) rule ' and the rule is executed only if the pattern in the condition matches the current word . ï a line which starts with a % is treated as a comment . ï curly brackets (braces) are used to form compound commands . ï a ` select rule with longest suffix ' statement selects a single rule for execution among all the rules in a compound command . the rule selected is the one with the largest matching suffix . thus , the expression (c) * refers to a sequence of zero or more consonants while the expression ((v) * (c) *) * refers to a sequence of zero or more vowels followed by zero or more consonants which can appear zero or more times . it is important to distinguish the above from the sequence (v * c) which states that a sequence must be present and that this sequence necessarily starts with a vowel , followed by a subsequence of zero or more letters , and finished by a consonant . finally , the command if (* y * l) then ed ógt ; lt ; / gt ; states that the substitution of the suffix ed by nil (i.e. , the removal of the suffix ed) only occurs if the current word contains a vowel and at least one additional letter . the porter algorithm is applied to each word in the text (simple formulation) and is given by the following procedure . % phase 1 : plurals and past participles . select rule with longest suffix {sses ógt ; ss ; ies ó ? i ; ss ó * ss ; s ógt ; lt ; / gt ; ;} select rule with longest suffix {if ((cn (v) + (c) +) + (vteed) then eed ógt ; ee ; if (* v * ed or * v * ing) then {porter 's algorithm 435 select rule with longest suffix {ed ógt ; ing ógt ; 0 ;} select rule with longest suffix {at ógt ; ate ; bl ó ? ble ; iz ógt ; ize ; if ((* cic2) and (ci = c2) and (ci 0 {l , s , z})) then cxc2 ógt ; ci ; if {({cy {{v) + (c) +) clv1c2) and (c2 # {w , x , y})) then e ;} if (* v * y) then y ógt ; i ; if ((c) * ((i /) + (c) +) + (i /) * select rule with longest suffix {ational ó ? ate ; tional ógt ; tion ; enci ógt ; ence ; anci ó ? ance ; izer ógt ; ize ; abli ó ^ able ; alii ógt ; al ; entli ógt ; ent ; eli ó ? e ; ousli ógt ; ï ous ; ization ógt ; ize ; ation ó ? ate ; at or ógt ; ate ; alism ó ? al ; iveness ó ? ive ; fulness óy fill : ousness ó - * - ous ; aiiti ógt ; - al ; iviti ógt ; ive ; biliti ó ? ble ;} select rule with longest suffix {icate ó * ic ; at ive - ó ? dgt ; ; 436 porter 's algorithm alize ó ? al ; iciti ógt ; ic ; ical ó ? ic ; ful ó * 4gt ; ness ó ? cp ;} if ((c) * ((v) + (c) +) ((v) + (c) +) + (v) *) then select rule with longest suffix {al ógt ; 0 ; ance ó ? 0 ; ence ógt ; 0 ; er ógt ; 0 ; ic ógt ; 4gt ; ; able ój - cp ; ible ógt ; ¶ 0 ; ant ó ?
