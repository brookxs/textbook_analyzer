phonetic correction phonetic algorithms for such phonetic hashing are commonly collectively known as soundex algorithms . however , there is an original soundex-algorithm , with various variants , built on the following scheme : turn every term to be indexed into a 4-character reduced form . build an inverted-index from these reduced forms to the original terms ; call this the soundex index . do the same with query terms . when the query calls for a soundex match , search this soundex index . retain the first letter of the term . change all occurrences of the following letters to ' 0 ' (zero) : ` a ' , e ' , ` i ' , ` o ' , ` u ' , ` h ' , ` w ' , ` y ' . change letters to digits as follows : b , f , p , v to 1 . c , g , j , k , q , s , x , z to 2 . d , t to 3 . l to 4 . m , n to 5 . r to 6 . repeatedly remove one out of each pair of consecutive identical digits . remove all zeros from the resulting string . pad the resulting string with trailing zeros and return the first four positions , which will consist of a letter followed by three digits . for an example of a soundex map , hermann maps to h655 . given a query (say herman) , we compute its soundex code and then retrieve all vocabulary terms matching this soundex code from the soundex index , before running the resulting query on the standard inverted-index . this algorithm rests on a few observations : (1) vowels are viewed as interchangeable , in transcribing names ; (2) consonants with similar sounds (e.g. , d and t) are put in equivalence-classes . this leads to related names often having the same soundex codes . while these rules work for many cases , especially european languages , such rules tend to be writing-system dependent . for example , chinese names can be written in wade-giles or pinyin transcription . while soundex works for some of the differences in the two transcriptions , for instance-mapping both wade-giles hs and pinyin x to 2 , it fails in other cases , for example wade-giles j and pinyin r are mapped differently . exercises . find two differently spelled proper nouns whose soundex codes are the same . find two phonetically similar proper nouns whose soundex codes are different .
