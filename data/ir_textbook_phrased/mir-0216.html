10.8.5 retaining search-history section 10.3 discusses information-seeking strategies and behaviors that have been observed by researchers in the field . this discussion suggests that the user-interface should show what the available choices are at any given point , as well as what moves have been made in the past , short-terrn tactics as well as longer-term strategies , and allow the user to annotate the choices made and information found along the way . users should be able to bundle-search sessions as well as save individual portions of a given search-session , and flexibly access and modify each . there is also increasing interest in incorporating personal-preference and usage information both into formulation of queries and use of the results of search [277] . for the most part these strategies are not supported well in current user-interfaces ; however some mechanisms have been introduced that begin to address these needs . in particular , mechanisms to retain prior history of the search are useful for these tasks . some kind of history mechanism has been made available in most search systems in the past . usually these consist of a list of the commands executed earlier . more recently , graphical-history has been introduced , that allows tracking of commands and results as well . kim and hirtle 318 user-interfaces and visualization figure 10.31 the visage interaction-history visualization [685] . [440] present a summary of graphical-history presentation mechanisms . recently , a graphical-interface that displays web-page access-history in a hierarchical-structure was found to require fewer page accesses and require less time when returning to pages already visited [370] . an innovation of particular interest for information-access interfaces is exemplified by the saving of state in miniature form in a ` slide sorter ' view as exercised by the visage system for information-visualization [685] (see figure 10.31) . the visage application has the added advantage of being visual in nature and so individual states are easier to recognize . although intended to be used as a presentation creation facility , this interface should also be useful for retaining search action history .
