1.4 relationship to database-management-systems there are two major categories of systems available to process items : information-retrieval-systems and data-base-management-systems (dbms) . confusion can arise when the software-systems supporting each of these applications get confiised with the data they are manipulating . an information-retrieval-system is software that has the features and functions required to manipulate `` information '' items versus a dbms that is optimized to handle `` structured '' data . information is fuzzy text . the term `` fuzzy * '' ' is used to imply the results from the minimal standards or controls on the creators of the text items . the author is trying to present concepts , ideas and abstractions along with supporting facts . as such , there is minimal consistency in the vocabulary and styles of items discussing the exact same issue . the searcher has to be omniscient to specify all search-term possibilities in the query . introduction to information-retrieval-systems 21 structured-data is well defined data (facts) typically represented by tables . there is a semantic-description associated with each attribute within a table that well defines that attribute . for example , there is no confusion between the meaning of `` employee name '' or `` employee salary '' and what values to enter in a specific database-record . on the other hand , if two different people generate an abstract for the same item , they can be different . one abstract may generally discuss the most important topic in an item . another abstract , using a different vocabulary , may specify the details of many topics . it is this diversity and ambiguity of language that causes the fuzzy nature to be associated with information items . the differences in the characteristics of the data is one reason for the major differences in functions required for the two classes of systems . with structured-data a user enters a specific request and the results returned provide the user with the desired information . the results are frequently tabulated and presented in a report format for ease-of-use . in contrast , a search of `` information '' items has a high probability of not finding all the items a user is looking for . the user has to refine his search to locate additional items of interest . this process is called `` iterative-search . '' an information-retrieval-system gives the user capabilities to assist the user in finding the relevant items , such as relevance-feedback (see chapters 2 and 7) . the results from an information-system search are presented in relevance ranked order . the confusion comes when dbms software is used to store `` information . '' this is easy to implement , but the system lacks the ranking and relevance-feedback features that are critical to an information-system . it is also possible to have structured-data used in an information-system (such as topic) . when this happens the user has to be very creative to get the system to provide the reports and management-information that are trivially available in a dbms . from a practical standpoint , the integration of dbms 's and information retrieval-systems is very important . commercial database companies have already integrated the two types of systems . one of the first commercial databases to integrate the two systems into a single view is the inquire dbms . this has been available for over fifteen years . a more current example is the oracle dbms that now offers an imbedded capability called convectis , which is an informational-retrieval system that uses a comprehensive thesaurus which provides the basis to generate `` themes '' for a particular item . convectis also provides standard statistical-techniques that are described in chapter 5 . the informix dbms has the ability to link to retrievalware to provide integration of structured-data and information along with functions associated with information-retrieval-systems .
