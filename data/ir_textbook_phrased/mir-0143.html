8.5 sequential-searching we now cover the algorithms for text-searching when no data-structure has been built on the text . as shown , this is a basic part of some indexing-techniques as well as the only option in some cases . we cover exact string-matching in this section . later we cover matching of more complex patterns . our exposition is mainly conceptual and the implementation details are not shown (see the bibliographic discussion at the end of this chapter for more information) . the problem of exact string-matching is : given a short pattern p of length m and a long text t of length n , find all the text positions where the pattern occurs . with minimal changes this problem subsumes many basic queries , such as word , prefix , suffix , and substring-search . this is a classical problem for which a wealth of solutions exists . we sketch the main algorithms , and leave aside a lot of the theoretical work that is not competitive in practice . for example , we do not include the karp-rabin algorithm , which is a nice application of hashing to string-searching , but is not practical . we also briefly cover multipattern algorithms (that search many patterns at once) , since a query may have many patterns and it may be more efficient to retrieve them all at once . finally , we also mention how to do phrases and proximity searches . we assume that the text and the pattern are sequences of characters drawn from an alphabet of size lt ; r , whose first character is at position 1 . the average-case-analysis assumes random text and patterns .
