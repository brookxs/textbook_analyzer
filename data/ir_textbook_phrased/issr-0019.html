2.1.5 term masking term masking is the ability to expand a query-term by masking a portion of the term and accepting as valid any processing token that maps to the unmasked portion of the term . the value of term masking is much higher in systems that do not perform stemming or only provide a very simple stemming algorithm . there are two types of search-term masking : fixed length and variable-length . sometimes they are called fixed and variable-length `` do n't care '' functions . fixed length masking is a single position mask . it masks out any symbol in a particular position or the lack of that position in a word . figure 2.3 gives an example of fixed term masking . it not only allows any character in the masked information-retrieval-system capabilities 33 position , but also accepts words where the position does not exist . fixed length term masking is not frequently used and typically not critical to a system . variable-length `` do n't cares '' allows masking of any number of characters within a processing token . the masking may be in the front , at the end , at both front and end , or imbedded . the first three of these cases are called suffix search , prefix search and imbedded character string search , respectively . the use of an imbedded variable-length do n't care is seldom used . figure 2.3 provides examples of the use of variable-length term masking . if '' * '' represents a variable-length do n't care then the following are examples of its use : '' `` computer '' suffix search `` computer * '' prefix search '' ? computer * '' imbedded string search of the options discussed , trailing `` do n't cares '' (prefix searches) are by far the most common . in operational systems they are used in 80-90 per cent of the search-terms (kracsony-81) and in may cases are a default without the user having to specify it .
