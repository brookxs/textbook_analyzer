4.2.3 summary we have been discussing relevance-feedback from the individual user 's point-of-view . weve focused on how this information might be collected and how it might be used , both in the short term to modify users ' retrievals and in a longer-term way to change the documents ' indices . now we want to consider a third use for relevance-feedback information . when we have more than one system to use for retrieval and would like to evaluate which is doing the better job , users ' assessments of retrieved documents ' relevance can be used as `` grades . '' if one system can consistently , across a range of typical queries , more frequently retrieve documents that the users mark as relevant and fewer that they mark as irrelevant , then that system is doing a better job .
