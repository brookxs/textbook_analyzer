1.1.1 working within the ir tradition if it seems to you that the last section has sidestepped many of the most difficult issues underlying foa , you 're right ! later chapters will return to redress some of these omissions , but the immediate goal of chapters 2 to 4 is to `` operationalize ' 3 foa to resemble a well-studied problem within computer-science , typically referred to as information-retrieval (ir) . ir is a field that has existed since computers were first overview 9 used to count words [belkin and croft , 1987] . even earlier , the related discipline of library-science had developed many automated techniques for efficiently storing , cataloging , and retrieving physical-materials so that browsing patrons could find them ; many of these methods can be applied to the digital documents held within computers . ir has also borrowed heavily from the field of linguistics , especially computational-linguistics . the primary journals in the field and most important conferences ^ other places to in ir have continued to publish and meet since the 1960s , but the field has taken on new momentum within the last decade . computers capable of searching and retrieving from the entire biomedical-literature , across an entire nation 's judicial system , or from all of the major newspaper and magazine articles , have created new markets among doctors , lawyers , journalists , students , everyone ! and of course , the-internet , within just a few years , has generated many , many other examples of textual collections and people interested in searching through them . the long tradition of ir is therefore the primary perspective from which we will approach foa . of course , every tradition brings with it tacit assumptions and preconceived notions that can hinder progress . in some ways , an elementary school student using the-internet to foa class-materials is related to the original problem considered by library-science and ir , but in many other ways it could n't be more different (cf. section 8.1) . in this text , `` foa '' will be used to refer to the broadest characterization of the cognitive-process and `` ir '' to this subdiscipline of computer-science and its traditional techniques . when we talk of the `` search-engine , '' this is not meant to refer to any particular implementation , but to an idealized system most typical of the many different generations and varieties of actual search-engines now in use . if you are using this text as part of a course , you may build one simple example of a search-engine . using figure 1.4 as a guide , well return to each of the three phases and be a bit more specific about each component of our search-engine . here , finally , the human question-answerer has been replaced by an algorithm , the search-engine , that will attempt to accomplish the same purpose . this figure also makes clear that the fundamental operation performed by a search-engine is a match between descriptive features mentioned by users in their queries and documents sharing those features . by far the most important kind of features are keywords . 10 finding out about query ^ retrieved documents match information-retrieval-system r indices documents figure 1.4 schematic of search-engine
