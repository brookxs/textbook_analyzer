6.1 introduction text is the main form of communicating knowledge . starting with hieroglyphs , the first written surfaces (stone , wood , animal skin , papyrus , and rice paper) , and paper , text has been created everywhere , in many forms and languages . we use the term document to denote a single unit of information , typically text in a-digital form , but it can also include other media . in practice , a document is loosely denned . it can be a complete logical unit , like a research article , a book or a manual . it can also be part of a larger text , such as a paragraph or a sequence of paragraphs (also called a passage of text) , an entry in a dictionary , a judge 's opinion on a case , the description of an automobile part , etc. . furthermore , with respect to its physical representation , a document can be any physical unit , for example a file , an email , or a world-wide-web (or just web) page . a document has a given syntax and structure which is usually dictated by the application or by the person who created it . it also has a semantics , specified by the author of the document (who is not necessarily the same as the creator) . additionally , a document may have a presentation style associated with it , which specifies how it should be displayed or printed . such a style is usually given by the document syntax and structure and is related to a specific application (for example , a web-browser) . figure 6.1 depicts all these relations . a document can also have information about itself , called metadata . the next section explains different types of metadata and their relevance . the syntax of a document can express structure , presentation style , semantics , or even external actions . in many cases one or more of these elements are implicit or are given together . for example , a structural element (e.g. , a section) can have a fixed formatting style . the semantics of a document is also associated with its use . for example , postscript directives are designed for drawing . the syntax of a document can be implicit in its content , or expressed in a simple declarative-language or even in a programming-language . for example , many editor formats are declarative while a tex document uses a powerful typesetting language . although a powerful language could be easier to parse than the data itself , it might be difficult to convert documents in that language to other formats . many syntax languages are proprietary and specific , but open 141 142 text and multimedia languages and properties document syntax text + structure + other media presentation style semantics figure 6.1 characteristics of a document . and generic languages are better because documents can be interchanged between applications and are more flexible . text can also be written in natural-language . however , at present the semantics of natural-language is still not easy for a computer to understand . the current trend is to use languages which provide information on the document-structure , format , and semantics while being readable by humans as well as computers . the standard-generalized-markup-language (sgml) , which is covered later on in this chapter , tries to balance all the issues above . metadata , markup , and semantic encoding represent different levels of formalization of the document contents . most documents have a particular formatting style . however , new-applications are pushing for external formatting such that information can be represented independently of style , and vice versa . the presentation style can be embedded in the document , as in tex or rich text format (rtf) . style can be complemented by macros (for example , latex in the case of tex) . in most cases , style is defined by the document author . however , the reader may decide part of the style (for example , by setting options in a web-browser) . the style of a document defines how the document is visualized in a computer window or a printed page , but can also include treatment of other media such as audio or video . in this chapter we first cover metadata . following that we discuss text characteristics such as formats and natural-language statistics . next we cover languages to describe text-structure , presentation style , or semantics . the last part is devoted to multimedia formats and languages .
