10.3.2 non-search parts of the information-access process the o'day and jeffries study [614] found that information-seeking is only one part of the full work-process their subjects were engaged in . in between searching sessions many different kinds of work was done with the retrieved information , including reading and annotating [617] and analysis . o'day and jeffries examined the analysis steps in more detail , finding that 80 % of this work fell into six main types : finding trends , making comparisons , aggregating information , identifying a critical subset , assessing , and interpreting . the remaining 20 % consisted of cross-referencing , summarizing , finding evocative visualizations for reports , and miscellaneous activities . the sensemaking work of russell et al. [690] also discusses information-work as a process in which information-retrieval plays only a small part . they observe that most of the effort made in sensemaking is in the synthesis of a good representation , or ways of thinking about , the problem at hand . they describe the process of formulating and crystallizing the important concepts for a given task . 266 user-interfaces and visualization from these observations it is convenient to divide the entire information-access process into two main components : search/retrieval , and analysis / synthesis of results . user-interfaces should allow both kinds of activity to be tightly interwoven , however , analysis/synthesis are activities that can be done independently of information-seeking , and for our purposes it is useful to make a distinction between the two types of activities .
