inexact top k document-retrieval thus far , we have focused on retrieving precisely the highest-scoring documents for a query . we now consider schemes by which we produce documents that are likely to be among the highest scoring documents for a query . in doing so , we hope to dramatically lower the cost of computing the documents we output , without materially altering the user 's perceived relevance of the top results . consequently , in most applications it suffices to retrieve documents whose scores are very close to those of the best . in the sections that follow we detail schemes that retrieve such documents while potentially avoiding computing scores for most of the documents in the collection . such inexact top - retrieval is not necessarily , from the user 's perspective , a bad thing . the top documents by the cosine-measure are in any case not necessarily the best for the query : cosine-similarity is only a proxy for the user 's perceived relevance . in sections 7.1.2 -7.1.6 below , we give heuristics using which we are likely to retrieve documents with cosine scores close to those of the top documents . the principal cost in computing the output stems from computing cosine similarities between the query and a large number of documents . having a large number of documents in contention also increases the selection cost in the final stage of culling the top documents from a heap . we now consider a series of ideas designed to eliminate a large number of documents without computing their cosine scores . the heuristics have the following two-step scheme : find a set of documents that are contenders , where . does not necessarily contain the top-scoring documents for the query , but is likely to have many documents with scores near those of the top . return the top-scoring documents in .
