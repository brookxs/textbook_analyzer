14.2.2 online retrieval-systems the use of the computer for bibliographic-information-retrieval was first demonstrated in the 1950s , and initiated by the national-library-of-medicine in 1964 using batch-processing [107] . also in the 1960s , federally funded projects were carried out to develop prototype online systems which were then implemented in government research laboratories . the first production service , lockheed 's 404 libraries and bibliographical systems dialog-system , was implemented for nasa and subsequently made available to other government locations before becoming a commercial activity in the early 1970s and undergoing several changes in ownership . today dialog operates worldwide with databases offered via the-internet to libraries and other organizations as well as individuals . with a few exceptions , database vendors do not produce information but rather make it available to searchers via a common search-interface . database vendors license databases from the producers , process the databases to introduce as much standardization as is feasible (e.g. , standard field names) , mount the database through the creation of inverted-indexes , create database descriptions and aids to searchers in a-standard-format , and conduct training-sessions for clients (see figure 14.1) . these organizations offer a value-added service by providing a common gateway to multiple databases . a database vendor may offer cross-database searches ; for example , dialog allows the searcher to search simultaneously a predetermined or searcher-selected grouping of databases to create a merged set of references , then process the set to remove duplicates .
