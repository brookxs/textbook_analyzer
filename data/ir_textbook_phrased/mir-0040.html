2.8 alternative probabilistic-models one alternative which has always been considered naturally appealing for quantifying document-relevance is the usage of probability-theory and its main streams . one such stream which is gaming increased attention concerns the bayesian-belief-networks which we now discuss . bayesian (belief) networks are useful because they provide a clean formalism for combining distinct sources of evidence (past-queries , past feedback cycles , and distinct query formulations) in support of the rank for a given document . this combination of distinct evidential sources can be used to improve retrieval-performance (i.e. , to improve the ` quality ' of the ranked list of retrieved documents) as has been demonstrated in the work of turtle and croft [771] . in this chapter we discuss two models for information-retrieval based on bayesian-networks . the first model is called inference-network and provides the theoretical basis for the retrieval-engine in the inquery-system [122] . its success has attracted attention to the use of bayesian-networks with information-retrieval-systems . the second model is called belief network and generalizes the first model . at the end , we briefly compare the two models . our discussion below uses a style which is quite distinct from that employed by turtle and croft in their original writings . particularly , we pay more attention to probabilistic argumentation during the development of the model . we make a conscious effort of consistently going back to the bayesian formalism for motivating the major design-decisions . it is our view that such an explanation strategy allows for a more precise argumentation which facilitates the task of grasping the subtleties involved . before proceeding , we briefly introduce bayesian-networks .
