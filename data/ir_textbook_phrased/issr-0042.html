3.3 automatic-indexing automatic-indexing is the capability for the system to automatically determine the index-terms to be assigned to an item . the simplest case is when all words in the document are used as possible index-terms (total document-indexing) . cataloging and indexing 59 more complex processing is required when the objective is to emulate a human indexer and determine a limited number of index-terms for the major concepts in the item . as discussed , the advantages of human indexing are the ability to determine concept-abstraction and judge the value of a concept . the disadvantages of human indexing over automatic-indexing are cost , processing index-terms methodology oil , wells , mexico , citgo , refineries , no linking of terms peru , bp , drilling (oil wells , mexico , drilling , citgo) linked (precoordination) (u.s. , oil refineries , peru , introduction) (citgo , drill , oil wells , mexico) linked (precoordination) (u.s. , introduction , oil refineries , peru) with position indicating role (subject : citgo ; linked (pre-coordination) action : drilling ; with modifier indicating role object : oil , wells modifier : in mexico) (subject : u.s. ; action : introduces ; object : oil refineries ; modifier : in peru) figure 3.2 linkage of index-terms time and consistency . once the initial hardware-cost is amortized , the costs of automatic-indexing are absorbed as part of the normal operations and maintenance costs of the computer-system . there are no additional indexing costs versus the salaries and benefits regularly paid to human indexers . processing-time of an item by a human indexer varies significantly based upon the indexer 's knowledge of the concepts being indexed , the exhaustivlty and specificity guidelines and the amount and accuracy of preprocessing via automatic file build . even for relatively short items (e.g. , 300 - 500 words) it normally takes at least five minutes per item . a significant portion of this time is caused by the human-interaction with the computer (e.g. , typing speeds , cursor positioning , correcting spelling errors , taking breaks between activities) . automatic-indexing 60 chapter 3 requires only a few seconds or less of computer time based upon the size of the processor and the complexity of the algorithms to generate the index . another advantage to automatic-indexing is the predictably of algorithms . if the indexing is being performed automatically , by an algorithm , there is consistency in the index term selection-process . human indexers typically generate different indexing for the same document . in an experiment on consistency in trec-2 , there was , on the average , a 20 per cent difference in judgment of the same item 's topics between the original and a second independent judge of over 400 items (harman-95) . since the judgments on relevance are different , the selection of index-terms and their weighting to reflect the topics is also different . in automatic-indexing , a sophisticated researcher understands the automatic process and be able to predict its utility and deficiencies , allowing for compensation for system characteristics in a search-strategy . even the end-user , after interacting with the system , understands for certain classes of information and certain sources , the ability of the system to find relevant items is worse than other classes and sources . for example , the user may determine that searching for economic issues is far less precise than political issues in a particular newspaper_based information-system . the user may also determine that it is easier to find economic data in a information database containing business weekly than the newspaper source . indexes resulting from automated-indexing fall into two classes : weighted-and unweighted . in an unweighted indexing system , the existence of an index term in a document and sometimes its word-location (s) are kept as part of the searchable data-structure . no attempt is made to discriminate between the value of the index-terms in representing concepts in the item . looking at the index , it is not possible to tell the difference between the main topics in the item and a casual reference to a concept . this architecture is typical of the commercial systems through the 1980s . queries against unweighted systems are based upon boolean-logic and the items in the resultant hit file are considered equal in value . the last item presented in the file is as likely as the first item to be relevant to the user 's information-need . in a weighted indexing system , an attempt is made to place a value on the index term 's representation of its associated concept in the document . an index term 's weight is based upon a fiinction associated with the frequency of occurrence of the term in the item . luhe , one of the pioneers in automatic-indexing , introduced the concept of the `` resolving power '' of a term . luhn postulated that the significance of a concept in an item is directly proportional to the frequency of use of the word associated with the concept in the document (luhn-58 , salton-75) . this is reinforced by the studies of brookstein , klein and raita that show `` content bearing '' words are not randomly distributed (i.e. , poisson distributed) , but that their occurrence `` clump '' within items (brookstein-95) . typically , values for the index-terms are normalized between zero and one . the higher the weight , the more the term represents a concept discussed in the item . the weight can be adjusted to account for other information such as the number of items in the database that contain the same concept (sec chapter 5) . cataloging and indexing 61 the query process uses the weights along with any weights assigned to terms in the query to determine a scalar value (rank value) used in predicting the likelihood that an item satisfies the query . thresholds or a parameter specifying the maximum number of items to be returned are used to bound the number of items returned to a user (see chapter 7) . the results are presented to the user in order of the rank value from highest number to lowest number . automatic-indexing can either try to preserve the original text of an item basing the final set of searchable index values on the original text or map the item into a completely different representation , called concept-indexing , and use the concepts as a basis for the final set of index values . the automatic-indexing techniques are introduced in this section and later described in detail in chapter 5 .
