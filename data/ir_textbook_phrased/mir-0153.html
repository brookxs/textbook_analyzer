8.6.2 regular-expressions and extended patterns general regular-expressions are searched by building an automaton which finds all their occurrences in a text . this process first builds a non-deterministic finite automaton of size o (ra) , where m is the length of the regular-expression . the classical solution is to convert this automaton to deterministic form . a deterministic automaton can search any regular-expression in o (n) time . however , its size and construction time can be exponential in m , i.e. o (m2m) . see figure 8.23 . excluding preprocessing , this algorithm runs at 6 mb/sec in the reference machine . recently the use of bit-parallelism has been proposed to avoid the construction of the deterministic automaton . the non-deterministic automaton is simulated instead . one bit per automaton state is used to represent whether the state is active or not . due to the algorithm used to build the non-deterministic automaton , all the transitions move forward except for ^ - transitions . the idea is that for each text character two steps are carried out . the first one moves forward , and the second one takes care of all the e-transitions . a function e from bit masks to bit masks is precomputed so that all the corresponding bits are moved according to the ^ - transitions . since this function is very-large (i.e. , 2m entries) its domain is split in many functions from 8 - or 16-bit submasks to 7n-bit masks . this is possible because e (b \ , . . b3) ~ e {b \) \ ... \ e (b3) , where b % figure 8.23 the non-deterministic (a) and deterministic (h) automata for the regular-expression b b * (b j b * a) . 220 indexing and searching are the submasks . hence , the scheme performs | `` m/8] or | ~ ra/16] operations per text character and needs [ra/8] 28 \ m/w] or [ra/16] 216 | `` m/it /] machine words of memory . extended patterns can be rephrased as regular-expressions and solved as before . however , in many cases it is more efficient to give them a specialized solution , as we saw for the extensions of exact searching (bit-parallel algorithms) . moreover , extended patterns can be combined with approximate-search for maximum flexibility . in general , the bit-parallel approach is the best equipped to deal with extended patterns . real times for regular-expressions and extended pattern searching using this technique are between 2-8 mb/sec .
