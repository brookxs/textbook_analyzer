2.5.1 basic concepts the classic models in information-retrieval consider that each document is described by a set of representative keywords called index-terms . an index term is simply a (document) word whose semantics helps in remembering the document 's main themes . thus , index-terms are used to index and summarize the document contents . in general , index-terms are mainly nouns because nouns have meaning by themselves and thus , their semantics is easier to identify and to grasp . adjectives , adverbs , and connectives are less useful as index-terms because they work mainly as complements . however , it might be interesting to consider all the distinct words in a document-collection as index-terms . for instance , this approach is adopted by some web-search-engines as discussed in chapter 13 (in which case , the document logical view is full text) . we postpone a discussion on the problem of how to generate index-terms until chapter 7 , where the issue is covered in detail . given a set of index-terms for a document , we notice that not all terms are equally useful for describing the document contents . in fact , there are index-terms which are simply vaguer than others . deciding on the importance of a term for summarizing the contents of a document is not a trivial issue . despite this difficulty , there are properties of an index term which are easily measured and which are useful for evaluating the potential of a term as such . for instance , consider a collection with a hundred thousand documents . a word which appears in each of the one hundred thousand documents is completely useless as an index term because it does not tell us anything about which documents the user might be interested in . on the other hand , a word which appears in just five documents is quite useful because it narrows down considerably the space of documents which might be of interest to the user . thus , it should be clear that distinct index-terms have varying relevance when used to describe document contents . this effect is captured through the assignment of numerical weights to each index term of a document . classic information-retrieval 25 let ki be an index term , dj be a document , and witj gt ; 0 be a weight associated with the pair (ki.dj) . this weight quantifies the importance of the index term for describing the document semantic contents . definition let t be the number of index-terms in the system and ki be a generic index term . k = {/ ci , ... , kt} is the set of all index-terms . a weight wtj gt ; 0 is associated with each index term ki of a document dj . for an index term which does not appear in the document-text , wij = 0 . with the document dj is associated an index term vector dj represented by dj = (wij , w2j , . ï ï , wt , j) - further , let gi be a function that returns the weight associated with the index term ki in any t-dimensional vector (i.e. , gi {dj) = wij) . as we later discuss , the index term weights are usually assumed to be mutually independent . this means that knowing the weight w % ^ associated with the pair (ki , dj) tells us nothing about the weight wi + ii3 associated with the pair (ki + i , dj) . this is clearly a simplification because occurrences of index-terms in a document are not uncorrelated . consider , for instance , that the terms computer and network are used to index a given document which covers the area of computer-networks . frequently , in this document , the appearance of one of these two words attracts the appearance of the other . thus , these two words are correlated and their weights could reflect this correlation . while mutual independence seems to be a strong simplification , it does simplify the task of computing index term weights and allows for fast ranking computation . furthermore , taking advantage of index term correlations for improving the final document-ranking is not a simple task . in fact , none of the many approaches proposed in the past has clearly demonstrated that index term correlations are advantageous (for ranking purposes) with general collections . therefore , unless clearly stated otherwise , we assume mutual independence among index-terms . in chapter 5 we discuss modern retrieval techniques which are based on term correlations and which have been tested successfully with particular collections . these successes seem to be slowly shifting the current understanding towards a more favorable view of the usefulness of term correlations for information-retrieval-systems . the above definitions provide support for discussing the three classic information-retrieval-models , namely , the boolean , the vector , and the probabilistic-models , as we now do .
