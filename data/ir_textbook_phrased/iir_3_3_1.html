implementing spelling-correction of various alternative correct spellings for a mis-spelled query , choose the `` nearest '' one . this demands that we have a notion of nearness or proximity between a pair of queries . we will develop these proximity measures in section 3.3.3 . when two correctly spelled queries are tied (or nearly tied) , select the one that is more common . for instance , grunt and grant both seem equally plausible as corrections for grnt . then , the algorithm should choose the more common of grunt and grant as the correction . the simplest notion of more common is to consider the number of occurrences of the term in the collection ; thus if grunt occurs more often than grant , it would be the chosen correction . a different notion of more common is employed in many search-engines , especially on the web . the idea is to use the correction that is most common among queries typed in by other users . the idea here is that if grunt is typed as a query more often than grant , then it is more likely that the user who typed grnt intended to type the query grunt . beginning in section 3.3.3 we describe notions of proximity between queries , as well as their efficient-computation . spelling-correction algorithms build on these computations of proximity ; their functionality is then exposed to users in one of several ways : on the query carot always retrieve documents containing carot as well as any `` spell-corrected '' version of carot , including carrot and tarot . as in (1) above , but only when the query-term carot is not in the dictionary . as in (1) above , but only when the original query returned fewer than a preset number of documents (say fewer than five documents) . when the original query returns fewer than a preset number of documents , the search-interface presents a spelling-suggestion to the end-user : this suggestion consists of the spell-corrected query-term (s) . thus , the search-engine might respond to the user : `` did you mean carrot ?
