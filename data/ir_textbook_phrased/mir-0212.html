10.8.1 interfaces for string-matching a common simple search need is that of the ` find ' operation , typically run over the contents of a document that is currently being viewed . usually this function does not produce ranked output , nor allow boolean combinations of terms ; the main operation is a simple string-match (without regular-expression capabilities) . typically a special purpose search window is created , containing a few simple controls (e.g. , case-sensitivity , search forward or backward) . the user-types the query string into an entry form and string matches are highlighted in the target document (see figure 10.26) . the next degree of complexity is the ` find ' function for searching across small collections , such as the files on a personal-computer 's hard-disk , or the history-list of a web-browser . this type of function is also usually implemented as a simple string-match . again , the controls and parameter-settings are shown at the top of a special purpose search window and the various options are set via checkboxes and entry forms . the difference from the previous example is that a results list is shown within the search-interface itself (see figure 10.27) . a common problem arises even in these very simple interfaces . an ambiguous state occurs in which the results for an earlier search are shown while the user is entering a new query or modifying the previous one . if the user-types in jhrcrr-aticn [i findnxt \ direction figure 10.26 an example of a simple interface for string-matching , from netscape-communicator 4.05 . 310 user-interfaces and visualization search for items in the htap list where ; search [title] contains j * j jberkeleii gear j help title location j firstvisfted] lastvisftedjexpiration | visit . . t _ searching uc ... `` the ` ljcberkeir '' '' berkeley pledge 1998berkeleya ... berkeleyanarc ... berkeley / pr ... berkeleyan/pr ... 02-25-98 berkel ... uc berkeley dir ... uc berkeley dir ... http : / / library , berkele ... http : / / www . urel . berk . . http : / / www . urel . berk . . http://www.urel.berk . . http://www.urel.berk . . http : / / www . urel . berk . . http : / / www . urel . berk . . http : / / www-resource . . http : / / www . berkeley ... 7/7/1998 ... 1 hours ago 1 hours ago 1 hours ago 1 hours ago 1 hours ago 1 hours ago 2 hours ago 7/22/199 ... 1 hours ago 1 hours ago 1 hours ago 1 hours ago 1 hours ago 1 hours ago 1 hours ago 1 hours ago 1 hours ago 1 hours ago 1 hours aqo 8/27/199 ...
