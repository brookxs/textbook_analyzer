1.3.5 multimedia-database search chapter 10 provides additional details associated with multi-media search against different modalities of information . from a system perspective , the multimedia-data is not logically its own data-structure , but an augmentation to the existing structures in the information-retrieval-system . it will reside almost entirely in the area described as the document database . the specialized indexes to allow search of the multi-media (e.g. , vectors representing video and still-images , text created by audio-transcription) will be augmented search structures . the original source will be kept as normalized digital real source for access possibly in their own specialized retrieval servers (e.g. , the real media server , oracle video-server , etc.) the correlation between the multi-media and the textual domains will be either via time or positional synchronization . time-synchronization is the example of transcribed text from audio or composite video sources . positional synchronization is where the multi-media is localized by a hyperlink in a textual item . the synchronization can be used to increase the precision of the search-process . added relevance weights should be assigned when the multi-media search and the textual-search result in hits in close proximity . for example when the image of tony blair is found in the section of a video where the transcribed audio is discussingtony blair , then the hit is more likely then when either event occurs independently . the same would be true when the jpeg image hits on tony blair in a textual paragraph discussing him in an html item . making the multi-media data part of the document database also implies that the linking of it to private and public index-files will also operate the same way as with text .
