7.7 bibliographic discussion our discussion on lexical-analysis and elimination of stopwords is based on the work of fox [263] . for stemming , we based our discussion on the work of frakes [274] . the porter-stemming algorithm detailed in the appendix is from [648] , while our coverage of thesauri is based on the work of foskett [261] , here , however , we did not cover automatic-generation of thesauri . such discussion can be found in chapter 5 and in [739 , 735] . additional discussion on the usefulness of thesauri is presented in [419 , 735] . regarding text-compression , several books are available . most of the topics discussed here are covered in more detail by witten , moffat and bell [825] . they also present implementations of text-compression methods , such as huffman and arithmetic-coding , as part of a fully operational retrieval-system written in ansi 190 text operations c. bell , cleary and witten [78] cover statistical and dictionary methods , laying particular stress on adaptive-methods as well as theoretical aspects of compression , with estimates on the entropy of several natural-languages . storer [747] covers the main compression techniques , with emphasis on dictionary methods . huffman-coding was originally presented in [386] . adaptive versions of huffman-coding appear in [291 , 446 , 789] . word-based-compression is considered in [81 , 571 , 377 , 77] . bounds on the inefficiency of huffman-coding have been presented by [291] . canonical codes were first presented in [713] . many properties of the canonical codes are mentioned in [374] . byte huffman-coding was proposed in [577] . sequential-searching on byte huffman compressed text is described in [577 , 576] . sequential-searching on ziv-lempel compressed data is presented in [250 , 19] . more recently , implementations of sequential-searching on ziv-lempel compressed text are presented in [593] . one of the first papers on arithmetic-coding is in [675] . other references are [823 , 78] . a variety of compression methods for inverted-lists are studied in [573] . the most effective compression methods for inverted-lists are based on the sequence of gaps between document numbers , as considered in [77] and in [572] . their results are based on run-length encodings proposed by elias [235] and golomb [307] . a comprehensive study of inverted-file compression can be found in [825] . more recently vo and moffat [790] have presented algorithms to process the index with no need to fully decode the compressed index .
