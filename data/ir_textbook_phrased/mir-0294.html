15.4.1 multilingual-documents one social issue with documents relates to culture and language [633] . whereas there are many causes of the movement toward english as a basis for global document models , representations , and access 421 scientific and technical interchange , digital librarys may actually lead to an increase in availability of non-english content . because digital librarys can be constructed for a particular institution or nation , it is likely that the expansion of digital librarys will increase access to documents in a variety of languages . some of that may occur since many users of information desire it from all appropriate sources , regardless of origin , and so will wish to carry out a parallel (federated) search across a (distributed) multilingual collection . the key aspects of this matter are surveyed in [613] . at the foundation , there are issues of character-encoding . unicode provides a single 16-bit coding-scheme suitable for all natural-languages [783] . however , a less costly implementation may result from downloading fonts as needed from a special server or gateway , or from a collection of such gateways , one for each special-collection [208] . the next crucial problem is searching multilingual collections . the simplest approach is to locate words or phrases in dictionaries and to use the translated terms to search in collections in other languages [387] . however , properly serving many users in many languages calls for more sophisticated processing [612] . it is likely that research in this area will continue to be of great importance to both the ir and digital-library communities .
