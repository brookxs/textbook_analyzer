15.6.2 metadata in the broadest sense , metadata can describe not only documents but also collections and whole digital librarys along with their services [50] . in a sense , this reflects movement toward holistic treatment like 5s . yet in most digital-library discussions , metadata just refers to a description of a-digital object . this is precisely the role played by library-catalog records . hence , cataloging schemes like marc are a starting point for many metadata descriptions [514] . while marc has been widely used , it usually involves working with binary records which must be converted for interchange . one alternative is to encode marc-records using some readable coding-scheme , like sgml [293] . another concern with marc is that there are a number of national versions with slight differences , as well as differences in cataloging practices that yield the marc-records . usmarc is one such version . it is very important in the digital-library field , and can be encoded using sgml , or easily converted to simpler metadata-schemes like the ` dublin-core ' [513] . other ` crosswalks ' exist between dublin-core (dc) , marc , and schemes like gils , proposed for a government-information locator service [598] . a mapping also exists between dc and the z39 .50 protocol discussed in the previous section [503] . dc is a simple scheme , with 15 core elements that can be used to describe any digital-object . what is of real import is that it has been widely accepted . that is because there have been years of discussion and development , focused around international-workshops [806 , 620 , 560 , 833 , 333] . the core elements include seven that describe content (title , subject , description , source , language , relation , and coverage) . there are four elements that deal with intellectual-property issues (creator , publisher , contributor , and rights) . finally , to deal with instances of abstract digital-objects , there are four other types (data , type , format , and identifier) . since digital-objects and their metadata often have to be interchanged across systems , the problem of packaging arises . the warwick framework , which evolved out of the same type of discussions leading to dc , deals with packages and connections between packages [472] . in general , such discussion about metadata is crucial to allow the move from traditional libraries (with their complex and expensive cataloging) , past the-web (with its general lack of cataloging and metadata) , to a reasonable environment wherein metadata is available for all sorts of digital-objects (suitable to allow the organization of vast collections in digital librarys [734]) . because the-web has need of such organization , this has become an interest of its coordinating body , the www consortium [84] . in 1996 , as concern increased about protecting children from exposure to objectionable materials , trends and research-issues 431 metadata-schemes became connected with censoring and filtering requirements . the problem was renamed for the more general case , in keeping with harvest 's treatment of ` resource-discovery , ' to ` resource-description . ' the resource-description-framework (rdf) thus became an area of study for the consortium [753] . it should be noted that rdf can lead to header information inside digital-objects , including those coded in sgml or html , as well as xml (see chapter 6 for more details) . in the more general case , however , rdf is essentially a scheme for annotating digital-objects , so alternatively the descriptions can be stored separately from those objects . these options bring us back to the warwick framework where there may be multiple containers , sometimes connected through indirection , of packages of metadata , like marc or dc . we see that digital librarys can be complex collections with various structuring mechanisms for managing-data and descriptions of that data , the so-called metadata . however , coding may combine data with metadata , as is specified in the guidelines of the text-encoding-initiative (tei) [670] . this reminds us of the complexities that arise when combining streams and structures , where there are many equivalent representations . we also see that for digital-library standards to be useful , such as appears to be the case for dc , the structures involved must be relatively simple , and have well understood related scenarios of use . while this now appears to work for data-interchange , further work is required for interoperability , i.e. , interchange through the streams involved in protocols .
