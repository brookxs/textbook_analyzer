6.2 metadata most documents and text-collections have associated with them what is known as metadata . metadata is information on the organization of the data , the various data domains , and the relationship between them . in short , metadata is ` data about the data . '' for instance , in a database-management-system , the schema metadata 143 specifies some of the metadata , namely , the name of the relations , the fields or attributes of each relation , the domain of each attribute , etc. . common forms of metadata associated with text include the author , the date of publication , the source of the publication , the document length (in pages , words , bytes , etc.) , and the document genre (book , article , memo , etc.) . for example , the dublin-core metadata element set [807] proposes 15 fields to describe a document . following marchionini [542] , we refer to this kind of information as descriptive-metadata , metadata that is external to the meaning of the document , and pertains more to how it was created . another type of metadata characterizes the subject matter that can be found within the document 's contents . we will refer to this as semantic-metadata . semantic-metadata is associated with a wide number of documents and its availability is increasing . all books published within the usa are assigned library-of-congress subject codes , and many journals require author-assigned key terms that are selected from a closed vocabulary of relevant terms . for example , biomedical articles that appear within the medigital libraryine (see chapter 3) system are assigned topical metadata pertaining to disease , anatomy , pharmaceuticals , and so on . to standardize semantic terms , many areas use specific ontologies , which are hierarchical taxonomies of terms describing certain knowledge topics . an important metadata-format is the machine readable cataloging record (marc) which is the most used format for library records . marc has several fields for the different attributes of a bibliographic entry such as title , author , etc. . specific uses of marc are given in chapter 14 . in the usa , a particular version of marc is used : usmarc , which is an implementation of ansi/niso z39 .2 , the american national standard for bibliographic-information interchange . the usmarc format documents contain the definitions and content for the fields that have to be used in records structured according to z39 .2 . this standard is maintained by the library-of-congress of the usa . with the increase of data in the web , there are many initiatives to add metadata information to web-documents . in the web , metadata can be used for many purposes . some of them are cataloging (bibtex is a popular format for this case) , content rating (for example , to protect children from reading some type of documents) , intellectual-property-rights , digital-signatures (for authentication) , privacy levels (who should and who should not have access to a document) , applications to electronic-commerce , etc. . the new standard for web metadata is the resource-description-framework (rdf) , which provides interoperability between applications . this framework allows the description of wreb resources to facilitate automated-processing of the information . it does not assume any particular application or semantic-domain . it consists of a description of nodes and attached attribute/value pairs . nodes can be any wteb resource , that is , any uniform resource identifier (uri) , which includes the uniform-resource-locator (url) . attributes are properties of nodes , and their values are text strings or other nodes (web-resources or metadata instances) . to describe the semantics , values from , for example , the dublin-core library metadata url can be used . other predefined vocabularies for authoring metadata are expected , in particular for content rating and for digital-signatures . in addition , currently . 144 text and multimedia languages and properties there are many web-projects on ontologies for different application-domains (see also chapters 13 and 15) . metadata is also useful for metadescriptions of nontextual objects . for example , a set of keywords that describe an image . these keywords can later be used to search for the image using classic text-information-retrieval techniques (on the metadescriptions) .
