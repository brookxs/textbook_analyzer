2.4 z39 .50 and wais standards there are two potential sources for any standard , those agreed to by an official standards organization and a de facto standard based upon high usage across a large user population . the standards organization most involved in information-systems standards in the united-states is the american national standards institute / national information standards organization (ansi/niso) in generating its z39 .50 , information-retrieval-application service-definition and protocol-specification . niso is the only organization accredited by ansi to approve and maintain standards for information-services , libraries and publishers . this standard is one of many standards they generated to support interconnection of computer-systems . its relationship to other standards can be seen in the open-systems interconnection (osi) basic reference-model (iso 7498) . in addition to the formal standard , a second de facto standard is the wais standard based upon its usage in the internet . in addition to standards associated with specific language-interfaces of information-retrieval-systems , there are attempts being made to standardize the architecture of information-systems . the largest de facto information-system is the-internet and the-internet engineering task-force is focusing on how the architecture of the-internet should be modified to allow future scalability and addressability of items on the internet . this architecture directly affects information-retrieval-system capabilities 45 commercial information-systems usage on the internet and the integratability of future-research into this environment . the z39 .50 standard does not specify an implementation , but the capabilities within an application (application service) and the protocol used to communicate between applications (information-retrieval-application protocol) . it is a computer to computer-communications standard for database searching and record retrieval . its objective is to overcome different system incompatibilities associated with multiple database searching (e.g. , unique user-interfaces , command-language , and basic search functions) . the first version of z39 .50 was approved in 1992 . an international version of z39 .50 , called the search and retrieve standard (sr) , was approved by the international organization for standardization (iso) in 1991 . z39.50-1995 , the latest version of z39 .50 , replaces sr as the international information-retrieval standard . the standard describes eight operation types : init (initialization) , search , present , delete , scan , sort , resource-report , and extended services . there are five types of queries (types 0 , 1,2 , 100 , 101 , and 102) . type 101 extends previous types allowing for proximity and type-102 is a ranked list query (yet to be defined) . the extended services include saving query results , queries , and updating the database . the client is identified as the `` origin '' and performs the communications functions relating to initiating a search , translation of the query into a standardized format , sending a query , and requesting return records . the server is identified as the `` target '' and interfaces to the database at the remote responding to requests from the origin (e.g. , pass query to database , return records in a standardized format and status) . the end-user does not have to be aware of the details of the standard since the origin function performs the mapping from the user 's query-interface into z39 .50 format . this makes the dissimilarities of different database-systems transparent to the user and facilitates issuing one query against multiple databases at different sites returning to the user a single integrated hit file . the communications between the origin and target utilize a dialogue known as z39 .50 association . z39 .50 not only standardizes the messages to be exchanged between the origin and target systems , but also the structure and the semantics of the search-query , the sequence of message exchange , and the mechanism for returning records (turner-95 , kunze-95) . the 1992 version of z39 .50 was focused on library-functions such as database searching , cataloguing and interlibrary-loan (primarily marc bibliographic record structure) . z39 .50 version 3 (in z39.50-1995) addresses additional functions to support nonbibliographic data such as fiill text-documents and images . it also begins to address some of the functions being defined as necessary to information-systems such as ranking values . z39.50-1995 has just been approved by niso and is published as the new standard (the latest information on z39 .5 q is available on the worldwide-web at http://ds.internic.net/z3950/z3950.html) . wide-area information-service (wais) is the de facto standard for many search environments on the internet . wais was developed by a project 46 chapter 2 started in 1989 by three commercial companies (apple , thinking-machines , and dow jones) . the original idea was to create a program that would act as a personal librarian . it would act like a personal-agent keeping track of significant amounts of data and filtering it for the information most relevant to the user . the interface concept was user entered natural-language statements of topics the user had interest . in addition it provided the capability to communicate to the computer that a particular item was of interest and have the computer automatically find similar items (i.e. , relevance-feedback) . the original corporate interest was in apple providing the user-interface , thinking-machines providing the processing power , and dow jones providing the data . the developers of wais pursued a generalized system of information-retrieval that could access data-collections all around the world (hahn-94 , levine94) on the internet . like other internet-services , free versions of wais were originally provided . some of the initial products migrated to a commercial company that sells and supports a wais system . a free version of wais is still available via the clearinghouse for networked-information-discovery-and-retrieval (cindir) called `` freewais . '' the original development of wais started with the 1988 z39 .50 protocol as a base following the client/server-architecture concept . at that time z39 .50 was focused on a bibliographic marc record structure against structured files . numerous deficiencies were identified in the z39 .50 protocol forcing the developers of wais to vary from the z39 .50 standard (orion-93) . the developers incorporated the information-retrieval concepts that allow for ranking , relevance-feedback and natural-language-processing functions that apply to full text searchable databases . since they were diverging from the standard , they decided to simplify their client-server interface . in particular they decided to have a nonmarkovian process . thus state-information is not kept between requests between clients and servers . this is one of the major differences between wais and z39 .50 compliant systems . the availability of freewais in the public domain made it the method of choice for implementing databases on the internet . the architecture gained significant momentum from the mandate that all u.s. government-agencies publish their material electronically and make it accessible to the general public . wais and the-internet became the standard approach for answering the mandate . additionally , many organizations are using wais as the engine to archive and access large amounts of textual-information . the appeal for wais is that , for public-domain-software , it represents a well tested and documented product that can be trusted with data . a substantial community continues to test , fix and enhance the basic system . the current trend is away from wais and to a standard internet interface (web-interface) and using one of the more powerful search systems . another activity being driven by the publishing and digital-libraries efforts is the creation of a unique way of identifying , naming and controlling documents in an information-retrieval environment . it has the same paradigm as information-retrieval-system capabilities 47 the tipster-architecture of separating the indexes and surrogate search structures from storing the actual item . the leader in this effort is the center for national research initiatives (cnri) that is working with the department-of-defense and also the american association of publishers (aap) , focusing on an internet implementation that allows for control of electronic published and copyright material . the cnri concept is based upon using a `` handle '' system where the handle is the unique network identifier of a-digital object . the aap prefers the term digital-object identifier over the term handle (cnri-97) . most computer-systems identify an item by the location it is stored (e.g. , uniform resource locators (urls) on the internet - see section 4.7 for more detail) . from a library and large information system perspective it is far more efficient to refer to items by name rather than location . there is still significant debate over whether the name should be just a unique-identifier (e.g. , a number) or also have semantic-content to the user . the term `` handle '' refers to this unique name . a handle server (similar to document-manager in tipster) ensures persistence , location-independence and multiple-instance management . persistence ensures that the handle is available to locate information potentially past the life of the organization that created the item to identify any locations of the item . location-independence allows for the movement of items with a mechanism for knowing their current location . multiple-instance allows keeping track of the location of duplicates of an item . inherent in this architecture is a unique `` handle '' naming authority (s) and servers to assign names and keep track of locations . this is similar to the domain-name servers used in networks , but is designed to handle orders of magnitude more objects in efficient fashion . in addition to the handle server-architecture , cnri is also advocating a communications protocol to retrieve items from existing systems . this protocol call repository archive protocol (rap) defines the mechanisms for clients to use the handles to retrieve items . it also includes other administrative functions such as privilege validation . the handle-system is designed to meet the-internet engineering task-force (ietf) requirements for naming internet objects via uniform resource names to replace urls as defined in the internet 's rfc-1737 (ietf-96) .
