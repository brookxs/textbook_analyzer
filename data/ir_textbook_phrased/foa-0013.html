1.4.3 document proxies do you remember the library 's original card catalogs , those wooden , beautifully constructed cabinets full of rows and rows of drawers , each full of carefully typed index cards ? the card catalog contained proxies abridged representations of documents , acting as their surrogate - for the books it indexed . no one expected the full text of the books to actually be found in the drawers . computerized card catalogs are only capable of supporting a similar function . they do allow more extensive indexing and efficient retrieval , from terminals that might be accessed far from the library building . at the heart of this system is a text-search-engine capable of matching features of a query against book titles j just like with the original index cards , however , retrieval is limited to some proxy of the indexed work , a bibliographic-citation , or perhaps even an abstract . the text of ultimate interest - in a book , magazine , or journal - remains physically quite distinct from the search-engine used to find it . as computer storage capacities and network-communication rates have exploded , it has become increasingly common to find retrieval-systems capable of presenting the full text of retrieved items . in the modern context , proxies extend beyond the bibliographic-citation information and subject-headings we associate with card catalogs and include a overview 21 document 's title , an article 's abstract , a judicial opinion 's headnote , or a book 's table-of-contents . the distinction between the search-engine retrieving documents and retrieving proxies remains important , however , for at least two reasons . first , the radically changing technical capabilities of libraries (and computers and networks more generally) can create conceptual confusion about just what the search-engine is doing . while it has been possible for a decade or more to get the full text of published journal-articles through commercial systems such as dialog and lexis/nexis , free access to these through your public-library would have been almost unheard of until quite recently . in fact , most libraries did not even try to index individual articles in their periodical collections . changing technical capacities , changes in the application of intellectual-property laws , changes in the library 's role , and resulting changes in the publishing industry are radically altering the traditional balance . even when all new publications are easily available electronically , the issue of retrospectively capturing previously published books and journals remains unresolved . looking far into the-future and assuming no technical , economic , or legal barriers to a complete rendering of any document in our corpus , there is still an important reason to consider document proxies . recall that foa is a process we are attempting to support and that retrieving sets of documents to show users is a step we expect to repeat many times . proxies are abridged versions of the documents that are easier for browsing users to quickly scan and react to (i.e. , provide relevance-feedback) than if they had to read the entire document . if a document 's title is accurate (if its abstract is well written , if its bibliographic-citation is complete) , this proxy may provide enough information for users to decide if it seems relevant j
