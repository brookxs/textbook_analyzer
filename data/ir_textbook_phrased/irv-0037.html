sequential-files a sequential file is the most primitive of all file-structures . it has no directory and no linking pointers . the records are generally organised in lexicographic-order on the value of some key . in other words , a particular attribute is chosen whose value will determine the order of the records . sometimes when the attribute-value is constant for a large number of records a second key is chosen to give an order when the first key fails to discriminate . the implementation of this file-structure requires the use of a sorting routine . its main advantages are : (1) it is easy to implement ; (2) it provides fast access to the next record using lexicographic-order . its disadvantages : (1) it is difficult to update - inserting a new record may require moving a large proportion of the file ; (2) random-access is extremely slow . sometimes a file is considered to be sequentially organised despite the fact that it is not ordered according to any key . perhaps the date of acquisition is considered to be the key value , the newest entries are added to the end of the file and therefore pose no difficulty to updating .
