14.4 libraries and digital-library projects libraries are concerned with enhanced , seamless access to electronic-information from all sources . these libraries [351] see the library 's web-pages , not the opac , as the entry point for library users . through the-web pages the user-gains access to the library-catalog , networked-information resources , and locally created information , (p. 5) through the-web , a single interface can provide access to the local opac and reference materials , as well as to remotely accessible databases in the sciences , humanities , and business , including full-text journals , newspapers , and directories . special-collections , in multimedia as well as text formats , become available to the user through the same gateway . many libraries , particularly academic and large public libraries , have undertaken digital-library projects to achieve interoperability , ease-of-use , and equity-of-access (see chapter 15) . two such projects , the los angeles public-library 's virtual electronic library project (http://www.lapl.org) , and university-of-pennsylvania 's digital-library (http://www.library.upenn.edu) are described in [351] . the-web not only provides integration in terms of resources and collections , but the accompanying standards which support interoperability lead to a uniform search architecture . with this approach , the traditional distinction between information-retrieval from opacs and from remote electronic databases is beginning to disappear .
