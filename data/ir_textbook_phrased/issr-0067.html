4.9 summary data-structures provide the implementation basis of search-techniques in information-retrieval-systems . they may be searching the text directly , as in use of signature and possibly pat trees , or providing the structure to hold the searchable data-structure created by processing the text in items . the most important data-structure to understand is the inverted-file system . it has the greatest applicability in information-systems . the use of n-grams has also found successes in a limited number of commercial systems . even though n-grams have demonstrated successes in finding information , it is not a structure that lends itself to representing the concepts in an item . there is no association of an n-gram with a semantic unit (e.g. , a word or word-stem) . judging the relative-importance (ranking) of items is much harder to accomplish under this data-structure and the algorithmic options are very limited . pat and signature data file-structures have found successful implementations in certain bounded-search domains . both of these techniques encounter significant problems in handling very-large-databases of textual items . the hypertext data structure is the newest structure to be considered from an information-retrieval-system perspective . it certainly can be mathematically mapped to linked-lists and networks . but the model of how dependencies between items as hyperlinks are resolved is just being considered . the-future high usage of this structure in information-systems make its understanding important in finding relevant-information on the internet . marchionini and shneiderman believe that hypertext will be used in conjunction with full-text-search tools (marchionini-88) . the stemming discussed in this chapter has the greatest effect on the human-resources it takes to find relevant-information . stemming can increase the ability of the system to find relevant item by generalizing many words to a single representation . but this process reduces precision . enough information has not been gathered to practically trade-off the value of the increase in recall versus the decrease in precision for different degrees of stemming . data-structure 103
