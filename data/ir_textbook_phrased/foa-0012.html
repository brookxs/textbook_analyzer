20 finding out about 1.4.2 corpora we have focused on individual documents , but of course the foa problem would not interest us except that we are typically faced with a corpus of millions of such documents , and we are interested in finding only the handful that are of interest . the actual number of documents and their cumulative size will matter a great deal , as some of our ir methods have time or space complexities that make them viable only within certain parameters . to pick a simple example , if you are trying to find a newspaper article (you read it a few days ago) for a friend , exhaustively searching through all the pages is probably quite effective if you know it was in friday 's paper , but not if you need to search through an entire month 's recycling pile ! similarly , a standard utility like the unix grep command can be a practical alternative if the corpus is small and the queries simple . card catalogs were the first search-engines
