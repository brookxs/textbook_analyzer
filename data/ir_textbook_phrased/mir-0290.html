15.1 introduction information-retrieval is essential for the success of digital-libraries (digital librarys) , so they can achieve high levels of effectiveness while at the same time affording ease-of-use to a diverse community . accordingly , a significant portion of the research-and-development efforts related to digital librarys has been in the ir area . this chapter reviews some of these efforts , organizes them into a simple framework , and highlights needs for the-future . those interested in a broader overview of the field are encouraged to refer to the excellent book by lesk [501] and the high quality papers in proceedings of the acm digital-libraries conferences . those more comfortable with online-information should refer to d-lib magazine [280] ; the publications of the national-science-foundation (nsf) , defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) , and national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) ` research on digital-libraries initiative7 (digital libraryi) [349] ; or online-courseware [268] . there also have been special issues of journals devoted to the topic [265 , 267 , 710] . recently , it has become clear that a global focus is needed [270] to extend beyond publications that have a regional [55] or national emphasis [221] . many people 's views of digital librarys are built from the foundation of current libraries [683] . capture and conversion (digitization) are key concerns [160] , but digital librarys are more than digital-collections [634] . it is very important to understand the assumptions adopted in this movement towards digital librarys [509] and , in some cases , to relax them [29] . futuristic perspectives of libraries have been a key part of the science-fiction literature [811] as well as rooted in visionary statements that led to much of the work in ir and hypertext [135] . digital librarys have been envisaged since the earliest days 415 416 digital-libraries of the ir field . thus , in libraries-of-the-future , licklider lays out many of the challenges , suggests a number of solutions , and clearly calls for ir-related efforts [516] . he describes and predicts a vast expansion of the world of publishing , indicating the critical need to manage the record of knowledge , including search , retrieval , and all the related supporting activities . he notes that to handle this problem we have no underlying theory , no coherent representation-scheme , no unification of the varied approaches of different computing specialties รณ and so must tackle it from a number of directions . after more than 30 years of progress in computing , we still face these challenges and work in this field as a segmented community , viewing digital librarys from one or another perspective : database-management , human-computer-interaction (hci) , information-science , library-science , multimedia-information and systems , natural-language-processing , or networking and communications . as can be seen in the discussion that follows , this practice has led to progress in a large number of separate projects , but has also made interoperability one of the most important problems to solve [624] . since one of the threads leading to the current interest in digital librarys came out of discussions of the-future of ir [264] , since people 's needs still leave a rich research-agenda for the ir community [197] , and since the important role of web-search systems demonstrates the potential value of ir in digital librarys [711] , it is appropriate to see how ir may expand its horizons to deal with the key problems of digital librarys and how it can provide a unifying and integrating framework for the digital library field . unfortunately , there is little agreement even regarding attempts at integrating database-management and text-processing approaches [325] . sometimes , though , it is easier to solve a hard problem if one takes a broader perspective and solves a larger problem . accordingly we briefly and informally introduce the k5s ' model as a candidate solution and a way to provide some theoretical and practical unification for digital librarys . we argue that digital librarys in particular , as well as many other types of information systems , can be described , modeled , designed , implemented , used , and evaluated if we move to the foreground five key abstractions : streams , structures , spaces , scenarios , and societies . ` streams ' have often been used to describe texts , multimedia-content , and other sequences of abstract items , including protocols , interactive dialogs , server-logs , and human discussions . ` structures ' cover data-structures , databases , hypertext networks , and all of the ir constructs such as inverted-files , signature-files , marc-records (see chapter 8 for more details) , and thesauri . `` spaces '' cover not only id , 2d , 3d , virtual-reality , and other multidimensional forms , some including time , but also vector-spaces , probability spaces , concept-spaces , and results of multidimensional-scaling or latent-semantic indexing . ` scenarios ' not only cover stories , hci designs and specifications , and requirements statements , but also describe processes , procedures , functions , services , and transformations รณ the active and time-spanning aspects of digital librarys . scenarios have been essential to our understanding of different digital-library user-communities '' needs [525] , and are particularly important in connection with social-issues [48] . ` societies ' cover these concerns especially regarding authors , librarians , annotators , and other stakeholders . for the sake of brevity we omit further definitions 417 direct discussion of this abstraction , especially since anthropologists , communication researchers , psychologists , sociologists , and others are now engaging in digital-library research . since the 5s-model can be used to describe work on databases , hci , hyper-bases , multimedia-systems , and networks , as well as other fields related to library-and-information-science , we refer to it below to help unify our coverage and make sure that it encompasses all aspects of digital librarys . for example , the 5s-model in general , and scenarios in particular , may help us move from a paper-centered framework for publishing and communicating knowledge [195] to a hybrid paper/electronic one with a variety of streams and spaces . the 5s-model is a simple way to organize our thinking and understand some of the changes that digital librarys will facilitate : the boundaries between authors , publishers , libraries , and readers evolved partly in response to technology , particularly the difficulty and expense of creating and storing paper-documents . new-technologies can shift the balance and blur the boundaries . [525] to ground these and other subsequent discussions , then , we explore a number of definitions of digital librarys , using 5s to help us see what is missing or emphasized in each .
