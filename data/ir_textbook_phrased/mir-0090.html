5.3.1 query-expansion through local-clustering adoption of clustering-techniques for query-expansion is a basic approach which has been attempted since the early years of information-retrieval . the standard approach is to build global structures such as association matrices which quantify term correlations (for instance , number of documents in which two given terms co-occur) and to use correlated terms for query-expansion . the main problem with this strategy is that there is not consistent evidence that global structures can be used effectively to improve retrieval-performance with general collections . one main reason seems to be that global structures do not adapt well to the local-context defined by the current query . one approach to deal with this effect is to devise strategies which aim at optimizing the current search . such strategies are based on local-clustering and are now discussed . our discussion is based on the original work by attar and praenkel which appeared in 1977 . we first define basic terminology as follows . definition let v (s) be a non-empty subset of words which are grammatical variants of each other . a canonical-form s ofv (s) is called a stem . for instance , if v (s) = {polish , polishing , polished} then $ = polish . for a detailed discussion on stemming algorithms see chapter 7 . while stems are adopted in our discussion , the ideas below are also valid for non-stemmed keywords . we proceed with a characterization of the local nature of the strategies covered here . definition for a given query q , the set d \ of documents retrieved is called the local document-set further , the set v / of all distinct words in the local document-set is called the local vocabulary . the set of all distinct stems derived from the set vi is referred to as si . we operate solely on the documents retrieved for the current query . since it is frequently necessary to access the text of such documents , the application of local strategies to the-web is unlikely at this time . in fact , at a client machine , retrieving the text of 100 web-documents for local analysis would take too long , reducing drastically the interactive nature of web-interfaces and the satisfaction of the users . further , at the search-engine site , analyzing the text of 100 web-documents would represent an extra spending of cpu-time which is not cost effective at this time (because search-engines depend on processing a high number of queries per unit of time for economic survival) . however , local strategies might be quite useful in the environment of intranets such as , for instance , the collection of documents issued by a large business company . further , local strategies might also be of great assistance for searching information in specialized document-collections (for instance , medical document collections) . local-feedback strategies are based on expanding the query with terms correlated to the query terms . such correlated terms are those present in local dusters built from the local document-set . thus , before we discuss local automatic local analysis 125 query-expansion , we discuss strategies for building local clusters . three types of clusters are covered : association clusters , metric clusters , and scalar clusters . association clusters an association cluster is based on the co-occurrence of stems (or terms) inside documents . the idea is that stems which co-occur frequently inside documents have a synonymity association . association clusters are generated as follows . definition the frequency of a stem si in a document dj , dj g di , is referred to as fs , l , j - let m = (mij) be an association-matrix with \ si \ rows and \ di \ columns , where mlj = fs % j. let fhl be the transpose of m . the-matrix s = mfht is a local stem-stem association-matrix . each element su ^ v in s expresses a correlation cu , v between the stems $ u and sv namely , the correlation factor cuiv quantifies the absolute frequencies of co-occurrence and is said to be unnormalized . thus , if we adopt su , v = cu , v (5.6) then the association-matrix s is said to be unnormalized . an alternative is to normalize the correlation factor . for instance , if we adopt then the association-matrix s is said to be normalized . the adoption of normalization yields quite distinct associations as discussed below . given a local association-matrix s , we can use it to build local association clusters as follows . definition consider the u-th row in the association-matrix s (i.e. , the row with all the associations for the stem su) . let su (n) be a function which takes the u-th row and returns the set of n largest values suiv1 where v varies over the set of local stems and v ^ u . then su (n) defines a local association cluster around the stem su . if su , v is given by equation 5.6 , the association cluster is said to be unnormalized . if su ^ v is given by equation 5.7 f the association cluster is said to be normalized . given a query q , we are normally interested in finding clusters only for the \ q \ query terms . further , it is desirable to keep the size of such clusters small this means that such clusters can be computed efficiently at query time . 126 query-operations despite the fact that the above clustering-procedure adopts stems , it can equally be applied to non-stemmed keywords . the procedure remains unchanged except for the usage of keywords instead of stems . keyword-based local-clustering is equally worthwhile trying because there is controversy over the advantages of using a stemmed vocabulary , as discussed in chapter 7 . metric clusters association clusters are based on the frequency of co-occurrence of pairs of terms in documents and do not take into account where the terms occur in a document . since two terms which occur in the same sentence seem more correlated than two terms which occur far apart in a document , it might be worthwhile to factor in the distance between two terms in the computation of their correlation factor . metric clusters are based on this idea . definition let the distance r (kt , kj) between two keywords kt and k3 be given by the number of words between them in a same document . if k2 and k3 are in distinct documents we take r (ki , kj) = oo . a local stem-stem metric correlation-matrix s is defined as follows . each element su , v of s expresses a metric correlation cu , v between the stems su and sv namely ; in this expression , as already defined , v (su) and v (sv) indicate the sets of keywords which have su and sv as their respective stems . variations of the above expression for cu , l. have been reported in the literature (such as l/r2 (ki , kj)) but the differences in experimental-results are not remarkable . the correlation factor cu ^ v quantifies absolute inverse distances and is said to be unnormalized . thus , if we adopt then the association-matrix s is said to be unnormalized . an alternative is to normalize the correlation factor . for instance , if we adopt (5.9) u ' v | v ' (m | x \ v (sv) \ then the association-matrix sis said to be normalized . given a local metric matrix s * . we can use it to build local metric clusters as follows . definition consider the u-th row in the metric correlation-matrix s (i.e. , the row with all the associations for tht stern su) . let su (n) be a function which automatic local analysis 127 takes the u-th row and returns the set of n largest values su ^ v , where v varies over the set of local stems and v ^ u . then su (n) defines a local metric cluster around the stem su . if su , v is given by equation 5.8 , the metric cluster is said to be unnormalized . if su ^ v is given by equation 5.9 , the metric cluster is said to be normalized . scasar clusters one additional form of deriving a synonymity relationship between two local stems (or terms) su and sv is by comparing the sets su (n) and sv (n) . the idea is that two stems with similar neighborhoods have some synonymity relationship . in this case we say that the relationship is indirect or induced by the neighborhood . one way of quantifying such neighborhood relationships is to arrange all correlation values su ^ in a vector su , to arrange all correlation values svil in another vector svi and to compare these vectors through a scalar measure . for instance , the cosine of the angle between the two vectors is a popular scalar similarity-measure . definition let su = (su , i , su $ - gt ; ï ï ï 1 su , n) and sv = (sw , i , sl , ,2 , ï - ï , sy , n) be two vectors of correlation values for the stems su and sv . further , let s = {su % v) be a scalar association-matrix . then , each su ^ v can be defined as \ su \ x kl the correlation-matrix sis said to be induced by the neighborhood . using it . a scalar cluster is then defined as follows . definition let su (n) be a function which returns the set of n largest values su , v , v y # u7 defined according to equation 5.10 . then , su {n) defines a scalar cluster around the stem su . interactive-search formulation stems (or terms) that belong to clusters associated to the query stems (or terms) can be used to expand the original query . such stems are called neighbors (of the query stems) and are characterized as follows . a stem su which belongs to a cluster (of size n) associated to another stem sv (i.e. , su g sv (n)) is said to be a neighbor of sv . sometimes , su is also called a searchonym of sv but here we opt for using the terminology neighbor . while neighbor sterns are said to have a synonymity relationship , they are not necessarily synonyms in the grammatical sense . often , neighbor steins represent distinct keywords which are though correlated by the current query-context . the local aspect of this correlation is reflected in the fact that the documents and stems considered in the correlation-matrix are all local (i.e. , dj e alt ; su ä v}) . 128 query-operations figure 5.1 stem su as a neighbor of the stem sv . figure 5.1 illustrates a stem (or term) su which is located within a neighborhood sv (n) associated with the stem (or term) sv . in its broad meaning , neighbor stems are an important product of the local-clustering process since they can be used for extending a search formulation in a promising unexpected direction , rather than merely complementing it with missing synonyms . consider the problem of expanding a given user-query q with neighbor stems (or terms) . one possibility is to expand the query as follows . for each stem sv ä q , select m neighbor stems from the cluster sv (n) (which might be of type association , metric , or scalar) and add them to the query . hopefully , the additional neighbor stems will retrieve new relevant documents . to cover a broader neighborhood , the set sv (n) might be composed of stems obtained using correlation factors (i.e. , cuilgt ;-rrb- normalized and unnormalized . the qualitative interpretation is that an unnormalized cluster tends to group stems whose ties are due to their large frequencies , while a normalized cluster tends to group stems which are more rare . thus , the union of the two clusters provides a better representation of the possible correlations . besides the merging of normalized and unnormalized clusters , one can also use information about correlated stems to improve the search . for instance , as before , let two stems $ u and sv be correlated with a correlation factor cu , v . if cu , v is larger than a predefined threshold then a neighbor stem of su can also be interpreted as a neighbor stem of sv and vice versa . this provides greater flexibility , particularly with boolean-queries . to illustrate , consider the expression (su - f sv) where the + symbol stands for disjunction - let su * be a neighbor stem of su . then , one can try both (sugt ; + sv) and (su-t-su ') as synonym search expressions , because of the correlation given by cu ^ v. automatic local analysis 129 experimental-results reported in the literature usually support the hypothesis of the usefulness of local-clustering methods . furthermore , metric clusters seem to perform better than purely association clusters . this strengthens the hypothesis that there is a correlation between the association of two terms and the distance between them . we emphasize that all the qualitative arguments in this section are explicitly based on the fact that all the clusters are local (i.e. , derived solely from the documents retrieved for the current query) . in a global context , clusters are derived from all the documents in the collection which implies that our qualitative argumentation might not stand . the main reason is that correlations valid in the whole corpora might not be valid for the current query .
