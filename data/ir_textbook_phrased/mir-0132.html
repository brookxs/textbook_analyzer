7.6 trends and research-issues in this chapter we covered various text transformation techniques which we call simply text operations . we first discussed five distinct text operations for preprocessing a document-text and generating a set of index-terms for searching and querying purposes . these five text operations were here called lexical-analysis , elimination of stopwords , stemming , selection of index-terms , and thesauri . the first four are directly related to the generation of a good set of index-terms . the fifth , construction of a thesaurus , is more related to the building of categorization hierarchies which are used for capturing term-relationships . these relationships can then be used for expanding the user-query (manually or automatically) towards a formulation which better suits the user-information need . nowadays , there is controversy regarding the potential improvements to retrieval-performance generated by stopwords elimination , stemming , and index-terms selection . in fact , there is no conclusive evidence that such text operations yield consistent improvements in retrieval-performance . as a result , modern retrieval-systems might not use these text operations at all . a good example of this trend is the fact that some web-search-engines index all the words in the text regardless of their syntactic nature or their role in the text . furthermore , it is also not clear that automatic-query-expansion using thesaurus-based techniques can yield improved retrieval-performance . the same can not be said of the use of a thesaurus to directly assist the user with the query-formation process . in fact , the success of the k yahoo! ' web-search-engine , which uses a term-categorization hierarchy to show term-relationships to the user , is an indication that thesaurus-based techniques might be quite useful with the highly interactive interfaces being developed for modern digital-library-systems . we also briefly discussed the operation of clustering . since clustering is more an operation of grouping documents than an operation of text transformation , we did not cover it thoroughly here . for a more complete coverage of clustering the reader is referred to chapter 5 . one text operation rather distinct from the previous ones is compression . while the previous text operations aim , in one form or another , at improving the quality of the answer set , the operation of compressing text aims at reducing space . i/o , communication-costs , and searching faster in the compressed text (exactly or approximately) . in fact , the gain obtained from compressing text is bibliographic discussion 189 that it requires less storage space , takes less time to be transmitted , and permits efficient direct and sequential access to compressed text . for effective operation in an ir environment , a compression-method should satisfy the following requirements : good compression-ratio , fast coding , fast decoding , fast random-access without the need to decode from the beginning , and direct searching without the need to decompress the compressed text . a good compression-ratio saves space in secondary-storage and reduces communication-costs . fast coding reduces processing overhead due to the introduction of compression into the system . sometimes , fast decoding is more important than fast coding , as in documentation-systems in which a document is compressed once and decompressed many times from disk . fast random-access allows efficient processing of multiple-queries submitted by the users of the information-system . we compared various compression-schemes using these requirements as parameters . we have seen that it is much faster to search sequentially a text compressed by a word-based byte huffman-encoding scheme than to search the uncompressed version of the text . our discussion suggests that word-based byte huffman compression (which has been introduced only very recently) shows great promise as an effective compression scheme for modern information retrieval-systems . we also discussed the application of compression to index-structures such as inverted-files . inverted-files are composed of several inverted-lists which are themselves formed by document numbers organized in ascending order . by coding the difference between these document numbers , efficient compression can be attained . the main trends in text-compression today are the use of semi-static word-based modeling and huffman-coding . the new results in statistical-methods , such as byte-huffman coding , suggest that they are preferable methods for use in an ir environment . further , with the possibility now of directly searching the compressed text , and the recent work [790] of vo and moffat on efficient manipulation of compressed indices , the trend is towards maintaining both the index and the text compressed at all times , unless the user wants to visualize the uncompressed text .
