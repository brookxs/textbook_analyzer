8.9 trends and research-issues in this chapter we covered extensively the current techniques of dealing with text-retrieval . we first covered indices and then online searching . we then reviewed set manipulation , complex-pattern-matching and finally considered compression techniques . figure 8.25 summarizes the tradeoff between the space needed for the index and the time to search one single word . o.ln space-complexity suffix tries indexed search suffix-trees (full inversion) suffix-arrays hybrid solutions / (block addressing) inverted-files `` x sequential search i boyer-moore and bdm families ^ ó kmp + shift-or brute-force m m log n n '' * - - ~ o.ln rnn time-complexity figure 8.25 tr.tdruif of index spare versus word-searching time . bibliographic discussion 227 probably the most adequate indexing-technique in practice is the inverted-file . as we have shown throughout the chapter , many hidden details in other structures make them harder to use and less efficient in practice , as well as less flexible for dealing with new types of queries . these structures , however , still find application in restricted areas such as genetic databases (for suffix-trees and arrays , for the relatively small texts used and their need to pose specialized queries) or some office-systems (for signature-files , because the text is rarely queried in fact) . the main trends in indexing and searching textual-databases today are ï text-collections are becoming huge . this poses more demanding requirements at all levels , and solutions previously affordable are not any more . on the other hand , the speed of the processors and the relative slowness of external devices have changed what a few years ago were reasonable options (e.g. , it is better to keep a text compressed because reading less text from disk and decompressing in main-memory pays off) . ï searching is becoming more complex . as the text-databases grow and become more heterogeneous and error-prone , enhanced query facilities are required , such as exploiting the text-structure or allowing errors in the text . good support for extended queries is becoming important in the evaluation of a text-retrieval-system . ï compression is becoming a star in the field . because of the changes mentioned in the time cost of processors and external devices , and because of new developments in the area , text-retrieval and-compression are no longer regarded as disjoint activities . direct indexing and searching on compressed text provides better (sometimes much better) time performance and less space-overhead at the same time . other techniques such as block addressing trade space for processor time .
