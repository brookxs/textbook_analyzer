11.3.1 request specification two different interfaces can be presented to the user for querying multimedia objects . the first type of interface is based on browsing and navigation . usually , due to the complex structure of multimedia objects , it may be useful to let users browse and navigate inside the structure of multimedia objects to locate the desired objects . such an approach is typically used in cad/cam/case environments due to the complex structure of the objects under consideration . navigation , however , is not always the best way to find multimedia objects , in that it may be heavily time consuming when the object desired is deeply nested . the second approach for selecting objects is therefore based , as traditionally in dbmss , on specifying the conditions the objects of interest must satisfy , by means of queries . queries , in turn , can be specified in two different ways : the first , typical of a traditional database-context , is to enter the query by using a specific query-language . however , in some cases (especially when images and audio data are considered) , a query-by-example approach is preferred . under this approach , queries are specified by using actual data inside a visual-environment ; the user provides the system with an object example that is then used to retrieve all the stored objects similar to the given one . for example , the user may choose a house and pose the query : ` retrieve all houses of similar shape and different color . ' this approach requires the use of a gui environment where the user can pick examples and compose the query object . in order to pick examples , the system must supply some domains , i.e. , sets of typical values , one for each object feature (see section 11.2) .
