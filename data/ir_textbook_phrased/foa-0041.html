3.2.5 more recent zipfian sightings the debate concerning these models dates back almost 40 years , but zipfian distributions and attempts to explain them continue to arise . for example , many have been struck by language-like properties exhibited by the long sequences of genetic codes found in the dna of all living species . that is , a simple `` alphabet '' of four nucleic acid base-pairs (bps) (a , c , g , t in dna) grouped into three-letter codons that mean one of twenty possible `` words '' corresponding to amino-acids has led many to wonder what we might learn by viewing the genome as a linguistic object [sereno , 1991] . mantegna et al. [mantegna et ai , 1994] was led to consider the `` word '' frequency distributions of such words in the dna `` corpus . '' they considered differences in the distributions across coding regions of the weighting and matching against indices 69 genome as well as noncoding regions that are never expressed . their first result is that this sequence-data does indeed contain `` linguistic-features , '' especially in the noncoding regions . by analyzing various genetic corpora (e.g. , approximately a million bps taken from 14 mammalian sequences) , they found that , in contrast to what we might expect of completely random sequences , the rank-frequency distribution of six-bp words could be well fit by a (log-log linear) zipf exponent equal to ó0 .28 . they conclude : these results are consistent with the possible existence of one (or more than one) structured biological languages present in noncoding dna-sequences . [mantegna et al. , 1994 , italic not in original] subsequent analysis , however , makes it quite clear that any such interpretations are ill-founded [bonhoeffer et al. , 1996] . deviations from fully random sequence behavior can be attributed to two simple characteristics of biological-sequence data . first , define h (n) to be the entropy of the distribution of n-length nucleotide sequences . then the redundancy r (n) of length n words is : r (n) = 1 - ^ 1 (3.3) in so the nonrandom r {1) reflects a simple increase with the variance of the four base-pairs , a well-known biological fact . further , very short range correlations between nucleic acids (easy to imagine given the basic threeletter genetic-code) means that in dna the most common words are simply combinations of the most probable letters , especially in regions of short repeats . there are still interesting questions (e.g. , why coding and noncoding regions differ in their nucleic acid frequencies) , but none that suggest any large-scale language-like properties within the dna-sequence . a final recent example of how zipf-like distributions arise is offered by analyses of www surfing behaviors [huberman et al. , 1998] and makes this same point (but cf. section 8.1 for more recent , apparently contradictory data generated from massive alta-vista logs) . consider each page click by a browsing user to be a `` character '' and the amount of time spent by the same user on a host to be the length of a 41 word . '' then (surprise !) , empirical-data capturing the rank-frequency 70 finding out about 1000 i * 100 o 10 1 10 100 1000 log (clicks) figure 3.2 rank/frequency distribution of click-paths from [huberman , 1998] . reprinted with permission of science distribution of each www surfing `` ride '' again show a (log-log linear) zipfian relationship with slope equal to ó1 .5 , as shown in figure 3.2 . huberman et al. also propose a model explaining this empirical-data . assume that the `` value '' (what we might think of as perceived relevance) v {l) of each page in a browsing sequence of length l goes up or down according to identical , independently distributed (iid) gaussian random variables 6 ^ : v (l) = v (l - 1) + äl (3.4) using economic reasoning , huberman et al. then hypothesize : ... an individual will continue to surf until the expected cost of continuing is perceived to be larger than the discounted expected value of the information to be found in the future ___ even if the value of the current page is negative , it may be worthwhile to proceed , because a collection of high value pages may still be found . if the value is sufficiently negative , however , then it is no longer worth the risk to continue . [huberman et al. , 1998] if users ' browsing-behaviors follow a random-walk governed by these considerations , huberman et al. show that the passage times to this cutoff threshold are given by the inverse gaussian-distribution : (3.5) weighting and matching against indices 71 where \ i is the mean of the random-walk length variable ly fi3/k is its variance , and a is a scaling parameter .
