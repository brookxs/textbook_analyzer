15.2 definitions since digital-library is a relatively new field , many workshops and conferences continue to have sessions and discussions to define a ` digital-library ' [266 , 347] . yet , defining digital librarys truly should occur in the context of other related entities and practices [315] . thus , a ` digital-archive ' is like a-digital library , but often suggests a particular combination of space and structure , and emphasizes the scenario of preservation , as in ` digital-preservation ' that is based upon digitization of artifacts . similarly , ` electronic preservation ' calls for media migration and format conversions to make digital librarys immune to degradation and technological obsolescence . maintaining integrity ' in a-digital library requires ensuring authenticity , handled by most regular libraries , as well as consistency , which is a concern whenever one must address replication and versioning , as occurs in database-systems and in distributed-information-systems . while these concerns are important , we argue that ` digital library1 is a broader concept . because it is true that the ` social , economic , and legal questions are too important to be ignored in the research-agenda in digital-libraries ' [525] , we really prefer definitions that have communities of users (societies) as part of a-digital library : digital librarys are constructed รณ collected and organized รณ by a-community of users . their functional capabilities support the information-needs-and-uses of that community . digital-library is an extension , enhancement , and integration of a variety of information institutions as physical places where resources are selected , collected , organized , preserved , and accessed in support of a user-community . [48] 418 digital-libraries this definition has many aspects relating to 5s , but largely omits streams , and only indirectly deals with spaces by calling for extensions beyond physical places . its coverage of scenarios is weak , too , only giving vague allusion to user-support . in contrast , definitions that emphasize functions and services are of particular importance to the development community [299] , as are definitions concerned with distributed-multimedia information-systems : the generic name for federated structures that provide humans both intellectual and physical access to the huge and growing worldwide networks of information encoded in multimedia digital formats . [97] while brief , this definition does tie closely with 5s , though it is weak on scenarios , only mentioning the vague and limited concept of ` access . ' to the ir community a-digital library can be viewed as an extended ir-system , in the context of federation and media variations [48] . also , digital librarys must support (large) collections of documents , searching , and cataloging/indexing . they bring together in one place all aspects of 5s , and many of the concerns now faced by ir researchers : multilingual-processing , search on multimedia-content , information-visualization , handling large distributed collections of complex-documents , usability , standards , and architectures , all of which are explored in the following sections .
