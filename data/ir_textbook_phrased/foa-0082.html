4.4.4 ravecompile ravecompile processes the votes recorded by interactive rave , creating a relevance-assessment file and some statistics about each query and subject . the first step is to map the four-valued relevance-assessments into the boolean relevant/nonrelevant discriminations typically used by standard ir-evaluation techniques . ravecompile lets the experimenter configure a simple predicate of the following form : 5 = a ï nposs + b ¶ nrel + c ï ncrit nvote = nposs + nrel + ncrit relp = (nvote gt ; quorum) a (5 * nvote gt ; minavg) where s = weighted aggregate score across relevance levels a = weight assigned to votes of `` possibly relevant '' b = weight assigned to votes of `` relevant '' c = weight assigned to votes of `` critically relevant '' nvote = total number of active votes collected for (q , d) pair quorum = minimum number of votes required for (q , d) to be considered relevant minavg = minimum weighted sum required for (q , d) to be considered relevant in one set of experiments [belew and hatton , 1996] , the data used two predicates constructed in this fashion . these are : 146 finding out about ï permissive : if (two or more possible votes) or (at least one relevant vote) ï stringent : if (two or more relevant votes) or (at least one critical vote)
