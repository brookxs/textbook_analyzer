5.4 automatic global-analysis the methods of local analysis discussed above extract information from the local set of documents retrieved to expand the query . it is well accepted that such a procedure yields improved retrieval-performance with various collections . an alternative approach is to expand the query using information from the whole set of documents in the collection . strategies based on this idea are called global-analysis procedures . until the beginning of the 1990s , global-analysis was considered to be a technique which failed to yield consistent improvements in retrieval-performance with general collections . this perception has changed with the appearance of modern procedures for global-analysis . in the following , we discuss two of these modern variants . both of them are based on a thesaurus-like structure built using all the documents in the collection . however , the approach taken for building the thesaurus and the procedure for selecting terms for query-expansion are quite distinct in the two cases .
