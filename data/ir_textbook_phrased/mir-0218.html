10.9 trends and research-issues the importance of human-computer-interaction is receiving increasing recognition within the field of computer-science [5871 . as should be evident from the 322 user-interfaces and visualization contents of this chapter , the role of the user-interface in the information-access process has only recently begun to receive the attention it deserves . research in this area can be expected to increase rapidly , primarily because of the rise of the-web . the-web has suddenly made vast quantities of information available globally , leading to an increase in interest in the problem of information-access . this has lead to the creation of new information access paradigms , such as the innovative use of relevance-feedback seen in the amazon.com interface . because the-web provides a platform-independent user-interface , investment in better user-interface-design can have an impact on a larger user population than before . another trend that can be anticipated is an amplified interest in organization and search over personal-information collections . many researchers are proposing that in future a person 's entire life will be recorded using various media , from birth to death . one motivation for this scenario is to enable searching over everything a person has ever read or written . another motivation is to allow for searching using contextual clues , such as cfmd the article i was reading in the meeting i had on may 1st with pam and hal ' . if this idea is pursued , it will require new , more sophisticated-interfaces for searching and organizing a huge collection of personal-information . there is also increasing interest in leveraging the behavior of individuals and groups , both for rating and assessing the quality-of-information items , and for suggesting starting-points for search within information-spaces . recommender-systems can be expected to increase in prevalence and diversity . user-interfaces will be needed to guide users to appropriate recommended items based on their information-needs . the field of information-visualization needs some new ideas about how to display large , abstract information-spaces intuitively . until this happens , the role of visualization in information-access will probably be primarily confined to providing thematic overviews of topic collections and displaying large category hierarchies dynamically . breakthroughs in information-visualization can be expected to have a strong impact on information-access systems .
