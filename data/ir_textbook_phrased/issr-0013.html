2 information-retrieval-system capabilities 2.1 search capabilties 2.2 browse capabilities 2.3 miscellaneous capabilities 2.4 standards 2.5 summary this chapter discusses the major functions that are available in an information-retrieval-system . search and browse capabilities are crucial to assist the user in locating relevant items . the search capabilities address both boolean and natural-language queries . the algorithms used for searching are called boolean , natural-language-processing and probabilistic . probabilistic-algorithms use frequency of occurrence of processing tokens (words) in determining similarities between queries and items and also in predictors on the potential relevance of the found item to the searcher . chapter 4 discusses in detail the data-structures used to support the algorithms , and chapters 5 and 7 describe the algorithms . the majority of existing commercial systems are based upon boolean-query and search capabilities . the newer systems such as topic , retrievalware , and inquery all allow for natural-language queries . with the introduction of multimedia searches comes new problems in how to represent queries in the different modalities and how to present the results of a search . given the imprecise nature of the search-algorithms , browse functions to assist the user in filtering the search-results to find relevant-information are very important . to allow different systems to inter-operate there are evolving standards in both the language and architecture areas . standardization of the interfaces between systems will have the same effect on information-systems that acceptance 28 chapter 2 of the structured-query-language (sql) has had in the database-management-system field . it will allow independent service-providers to develop tools and augmentations that will be applicable to any information-retrieval-system accelerating the development of functions needed by the user . examples of these functions are information-visualization tools and query-expansion tools .
