40 chapter 2 2.2.2 zoning when the user displays a particular item , the objective of minimization of overhead still applies . the user wants to see the minimum information needed to determine if the item is relevant . once the determination is made an item is possibly relevant , the user wants to display the complete item for detailed review . limited display screen sizes require selectability of what portions of an item a user-needs to see to make the relevance-determination . for example , display of the title and abstract may be sufficient information for a user to predict the potential relevance of an item . limiting the display of each item to these two zones allows multiple-items to be displayed on a single display screen . this makes maximum use of the speed of the user 's cognitive-process in scanning the single-image and understanding the potential relevance of the multiple items on the screen . related to zoning for use in minimizing what an end-user needs to review from a hit item is the idea of locality and passage_based search-and-retrieval . in this case the basic search unit is not the complete item , but an algorithmic defined subdivision of the item . this has been known as passage-retrieval where the item is divided into uniform-sized passages that are indexed (kaskiel-97 , knaus-95 , zobel-95) and locality_based retrieval where the passage boundaries can be dynamic (kretser-99 .) in these cases the system can display the particular passage or locality that caused the item to be found rather than the complete item . the system would also provide an expand capability to retrieve the complete item as an option .
