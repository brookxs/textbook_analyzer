cardinality - the number of clusters cardinality 16.3 since our goal is to optimize an objective-function , clustering is essentially a search-problem . the brute-force solution would be to enumerate all possible clusterings and pick the best . however , there are exponentially many partitions , so this approach is not feasible . for this reason , most flat clustering-algorithms refine an initial partitioning iteratively . if the search starts at an unfavorable initial point , we may miss the global optimum . finding a good starting point is therefore another important problem we have to solve in flat clustering .
