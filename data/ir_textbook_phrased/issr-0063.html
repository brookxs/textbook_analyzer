4.7.1 definition of hypertext-structure the hypertext data structure is used extensively in the internet environment and requires an electronic media storage for the item . hypertext allows one item to reference another item via an imbedded pointer . each separate item is called a node and the reference pointer is called a link . the referenced item can be of the same or a different data-type than the original (e.g. , a textual item references a photograph) . each node is displayed by a viewer that is defined for the file-type associated with the node . for example , hypertext markup-language (html) defines the internal-structure for information-exchange across the world-wide-web on the internet . a document is composed of the text of the item along with html tags that describe how to display the document . tags are formatting or structural keywords contained between less-than , greater than symbols (e.g. , lt ; titlegt ; , lt ; stronggt ; meaning display prominently) . the html-tag associated with hypertext linkages is lt ; a href = . . jname / agt ; where `` a '' and '' / a '' are an anchor start tag and anchor end tag denoting the text that the user can activate , `` href is the hypertext reference containing either a file name if the referenced item is on this node or an address (uniform-resource-locator - url) and a file name if it is on another node . '' #name '' defines a destination point other than the top of the item to go to . the url has three components : the access-method the client used to retrieve the item , the-internet address of the server where the item is stored , and the address of the item at the server (i.e. , the file including the directory it is in) . for example , the url for the html specification appears : http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/www/markup/html.html `` http '' stands for the hypertext-transfer-protocol which is the access protocol used to retrieve the item in html . other internet-protocols are used for other activities such as file-transfer (ftp : / /) , a specific text-search system (gopher : / /) , remote logon (tenet : / /) and collaborative newsgroups (news : / /) . the destination point is found in `` info.cern.ch '' which is the name of the `` info '' machine at cern with uchf being switzerland , and 47hypertext/www/markup / html.html '' defines where to find the file html.html . figure 4.14 shows an example of a segment of a html-document . most of the formatting tags indicated by lt ; gt ; are not described , being out of the scope of this text , but detailed descriptions can be 96 chapter 4 found in the hundreds of books available on html . the lt ; a href = ... gt ; are the previously described hypertext linkages . an item can have many hypertext linkages . thus , from any item there are multiple paths that can be followed in addition to skipping over the linkages to continue sequential reading of the item . this is similar to the decision a reader makes upon reaching a footnote , whether to continue reading or skip to the footnote . hypertext is sometimes called a `` generalized footnote . '' in a conventional item the physical and logical-structure are closely related . the item is sequential with imbedded citations to other distinct items or lt ; centergt ; lt ; img so'vimages / homejglo.jpg '' width = 468 height = 107 border = 0 alt = `` welcome to netscapegt ; lt ; brgt ; lt ; digital librarygt ; lt ; ahref = 7comprod/mirror/index . htmrgt ; lt ; ddgt ; the beta-testing is over : please read our report lt ; a href = `` http://www.charm.net/doc/charm/report/theme.html `` gt ; and your can find more references at href = `` http://www.charm.net/doc/charm/results/tests.html `` gt ; figure 4.14 example of segment of html locations in the item . from the author 's perspective , the substantive semantics lie in the sequential presentation of the information . hypertext is a non-sequential directed-graph structure , where each node contains its own information . the author assumes the reader can follow the linked-data as easily as following the sequential presentation . a node may have several outgoing links , each of which is then associated with some smaller part of the node called an anchor . when an anchor is activated , the associated link is followed to the destination node , thus navigating the hypertext network . the organizational and reference structure of a conventional item is fixed at printing time while hypertext nodes and links can be changed dynamically . new linkages can be added and the information at a node can change without modification to the item referencing it . conventional items are read sequentially by a user . in a hypertext environment , the user `` navigates '' through the node network by following links . this is the defining capability that allows hypertext to manage loosely structured information . each thread through different nodes could represent a different concept with additional detail . in a small and familiar network the navigation works well , but in a large information space , it is possible for the user to become disoriented . this issue is discussed in detail in chapters 5 , 7 , and 8 . quite often hypertext references are used to include information that is other than text (e.g. , graphics , audio , photograph , video) in a text item . the data-structure 97 multiple different uses for hypertext references are evolving as more experience is gained with them . when the hypertext is logically part of the item , such as in a graphic , the referenced file is usually resident at the same physical location . when other items created by other users are referenced , they frequently are located at other physical sites . when items are deleted or moved , there is no mechanism to update other items that reference them . linkage integrity is a major issue in use of hypertext linkages . dynamic-html became available with navigator 4.0 and internet-explorer 4.0 . it is a collective term for a combination of the latest html tags and options , style-sheets and programming that will let you create web-pages that are more animated and responsive to user-interaction . some of the features supported are an object-oriented-view of a web-page and its elements , cascading-style-sheets , programming that can address most page elements add dynamic fonts . object-oriented views are defined by the document object-model - dom (micorsoft calls this the dynamic-html object-model while netscape calls it the html object-model) . for example every heading on a page can be named and given attributes of text-style and color that can be manipulated by name in a small `` program '' or script included on the page . a style sheet describes the default style characteristics (page-layout , font , text size , etc) of a document or portion of a document . dynamic-html allows the specification of style-sheets in a cascading fashion (linking style-sheets to predefined levels of precedence within the same set of pages . as a result of a user-interaction , a new style sheet can be applied changing the appearance of the display . layering is the use of alternative style-sheets to vary the content of a page by providing content layers that overlay and superimpose existing content sections . the existing html programming capabilities are being expanded to address the additional data-structures . netscape is also allowing for dynamic fonts to be part of the-web page thus eliminating the font choice being dependent upon what the browser provides . since there is no international standard definition of dynamic-html , it is being defined in parallel by both microsoft and netscape thus precipitating differences in definition and function .
