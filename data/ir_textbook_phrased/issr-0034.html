2.5 summary chapter 2 provides an overview of the functions commonly associated with information-retrieval-systems . these functions define the user 's view of the system versus the internal implementation that is described throughout the rest of this book . until the early 1990s , the pressure on development of new-user functions that assist the user in locating relevant items was driven by the academic community . the commercialization of information-retrieval functions being driven by the growth of the-internet has changed the basis of development time from `` academic years '' (i.e. , one academic year equals 18 months - the time to 48 chapter 2 define the research , perform it and publish the results) to `` web years '' (i.e. , one web year equals three months - demand to get new products up very quickly to be first) . the test environment and test-databases are changing from small scale academic-environments to millions of records with millions of potential users testing new ideas . even ibm , one of the most traditional , conservative companies , has an `` alpha '' site available on the internet which contains the latest visualization and search software that is still in the process of being developing . the areas to expect web year changes in capabilities is in functions to assist the user in expanding his query , application of the above functions into a multilingual environment (i.e. , the-internet provides information in many languages) , and most importantly tools to support information-visualization capabilities . the short queries that the typical user enters return too much data . the research-community continues to development algorithms that is used to improve the precision-and-recall of the user 's search . automatic-learning from user 's queries coupled with large thesauri and concept dictionaries performs the query-expansion process . new visualization-tools have the most significant impact by allowing use of human cognitive processing to interpret the results of a user 's search statement and focus on the items that most likely are relevant . visualization-tools also assist the users in enhancing their queries to find needed information . the basic search capabilities described in this chapter will not change much , but significant improvements can be expected in the browse capabilities . the underlying reason for these advancements is the need to optimize the human-resource in finding needed information .
