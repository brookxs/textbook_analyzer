6.4 social-relations among authors another potential source of information about documents that we can use to augment statistial keywords is `` cultural '' information , capturing some features of the social-relationships among authors in a field . most of our discussion of documents has treated them as if they were completely dead artifacts . but documents are written by people ^ authors who write from a particular perspective . when their writing is in science or the law , or any other tradition within which they participate , we can make reasonable guesses about some aspects of what it is they are trying to say . an author 's education , in particular , offers clues as to how we can interpret their words . work and writing in many fields requires extensive graduate-education . students are soon moved from common `` core '' curricula to more advanced material . kuhn and others have analyzed the central role textbooks play as part of the social process of codifying a discipline [kuhn , 1970] . as students move beyond common textbooks to specialized training , their approach to the problem often resembles that of their teachers (at least as long as they are around the teacher) . by knowing something about the author 's education , and especially about his or her dissertation advisor , we may have a basis for interpreting the writing . the importance of dissertations as an academic resource was recognized as early as 1940 by university-microfilms inc. (umi) , as copies of virtually every dissertation published by many universities were microfilmed . umi (now the information and learning division of bell howell) makes its dissertation abstracts19 corpus available for www-searching . 17 www.yahoo.com i!t dmoz.org/about.htanl ! v wwwiib.umi.com/dissertations
