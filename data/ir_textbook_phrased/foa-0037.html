3.2.1 looking for meaning in all the wrong places (at the character level) the ubiquity of data obeying zipf * s law has made it a lightning rod , attracting a number of `` explanations . '' these explanations come from 64 finding out about an extremely impressive set of original thinkers , in widely ranging disciplines : ï noam chomsky , the most influential linguist of the past 30 years , together with george miller , the mathematical psychologist famous for such insights as the `` 7 ± 2 chunks '' of memory limitation [miller , 1957] ; ï herbert simon , the nobel prize-winning economist and one of the fathers of artificial-intelligence [simon , 1955] ; and ï benoit mandelbrot , the mathematician and physicist most famous for his work on fractals [mandelbrot , 1953] . herbert simon , a keen observer of much cognitive-activity , suggests that the ubiquity of zipf 's law across heterogeneous collections should make us somewhat suspicious of its ability to address the `` fine structure '' of linguistics : no one supposes that there is any connection between horse kicks suffered by soldiers in the german army and blood clots on a microscope slide other than that the same urn scheme provides a satisfactory abstract-model of both phenomena . it is in the same direction that we shall look for an explanation of the observed close similarities among the five classes of distributions ___ [simon , 1955] (with `` urn '' simon is referring to mathematical-models , e.g. , related to poisson-processes . see section 3.3.2 for more on the `` five classes '' of simon 's models .) we therefore begin this section by reviewing a number of early attempts to explain the phenomena underlying zipf * s law ; its mathematical derivation is reserved for chapter 5 .
