13.7.1 user problems we have already glanced at some of the problems faced by the user when interacting with the query-interfaces currently provided by search-engines . first , the user does not exactly understand the meaning of searching using a set of words , as discussed in chapter 10 . second , the user may get unexpected answers because he is not aware of the logical view of the text adopted by the system . an example is the use of uppercase letters when the search-engine is not case sensitive . hence , a word like ` bank7 loses part of its semantics if we search for ` bank . ' simple experiments also show that due to typos or variations of a word , even if correctly capitalized , 10-20 % of the matches can be lost . similarly , foreign names or words that are difficult to spell may appear incorrectly which may result in a loss of up to 50 % of the relevant answers , as mentioned in section 13.2 . another problem is that most users have trouble with boolean-logic . in natural-language , sometimes we use ` and7 and % or ' with different meaning depending on the context . for example , when choosing between two things , we use an exclusive `` or , ' which does not match the boolean interpretation . because of this , several studies show that around 80 % of the queries do not use any boolean or other operation . for these reasons many people have trouble using command query-languages , and query-forms should clearly specify which words must or must not be contained in a document that belongs to the answer . there are a few surveys and analyses of query-logs with respect to the usage of search-engines [647 , 403 , 728] , the latter reference is based on 285 million user sessions containing 575 million queries . table 13.6 gives the main results 390 searching the-web of that study , carried out in september 1998 . some of the strange results might be due to queries done by mechanized search agents . the number of queries submitted per day to altavista is over 13 million . users select a search-engine mainly based on ease-of-use , speed , coverage , relevance of the answer , and habit . the main purposes are research , leisure , business , and education . the main problems found are that novice-users do not know how to start and lack the general knowledge that would help in finding better answers . other problems are that search-engines are slow , that the answer is too large , not very relevant , and not always up to date . also , most people do not care about advertising , which is one of the main sources of funding for search-engines . when searching , 25 % of the users use a single keyword , and on average their queries have only two or three terms . in addition , about 15 % of the users restrict the search to a predefined topic and most of them (nearly 80 %) do not modify the query . in addition , most users (about 85 %) only look at the first screen with results and 64 % of the queries are unique . also , many words appear in the same sentence , suggesting that proximity-search should be used . there are also studies about users1 demographics and software and hardware used .
