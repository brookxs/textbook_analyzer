14.1 introduction despite the image sometimes presented of libraries as archaic collections of dusty books accessed through a card catalog , libraries were among the earliest institutions to make use of information-retrieval-systems . this early adoption took two main forms : searching remote electronic databases provided by commercial vendors in order to provide reference-services to patrons , and the creation and searching of catalog records for materials held within the library . each of these applications followed different developmental paths resulting in different products and functionality . according to hildreth [372] , proceeding along different paths , the developmental histories of online-public-access-catalogs (opacs) and conventional information-retrieval (ir) systems differed in three respects : origins of systems-development , file and database content , and intended users , (p. 10) initial development of information retrieval-systems was carried out by government laboratories in support of research in science-and-technology , based on bibliographic-databases containing largely textual-information , with trained search intermediaries as the intended users , opacs were developed initially inhouse by large , usually academic , library systems , and later by commercial vendors of turnkey systems , f they used standardized record formats , generally the marc record with minimal subject information (title , a few subject-headings , and a classification number) ; and unlike commercial ir systems , they were intended from the outset for end-users (library patrons) . these factors led to significant differences between commercial ir systems and opacs . f `` turnkey systems1 include software (and often hardware) and are usually developed with a specific library type and size in mind ; within the constraints of the system , some customizing to suit the particular library is often possible . 397 398 libraries and bibliographical systems developed independently of each other , information-retrieval-systems and opacs are quite different in character and use , and will be treated separately in this chapter . for these applications , a brief history , overview of current trends , some sample records and search examples will be given , and profiles of well-known systems will be presented . (topics related to the use of ir systems in libraries , through reference and technical services departments , and the techniques by which reference librarians perform the reference function , are beyond the scope of this chapter .) an important recent phenomenon , the digital library (see chapter 15) , has the potential to integrate information-retrieval functions in the library under a common interface , eliminating the distinction between locally held and remote resources . some examples of libraries which have attempted this integration will be discussed .
