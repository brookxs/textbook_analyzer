11.2.1 multimedia-data support in commercial dbmss most current relational dbmss support variable-length data-types which can be used to represent multimedia-data . the way these data are supported by commercial dbmss is mostly non-standard in that each dbms vendor uses different names for such data-types and provides support for different operations on them . for example , the oracle dbms provides the varchar2 data-type to represent variable-length , character strings . the maximum length of varchar2 data is 4000 bytes . the raw and long raw data-types are used for data that is not to be interpreted by oracle . these data-types can be used to store graphics , sounds , or unstructured objects . lob data-types can be used to store large unstructured-data objects up to four gigabytes in size . blobs are used to store unstructured binary large objects , whereas clobs are used to store character large object data . 330 multimedia-ir : models and languages the sybase sql-server supports image-and-text data-types to store images and unstructured-text , respectively , and provides a limited set of functions for their searching and manipulation . however , the support provided by the above mentioned data-types is very limited in that the dbms does not provide any interpretation of the data content . moreover , operations that can be performed on such data by means of the built-in functions provided by the dbms are very simple . as we have already remarked , most commercial relational dbmss vendors are investing a lot of effort in extending the relational-model with the capability of modeling complex-objects , typical of the object-oriented context . such efforts have given rise to the upcoming sql3 standard . prom a data-modeling point-of-view , the major improvement provided by sql3 with respect to its predecessor sql-92 , is the support for an extensible type-system . extensibility of the type-system is achieved by providing constructs to define user-dependent abstract-data-types , in an object-oriented like manner . in sql3 , each type specification consists of both attribute and function specifications . a strong form of encapsulation is provided , in that attribute values can only be accessed by using some system-functions . moreover , user-defined-functions can be either visible from any object or only visible in the object they refer to . both single and multiple inheritance can be defined among user-defined types and dynamic late-binding is provided [89] . sql3 also provides three types of collection data-types : sets , multisets , and lists . the elements of a collection must have compatible types . several system-defined operations are provided to deal with collections . besides the definition of user-dependent abstract-data-types , sql3 provides a restricted form of object-identifier that supports sharing and avoids data-duplication . although sql3 has not yet been officially published , most commercial products have already implemented their proprietary versions of sql3 . an example in such direction is the data cartridges provided by oracle for multimedia-data handling , or the data blades supported by illustra.f oracle provides data cartridges for text , spatial-data , image , audio and video data . to give a concrete example , oracles provides a context cartridge , which is a text-management solution combining data management capabilities of a traditional dbms with advanced text-retrieval and natural-language process-technology . the context cartridge supports the most popular document-formats , including ascii , ms word , and html . one of the most relevant feature of the context cartridge is its ability to find documents about a specific topic i thus providing a form of content-based-retrieval) . content-based-queries on text-documents can be combined with traditional queries in the same sql statement and can be efficiently executed due to the use of indexing-techniques specific for texts . such techniques are based on the notion of inverted-files (see chapter 8) which map a given word to the documents containing it , thus allowing a fast retrieval of all the documents containing a particular word . t ilhistni ` aits acquired by infoniiix in data-modeling 331 illustra provides 3d and 2d spatial-data blades for modeling spatial-data . the supported data-types include boxes , vectors , quadrangles , etc. , and examples of supported operations are intersect , contains , overlaps , center , and so on . spatial-data blades also implement r-trees for performing efficient spatial-queries [330 , 717] . the text-data blade provides data-types for representing unstructured-text and performing content-based-queries . for example , the method containwords can be used to search for all the documents containing a particular word . moreover , illustra supports a data blade which can be used to query images by content . the object-relational technology and its extensive type-system is now starting to be widely used both in industrial and research projects . an example of this trend is the la scala archive project , currently under development at the laboratorio di informatica musicale of the university of milano [254] . the goal of this project is the development of the multimedia-archive of teatro alia scala , one of the best known musical temples of the world , using the oracle technology and the related data cartridges . the system is organized around la scala nights . each night encompasses the phonic items , score , and other graphical and video items related to the performance . when a new performance has to be prepared , the musicians can easily access all the materials (such as cd-roms , video , photos , and scores) of previous editions of the same performance . accessing such information has required the development of ad-hoc cartridges to represent and query non-conventional data . for instance , we are currently developing a data-cartridge that allows content-based-queries on music-scores . we apply pattern-matching techniques to music-scores to enable the user to sing a few bars into a microphone linked to the computer and see all the music-scores containing a piece of music close to the one being sung . users can then view the retrieved musical graphic scores , or excerpts from them , and simultaneously play the corresponding music . as an example of a data-model suitable for a multimedia environment , in the following we consider the data-model developed in the context of the multos project [759] .
