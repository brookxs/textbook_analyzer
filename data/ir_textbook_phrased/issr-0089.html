6.2.2 automatic-term-clustering there are many techniques for the automatic-generation of term clusters to create statistical thesauri . they all use as their basis the concept that the more frequently two terms co-occur in the same items , the more likely they are about the same concept . they differ by the completeness with which terms are correlated . the more complete the correlation , the higher the time and computational-overhead to create the clusters . the most complete process computes the strength of the relationships between all combinations of the `` n '' unique-words with an overhead of o (n2) . other techniques start with an arbitrary set of clusters and iterate on the assignment of terms to these clusters . the simplest case employs one pass of the data in creation of the clusters . when the number of clusters created is very-large , the initial clusters may be used as a starting point to generate more abstract clusters creating a hierarchy . the steps described in section 6.1 apply to the automatic-generation of thesauri . the basis for automatic-generation of a thesaurus is a set of items that represents the vocabulary to be included in the thesaurus . selection of this set of items is the first step of determining the domain for the thesaurus . the processing tokens (words) in the set of items are the attributes to be used to create the clusters . implementation of the other steps differs based upon the algorithms being applied . in the following sections a term is usually restricted to be included in only one class . it is also possible to use a threshold instead of choosing the highest value , allowing a term to be assigned to all of the classes that it could be included in above the threshold . the automated-method of clustering documents is based upon the polythetic clustering (van rijsbergen-79) where each cluster is defined by a set of words and phrases . inclusion of an item in a cluster is based upon the similarity of the item 's words and phrases to those of other items in the cluster .
