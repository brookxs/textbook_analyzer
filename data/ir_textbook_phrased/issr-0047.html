3.5 summary this chapter introduces the concepts behind indexing . historically , term-indexing was applied to a hum an-generated set of terms that could be used to locate an item . with the advent of computers and the availability of text in electronic-form , alternatives to human indexing are available and essential . there is too much information in electronic-form to make it feasible for human indexing of each item . thus automated-indexing techniques are absolutely essential . when humans performed the indexing , there were guidelines on the scope of the indexing process . they were needed to ensure that the human indexers achieved the objectives of a particular indexing effort . the guidelines defined the level-of-detail to which the indexing was to be applied (i.e. , exhaustivity and specificity) . in automated systems there is no reason not to index to the lowest level-of-detail . the strength in manual-indexing was the associative powers of the human indexer in consolidating many similar ideas into a small number of representative index-terms and knowing when certain concepts were of such low value as to not warrant indexing . automated-indexing systems try to achieve these by using weighted-and natural-language-systems and by concept-indexing . the reliance of automated systems on statistical-information alone never achieve totally accurate assignment of importance weights to the concepts being indexed . the power of language is not only in the use of words but also the elegance of their combinations . the goal of automatic-indexing is not to achieve equivalency to human-processing , but to achieve sufficient interpretation of items to allow users to locate needed information with the minimum amount of wasted effort . even the human indexing process has left much to be desired and caused significant energy by the user to locate all of the needed information . as difficult as determining index-terms is , text-summarization encounters an even higher level of complexity . the focus of text-summarization is still on just the location of text-segments that adequately represent an item . the combining of these segments into a readable `` abstract '' is still an unachievable goal . in the near term , a summarization that may not be grammatically correct but adequately covers the concepts in an item can be used by user to determine if the complete item should be read in detail . cataloging and indexing 69 the importance of the algorithms being developed for automatic-indexing can not be overstated . the original text of items is not being searched . the extracted index information is realistically the only way to find information . the weaker the theory and implementation of the indexing algorithms is , the greater the impact on the user in wasting energy to find needed information . the global information infrastructure (e.g. , the-internet) is touching every part of our lives from academic instruction to shopping and getting news . the indexing and search-algorithms drives the success of this new aspect of everyday-life .
