recapitulation at this point i should like to summarise the formal argument thus far so that we may reduce it to simple english . one reason for doing this now is that so far i have stuck closely to what one might call a ` respectable ' theoretical-development . but as in most applied subjects , in ir when it comes to implementing or using a theory one is forced by either inefficiency or inadequate data to diverge from the strict theoretical-model . naturally one tries to diverge as little as possible , but it is of the essence of research that heuristic modifications to a theory are made so as to fit the real-data more closely . one obvious consequence is that it may lead to a better new theory . the first point to make then , is that , we have been trying to estimate p (relevance/document) , that is , the probability of relevance for a given document . although i can easily write the preceding sentence it is not at all clear that it will be meaningful . relevance in itself is a difficult notion , that the probability of relevance means something can be objected to on the same grounds that one might object to the probability of newton 's second law of motion being the case . some would argue that the probability is either one or zero depending on whether it is true or false . similarly one could argue for relevance . the second point is that the probability p (relevance/document) can be got at by considering the inverse probability p (x/relevance) , thus relating the two through bayes ' theorem . it is not that i am questioning the use of bayes ' theorem when applied to probabilities , which is forced upon us anyhow if we want to use probability-theory consistently , no , what i am questioning is that p (x/relevance) means something in ir and hence can lead us to p (relevance/x) . i think that we have to assume that it does , and realise that this assumption will enable us to connect p (relevance/x) with the distributional-information about index-terms . to approach the problem in this way would be useless unless one believed that for many index-terms the distribution over the relevant documents is different from that over the non-relevant documents . if we assumed the contrary , that is p (x/relevance) = p (x/non-relevance) then the p (relevance/document) would be the same as the prior-probability of p (relevance) , constant for all documents and hence incapable of discriminating them which is of no use in retrieval . so really we are assuming that there is indirect-information available through the joint-distribution of index-terms over the two sets which will enable us to discriminate them . once we have accepted this view of things then we are also committed to the formalism derived above . the commitment is that we must guess at p (relevance/document) as accurately as we can , or equivalently guess at p (document/relevance) and p (relevance) , through the distributional knowledge we have of the attributes (e.g. index-terms) of the document . the elaboration in terms of ranking rather than just discrimination is trivial : the cut-off set by the constant in g (x) is gradually relaxed thereby increasing the number of documents retrieved (or assigned to the relevant category) . the result that the ranking is optimal follows from the fact that at each cut-off value we minimise the overall risk . this optimality should be treated with some caution since it assumes that we have got the form of the p (x/wi) 's right and that our estimation rule is the best possible . neither of these are likely to be realised in practice . if one is prepared to let the user set the cut-off after retrieval has taken place then the need for a theory about cut-off disappears . the implication is that instead of working with the ratio we work with the ratio in the latter case we do not see the retrieval problem as one of discriminating between relevant and non-relevant documents , instead we merely wish to compute the p (relevance/x) for each document x and present the user with documents in decreasing order of this probability . whichever way we look at it we still require the estimation of two joint-probability functions . the decision-rules derived above are couched in terms of p (x/wi) . therefore one would suppose that the estimation of these probabilities is crucial to the retrieval-performance , and of course the fact that they can only be estimated is one explanation for the sub-optimality of the performance . to facilitate the estimation one makes assumptions about the form of p (x/wi) . an obvious one is to assume stochastic independence for the components of x . but in general i think this is unrealistic because it is in the nature of information-retrieval that index-terms will be related to one another . to quote an early paper of maron 's on this point : ` to do this [enlarge upon a request] one would need to program a computing machine to make a statistical-analysis of index-terms so that the machine will `` know '' which terms are most closely associated with one another and can indicate the most probable direction in which a given request should be enlarged ' [maron 's italics] [4] . therefore a more realistic approach is to assume some sort of dependence between the terms when estimating p (x/w1) and p (x/w2) (or p (x)) . i will now proceed to discuss ways of using this probabilistic-model of retrieval and at the same time discuss some of the practical-problems that arise . at first i will hardly modify the model at all . but then i will discuss a way of using it which does not necessarily accord strictly with the assumptions upon which it was built in the first place . naturally the justification for any of this will lie in the province of experimental tests of which many still remain to be done [17] . but first i shall explain a minor modification arising from the need to reduce the dimensionality of our problem .
