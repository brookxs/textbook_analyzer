8.2 cognition and perception the user-machine interface has primarily focused on a paradigm of a typewriter . as computers displays became ubiquitous , man-machine-interfaces focused on treating the display as an extension of paper with the focus on consistency of operations . the advent of wimp-interfaces and simultaneous parallel-tasks in the user work environment expanded the complexity of the interface to manipulate the multiple tasks . the evolution of the interface focused on how to represent to the user what is taking place in the computer environment . the advancements in computer-technology , information-sciences and understanding human-information-processing are providing the basis for extending the human-computer-interface to improve the information-flow , thus reducing wasted user overhead in locating needed information . although the major focus is on enhanced visualization of information , other senses are also being looked at for future interfaces . the audio sense has always been part of simple alerts in computers . illegal inputs are usually associated with a beep , and more recently users have a spectrum of audio sounds to associate with everything from start-up to shut down . the sounds are now being replaced by speech in both input-and-output interfaces . still in the research arena is the value of using audio to encapsulate information (e.g. , higher pitch as you move through an information-space plus increased relevance) . the tactile (touch) sense is being addressed in the experiments using virtual realty (vr) . for example , vr is used as a training environment for areas such as medical procedures where tactile-feedback plays an increasing role . olfactory and taste are two areas where practical use for information-processing or computer-interfaces in general has yet to be identified . for information-retrieval-systems , the primary area-of-interest is in information-visualization .
