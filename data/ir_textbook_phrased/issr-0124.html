10.5 video-retrieval the ability to support content-based access to video promises access to video-mail (jones et al. , 1997) , video taped meetings (kubala et al. 1999) , surveillance-video , and broadcast television . for example , maybury , merlino , and 250 chapter 10 morey (1997) report on the ability to create `` personalcasts '' from news broadcasts via the broadcast-news navigator (bnn) system . bnn is a web-based-tool that automatically captures , annotates , segments , summarizes and visualizes stones from broadcast-news-video . what qbic is to static stock imagery , bnn is to broadcast-news-video . bnn integrates text , speech , and image-processing technologies to perform multistream analysis of video to support content-based-search and retrieval . bnn addresses the problem of time-consuming , manual video acquisition/annotation techniques that frequently result in inconsistent , error-full or incomplete video catalogues . figure 10.5 illustrates bnn 's video query page . from this web-page , the user can select to search among thirty national or local news sources , specify an absolute or relative date range , search closed-captions or speech transcriptions , run a pre-specified profile , search on text keywords , or search on concepts that express topics or so-called named-entities such as people , organizations , and locations . in figure 10.5 a the user has selected to search all news-video sources for a 2 week period (27 february to 12 march , 2000) using free-text as well as person and location tags . as displayed in figure 10.5 b , bnn automatically generates a custom query web-page which includes menus of people and location-names from content extracted over the relevant time period to ease query-formulation by the user . in figure 10.5 b , the user has selected `` george bush '' and `` george w. bush '' from the people menu , `` new york '' and `` new york city '' from the location menu , and the key-words `` presidential primary '' . because bnn incorporates the alembic natural-language information extraction-system (www.mitre.org/resources/centers/it/g063/nl-index.htmn the retrieved results include only stories that contain the person `` bush '' as opposed to stories about brush or shrub and the state or city `` new york '' . broadcast neira r ^ vigatar stoiy sean * tool ssltctthe type ofmew jauw ^ thajmsaodof time , and the types cf ugsyou ars kttneutam , searching figure 10.5 a. initial query page multimedia-information-retrieval 251 closed-caption detailed text-search tool please enter or stdocttha words tint you ´ rs mlertstad tn jwarcfoag cm . ï to * atortimi % uit * in * iatsstonftrchowd (hmtiª ´ eml ^ ï toseleclimi ^ teiemamteitoailmsctr ^ ^ holddowiilhecmtmimdkrywb ^ makit ^ ydwbe ^ ^ figure 10.5 b. detailed content-based query figure 10.5 . broadcast-news navigator query-by-content figure 10.6 illustrates the kind of results bnn returns . figures 6a and 6b display a `` story skim '' in which a keyframe together with the three most frequently occurring named-entities are displayed for each relevant story . figure 10.6 a shows skims of those stories related to `` bush '' whereas 6b shows `` gore '' stories . when the user selects the first 5 march story (2nd row , far right) in figure 10.6 b , the display shown in figure 10.6 c is generated . in figure 10.6 c , when the user selects the closed-caption button next to this story , the closed caption/transcribed text displays as shown detailing the number of delegates each candidate has won to date . in this manner the user can directly access dozens of news stations with a single query and can rapidly perform detailed and comparative-analyses . in addition to this direct-access method , bnn also supports simple browsing of stories during particular time-intervals or from particular sources . a useful facility in this regard is the ability to display a graph of named-entity frequency over time . in addition , the user can automatically data mine the named-entities in the analyzed stories using the `` search for correlations '' link shown on the left panel in figure 3 0.6 . to evaluate the effectiveness of bnn , merlino and maybury (1999) report an empirical-study of the optimal presentation of multimedia summaries of broadcast-news with the belief that different mixes can improve user precision , recall , timeliness , and perceived-quality of interaction . in that study , the authors empirically investigated the most effective presentations for both retrieval (i.e. , finding relevant documents) and comprehension (i.e. , answer a question) using twenty users who 252 chapter 10 figure 10.6 a : `` george bush '' stories figure 10.6 b. `` al gore '' stories multimedia-information-retrieval 253 lei % :0 a ; 0022 lª so ^ whkre juu # the cakkoates ifthlyw the tzuocbxlxg partv hcoffitttjoh jjftocess !
