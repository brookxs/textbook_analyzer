inverted-files the importance of this file-structure will become more apparent when boolean searches are discussed in the next chapter . for the moment we limit ourselves to describing its structure . an inverted-file is a file-structure in which every list contains only one record . remember that a list is defined with respect to a keyword k , so every k-list contains only one record . this implies that the directory will be such that ni = hi for all i , that is , the number of records containing ki will equal the number of ki-lists . so the directory will have an address for each record containing ki . for document-retrieval this means that given a keyword we can immediately locate the addresses of all the documents containing that keyword . for the previous example let us assume that a non-black entry in the field corresponding to an attribute indicates the presence of a keyword and a black entry its absence . then the directory will point to the file in the way shown in figure 4.3 . the definition of an inverted-files does not require that the addresses in the directory are in any order . however , to facilitate operations such as conjunction (` and ') and disjunction (` or ') on any two inverted-lists , the addresses are normally kept in record number order . this means that ` and ' and ` or ' operations can be performed with one pass through both lists . the penalty we pay is of course that the inverted-file becomes slower to update .
