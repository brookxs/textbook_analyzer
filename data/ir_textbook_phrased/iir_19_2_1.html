the-web graph figure 19.2 : two nodes of the-web graph joined by a link . figure 19.2 shows two nodes a and b from the-web graph , each corresponding to a web-page , with a hyperlink from a to b . we refer to the set of all such nodes and directed-edges as the-web graph . figure 19.2 also shows that (as is the case with most links on web-pages) there is some text surrounding the origin of the hyperlink on page a . this text is generally encapsulated in the href attribute of the (for anchor) tag that encodes the hyperlink in the html code of page a , and is referred to as anchor-text . as one might suspect , this directed-graph is not strongly connected : there are pairs of pages such that one can not proceed from one page of the pair to the other by following hyperlinks . we refer to the hyperlinks into a page as in-links and those out of a page as out-links . the number of in-links to a page (also known as its in-degree) has averaged from roughly 8 to 15 , in a range of studies . we similarly define the out-degree of a web-page to be the number of links out of it . these notions are represented in figure 19.3 . a sample small web graph.in this example we have six pages labeled a-f . page b has in-degree 3 and out-degree 1 . this example graph is not strongly connected : there is no path from any of pages b-f to page a . there is ample evidence that these links are not randomly distributed ; for one thing , the distribution of the number of links into a web-page does not follow the poisson-distribution one would expect if every web-page were to pick the destinations of its links uniformly at random . rather , this distribution is widely reported to be a power-law , in which the total number of web-pages with in-degree is proportional to ; the value of typically reported by studies is 2.1 . furthermore , several studies have suggested that the directed-graph connecting web-pages has a bowtie shape : there are three major categories of web-pages that are sometimes referred to as in , out and scc . a web surfer can pass from any page in in to any page in scc , by following hyperlinks . likewise , a surfer can pass from page in scc to any page in out . finally , the surfer can surf from any page in scc to any other page in scc . however , it is not possible to pass from a page in scc to any page in in , or from a page in out to a page in scc (or , consequently , in) . notably , in several studies in and out are roughly equal in size , whereas scc is somewhat larger ; most web-pages fall into one of these three sets . the remaining pages form into tubes that are small sets of pages outside scc that lead directly from in to out , and tendrils that either lead nowhere from in , or from nowhere to out . figure 19.4 illustrates this structure of the web . the bowtie structure of the web.here we show one tube and three tendrils .
