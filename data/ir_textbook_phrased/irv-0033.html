introduction this chapter is mainly concerned with the way in which file-structures are used in document-retrieval . most surveys of file-structures address themselves to applications in data-management which is reflected in the terminology used to describe the basic concepts . i shall (on the whole) follow hsiao and harary [1] whose terminology is perhaps slightly non-standard but emphasises the logical nature of file-structures . a further advantage is that it enables me to bridge the gap between data management and document-retrieval easily . a few other good references on file-structures are roberts [2] , bertziss [3] , dodd [4] , and climenson [5] .
