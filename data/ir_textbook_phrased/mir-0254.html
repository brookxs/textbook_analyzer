13.4.1 centralized-architecture most search-engines use a centralized crawler-indexer architecture . crawlers are programs (software-agents) that traverse the-web sending new or updated pages to a main server where they are indexed . crawlers are also called robots , spiders , wanderers , walkers , and knowbots . in spite of their name , a crawler does not actually move to and run on remote machines , rather the crawler runs on a local system and sends requests to remote web-servers . the index is used in a centralized fashion to answer queries submitted from different places in the web . figure 13.3 shows the software-architecture of a search-engine based on the altavista architecture [17] . it has two parts : one that deals with the users , 374 searching the-web query-engine interface users crawler indexer web figure 13.3 typical crawler-indexer architecture . consisting of the user-interface and the query-engine and another that consists of the crawler and indexer modules . in 1998 , the overall altavista system was running on 20 multi-processor machines , all of them having more than 130 gb of ram and over 500 gb of disk space . only the query-engine uses more than 75 % of these resources . the main problem faced by this architecture is the gathering of the data , because of the highly dynamic nature of the-web , the saturated communication-links , and the high load at web-servers . another important problem is the volume of the data . in fact , the crawler-indexer architecture may not be able to cope with web growth in the near future . particularly important is good load-balancing between the different activities of a search-engine , internally (answering queries and indexing) and externally (crawling) . the largest search-engines , considering web-coverage in june 1998 , were altavista [17] , hotbot [380] , northern light [608] , and excite [240] , in that order . according to recent studies , these engines cover 28-55 % [749] or 14-34 % [490] of all web-pages , whose number was estimated at over 300 million in 1998 . table 13.2 lists the most important search-engines and their estimated sizes along with their corresponding urls . beware that some search-engines are powered by the same internal engine . for example , hotbot , goto , and microsoft are powered by inktomi [395] and magellan by exciters internal engine . up to date information can be found in [749 , 609] . most search-engines are based in the united-states and focus on documents in english . nevertheless , there are search-engines specialized in different countries and/or languages , which are able , for instance , to query and retrieve documents written in kanji (chinese , japanese , and korean) . also there are search-engines that take other approaches , like ask jeeves ! which simulates an interview [34] or directhit [215] which ranks the-web pages in the answer in order of their popularity . we should also mention those search-engines aimed at specific topics , for example the search broker [537] which allows us to search in many specific topics and dejanews [212] which searches the usenet archives . search-engines 375 search-engine url web-pages indexed altavista www.altavista.com 140 aol netfind www.aol.com/netfind/ excite www.excite.com 55 google google.stanford.edu 25 goto goto.com hotbot www.hotbot.com 110 infoseek www.infoseek.com 30 lycos www.lycos.com 30 magellan www.mckinley.com 55 microsoft search.msn.com _ northernlight www . nlsearch . com 67 web-crawler www.webcrawler.com 2 table 13.2 urls and estimated size (millions) of the largest search-engines (may 1998) . there are also engines to retrieve specific web-pages such as personal or institutional home-pages or specific objects such as electronic-mail addresses , images , or software applets .
