6.13 legal citation the use of citation in legal documents is interesting for a number of reasons [rose , 1994 , section 5.4] . first , the common law tradition adjudicating legal behavior is based on arguments of stare decisis : stand by previous decision . * the ability to reference prior judicial opinions u.s. courts are provides the core of many forms of documents , including the judicial latitudmarian ! 192 finding out about opinions themselves , briefs , even legislation . it is no wonder , then , that legal prose has developed an extensive system of conventions for representing how judicial opinions relate to one another . as with scientific papers , the fact of citation - reference by one judge to the opinion of another - is never in doubt , and so some analyses like impact-analysis transfer quite directly from scientific-corpora . (the fact that the publishing of our courts ' opinions is dependent on commercial interests means that precedent inflation [brenner , 1992] can occur , precedent however . ^ see section 6.7 .) but when referring to prior cases , the inflation relevance of prior decisions often depends on the judge 's interpretation of the relation holding between the two opinions . in fact , an entire industry exists within legal publishing to do nothing but elaborate the syntactic fact of reference to a prior ruling with an interpretation of the purpose for which the citation is made . this process is performed especially well by shepard/lexis . so critical are the arguments captured by these citations that the process of checking a prior ruling that a lawyer wishes to reference , to be sure that it has n't been overruled or otherwise rendered obsolete , is known as shepardizing a case . table 6.2 shows the entire range of shepard citation labels . these are broken into two categories ; the first deals with the history of a case , the second with its treatment . to make sense of this distinction , a brief digression into the purpose of legal citation is necessary . cases , as they proceed from lower to higher courts , have basically a binary outcome : they are won or lost . there is never ambiguity as to whether a higher court agrees with or overrules the opinion of a lower court . these unambiguous statements are captured as the history of a case . but in a common law tradition , a much larger number of citations refer to cases and decisions in those cases by other judges . the relationship between these cases and the one before the author-judge is less clear . but as figure 6.4 makes explicit , the two cases (citing and cited) have at least two important dimensions along which they may be similar or dissimilar . first , the set of facts associated with one case maybe very close to those in the other , or they may be very different . second , the rules of law that are to be applied may be consistent between one judge and the other , or they may be contrary . figure 6.4 shows these two dimensions and orders shepard 's treatment labels roughly along dimensions of this two-dimensional similarity space . inference beyond the index 193 table 6.2 shepard citation labels from [rose , 1994] . reproduced with permission of lawrence erlbaum code description a affirmed cc connected case cf certiorari filed de denied dm dismissed gr granted in us cert denied us cert dismissed us reh denied us reh dismissed m modified mi mandate issued np not published pd petition denied pg petition granted r reversed s superseded sc same case v vacated c criticized d distinguished e explained ex examiner s decision f followed h harmonized j dissenting l limited o overruled p parallel comments history of case same case affirmed on appeal different case from cited case but arising out of same subject matter or intimately connected therewith appeal from same case dismissed certiorari denied by u.s. supreme court certiorari dismissed by u.s. supreme court rehearing denied by u.s. supreme court rehearing dismissed by u.s. supreme court same case modified on appeal same case reversed on appeal substitution for former opinion same case vacated treatment of case soundness of decision or reasoning in cited case criticized case at bar different either in law or fact from case cited statement of import of decision in cited case not merely a restatement of the facts cited as controlling apparent inconsistency explained and shown not to exist citation in dissenting opinion refusal to extend decision of cited case beyond precise issues involved ruling in cited case expressly overruled citing case substantially alike (`` on all fours '') with cited case in its law or facts soundness of decision or reasoning in cited case questioned questioned
