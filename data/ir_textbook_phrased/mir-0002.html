1.1 motivation information-retrieval (ir) deals with the representation , storage , organization of , and access-to-information items . the representation and organization of the information items should provide the user with easy access to the information in which he is interested . unfortunately , characterization of the user-information need is not a simple problem . consider , for instance , the following hypothetical user-information need in the context of the world-wide-web (or just the-web) : find all the pages (documents) containing information on college tennis teams which : (1) are maintained by an university in the usa and (2) participate in the ncaa tennis tournament . to be relevant , the page must include information on the national ranking of the team in the last three years and the email or phone-number of the team coach . clearly , this full description of the user-information need can not be used directly to request information using the current interfaces of web-search-engines . instead , the user must first translate this information-need into a query which can be processed by the search-engine (or ir-system) . in its most common form , this translation yields a set of keywords (or index-terms) which summarizes the description of the user-information need . given the user-query , the key goal of an ir-system is to retrieve information which might be useful or relevant to the user . the emphasis is on the retrieval of information as opposed to the retrieval of data .
