probability-estimates in practice (76) idf 6.2.1 the approximation technique in equation 76 can not easily be extended to relevant documents . the quantity can be estimated in various ways : we can use the frequency of term occurrence in known relevant documents (if we know some) . this is the basis of probabilistic-approaches to relevance-feedback weighting in a feedback-loop , discussed in the next subsection . croft and harper (1979) proposed using a constant in their combination match model . for instance , we might assume that is constant over all terms in the query and that . this means that each term has even odds of appearing in a relevant-document , and so the and factors cancel out in the expression for . such an estimate is weak , but does n't disagree violently with our hopes for the search-terms appearing in many but not all relevant documents . combining this method with our earlier approximation for , the document ranking is determined simply by which query terms occur in documents scaled by their idf weighting . for short documents (titles or abstracts) in situations in which iterative searching is undesirable , using this weighting term alone can be quite satisfactory , although in many other circumstances we would like to do better . greiff (1998) argues that the constant estimate of in the croft and harper (1979) model is theoretically problematic and not observed empirically : as might be expected , is shown to rise with . based on his data-analysis , a plausible proposal would be to use the estimate . iterative-methods of estimation , which combine some of the above ideas , are discussed in the next subsection .
