1.1 definition of information-retrieval-system an information-retrieval-system is a system that is capable of storage , retrieval , and maintenance of information . information in this context can be composed of text (including numeric and date data) , images , audio , video and other multi-media objects . although the form of an object in an information-retrieval-system is diverse , the text aspect has been the only data-type that lent itself to fall functional processing . the other data-types have been treated as highly informative sources , but are primarily linked for retrieval based upon search of the text . techniques are beginning to emerge to search these other media types (e.g. , excalibur 's visual retrievaiware , virage video indexer) . the focus of this book is on research and implementation of search , retrieval and representation of textual and multimedia sources . commercial development of pattern-matching against other data-types is starting to be a common function integrated within the total information-system . in some systems the text may only be an identifier to display another associated data-type that holds the substantive information desired by the system 's users (e.g. , using closed captioning to locate video of interest .) the term uuser '' in this book represents an end-user of the information-system who has minimal knowledge of computers and technical fields in general . the term `` item '' is used to represent the smallest complete unit that is processed and manipulated by the system . the definition of item varies by how a specific source treats information . a complete document , such as a book , newspaper or magazine could be an item . at other times each chapter , or article may be defined as an item . as sources vary and systems include more complex processing , an item may address even lower levels-of-abstraction such as a contiguous passage of text or a paragraph . for readability , throughout this book the terms `` item '' and `` document '' are not in this rigorous definition , but used introduction to information-retrieval-systems interchangeably . whichever is used , they represent the concept of an item . for most of the book it is best to consider an item as text . but in reality an item may be a combination of many modals of information . for example a video news program could be considered an item . it is composed of text in the form of closed captioning , audio text provided by the speakers , and the video images being displayed . there are multiple `` tracks '' of information possible in a single item . they are typically correlated by time . where the text discusses multimedia-information-retrieval keep this expanded model in mind . an information-retrieval-system consists of a software-program that facilitates a user in finding the information the user-needs . the system may use standard computer-hardware or specialized-hardware to support the search subftmction and to convert non-textual sources to a searchable media (e.g. , transcription of audio to text) . the gauge of success of an information-system is how well it can minimize the overhead for a user to find the needed information . overhead from a user 's perspective is the time required to find the information needed , excluding the time for actually reading the relevant data . thus search composition , search execution , and reading non-relevant items are all aspects of information-retrieval overhead . the first information-retrieval-systems originated with the need to organize information in central repositories (e.g. , libraries) (hyman-82) . catalogues were created to facilitate the identification and retrieval of items . chapter 3 reviews the history of cataloging and indexing . original definitions focused on `` documents '' for information-retrieval (or their surrogates) rather than the multi-media integrated information that is now available (minker-77 , minker77 .) as computers became commercially available , they were obvious candidates for the storage-and-retrieval of text . early introduction of database-management-systems provided an ideal platform for electronic manipulation of the indexes to information (rather-77) . libraries followed the paradigm of their catalogs and references by migrating the format and organization of their hardcopy information references into structured databases . these remain as a primary mechanism for researching sources of needed information and play a major role in available information-retrieval-systems . academic-research that was pursued through the 1980s was constrained by the paradigm of the indexed structure associated with libraries and the lack of computer power to handle large (gigabyte) text-databases . the military and other government entities have always had a requirement to store and search large textual-databases . as a result they began many independent developments of textual-information-retrieval systems . given the large quantities of data they needed to process , they pursued both research-and-development of specialized-hardware and unique software solutions incorporating commercial off the shelf (cots) products where possible . the government has been the major fending source of research into information-retrieval-systems . with the advent of inexpensive powerful personnel-computer processing systems and high-speed , large capacity secondary-storage products , it has become chapter commercially feasible to provide large textual-information databases for the average user . the introduction and exponential growth of the-internet along with its initial wais (wide-area information servers) capability and more recently advanced search servers (e.g. , infoseek , excite) has provided a new avenue for access to terabytes of information (over 800 million indexable pages lawrence-99 .) the algorithms and techniques to optimize the processing and access of large quantities of textual data were once the sole domain of segments of the government , a few industries , and academics . they have now become a needed capability for large quantities of the population with significant research-and-development being done by the private-sector . additionally the volumes of nontextual information are also becoming searchable using specialized-search capabilities . images across the-internet are searchable from many web-sites such as webseek , ditto.com , altavista/images . news organizations such as the bbc are processing the audio news they have produced and are making historical audio news searchable via the audio transcribed versions of the news . major video organizations such as disney are using video-indexing to assist in finding specific images in their previously produced videos to use in future videos or incorporate in advertising . with exponential growth of multi-media on the internet capabilities such as these are becoming common place . information-retrieval exploitation of multi-media is still in its infancy with significant theoretical and practical-knowledge missing .
