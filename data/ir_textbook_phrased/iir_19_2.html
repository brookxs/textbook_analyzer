web characteristics what about the substance of the text in web-pages ? the democratization of content-creation on the web meant a new level of granularity in opinion on virtually any subject . this meant that the-web contained truth , lies , contradictions and suppositions on a grand scale . this gives rise to the question : which web-pages does one trust ? in a simplistic approach , one might argue that some publishers are trustworthy and others not - begging the question of how a search-engine is to assign such a measure of trust to each website or web-page . in chapter 21 we will examine approaches to understanding this question . more subtly , there may be no universal , user-independent notion of trust ; a web-page whose contents are trustworthy to one user may not be so to another . in traditional (non-web) publishing this is not an issue : users self-select sources they find trustworthy . thus one reader may find the reporting of the new york times to be reliable , while another may prefer the wall-street-journal . but when a search-engine is the only viable means for a user to become aware of (let alone select) most content , this challenge becomes significant . while the question `` how big is the-web ? '' has no easy answer (see section 19.5) , the question `` how many web-pages are in a search-engine 's index '' is more precise , although , even this question has issues . by the end of 1995 , altavista reported that it had crawled and indexed approximately 30 million static web-pages . static web-pages are those whose content does not vary from one request for that page to the next . for this purpose , a professor who manually updates his home-page every week is considered to have a static web-page , but an airport 's flight status page is considered to be dynamic . dynamic-pages are typically mechanically generated by an application-server in response to a query to a database , as show in figure 19.1 . one sign of such a page is that the url has the character '' ? '' in it . since the number of static web-pages was believed to be doubling every few months in 1995 , early web-search-engines such as altavista had to constantly add hardware and bandwidth for crawling and indexing web-pages . a dynamically generated web page.the browser sends a request for flight information on flight aa129 to the-web application , that fetches the information from back-end databases then creates a dynamic-web page that it returns to the browser . subsections the-web graph spam
