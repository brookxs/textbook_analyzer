11.2 data-modeling as we have already remarked , the complex nature of multimedia-data may benefit from the use of dbms functions for data-representation and querying . however , the integration of multimedia-data in a traditional dbms is not an easy task . indeed , traditional dbmss are mainly targeted to support conventional data . multimedia-data is inherently different from conventional data . the main difference is that information about the content of multimedia-data are usually not encoded into attributes provided by the data schema (structured-data) . rather , text , image , video , and audio data are typically unstructured . therefore , specific methods to identify and represent content-features and semantic-structures of multimedia-data are needed . another distinguishing feature of multimedia-data is its large storage requirements . one single-image usually requires several kbytes of storage , whereas a single second of video can require several mbytes of storage . moreover , the content of multimedia-data is difficult to analyze and compare , in order to be actively used during query-processing . addressing data-modeling issues in the framework of multimedia-ir systems entails two main tasks . first , a data-model should be defined by which the user can specify the data to be stored into the system . such a data-model should have the ability of an integrated support for both conventional and multimedia-data types and should provide methods to analyze , retrieve , and query such data . second , the system should provide a model for the internal-representation of multimedia-data . the definition of such a model is crucial for the efficiency of query-processing . as far as the first aspect is concerned , a promising technology with respect to the modeling requirements of multimedia-data is the object-oriented one [89] . the richness of the data-model provided by oodbmss makes them more suitable than relational dbmss for modeling both multimedia-data types and their semantic-relationships . moreover , the concept of class can be naturally used to define ad-hoc-data types for multimedia-data in that a class is characterized by both a set of attributes and a set of operations that can be performed on these attributes . classes can , moreover , be related into inheritance hierarchies , thus allowing the definition of a multimedia class as a specialization of one or more superclasses . however , the performance of oodbms in terms of storage-techniques , query-processing , and transaction-management is not comparable to that of relational dbmss . another drawback of oodbms is that they are highly non-standard . indeed , even though a standard language has been defined by the object-database management group (odmg) , very few systems support it . for all the above reasons , a lot of effort lias been devoted to the extension of the relational-model with capabilities for modeling complex-objects , typical of the object-oriented context . the goal of the so-called object-relational technology is to extend the relational-model with the ability of representing complex-data-types by maintaining , at the same time , the performance and the simplicity of relational dbmss and related-query languages . the possibility of defining abstract-data-types inside the relational-model allows one to define ad-hoc-data types for multimedia-data . for instance , such data typ ** s ran provide support for data-modeling 329 content-dependent queries . in the following section , we will give some examples of such extensions . the second problem related to data-modeling is how multimedia-data are represented inside the system . due to the particular nature of multimedia-data , it is not sufbcient to describe it through a set of attributes as usually done with traditional data . rather , some information should be extracted from the objects and used during query-processing . the extracted information is typically represented as a set-of-features ; each multimedia-object is therefore internally represented as a list of features , each of which represents a point in a multidimensional-space . multi-at tribute access-methods can then be used to index and search for them (see chapter 12) . features can be assigned to multimedia objects either manually by the user , or automatically by the system . in general , a hybrid-approach is used , by which the system determines some of the values and the user corrects or augments them . in both cases , values assigned to some specific-features , such as the shape of an image or the style of an audio object , are assigned to the object by comparing the object with some previously classified objects . for instance , to establish whether an image represents a car or a house , the shape of the image is compared with the shapes of already classified cars and houses before taking a decision . finally , it is important to recall that feature-extraction can not be precise . therefore , a weight is usually assigned to each feature-value representing the uncertainty of assigning such a value to that feature . for example , if we are 80 % sure that a shape is a square , we can store this value together with the recognized shape . from the previous discussion , it follows that data-modeling in a multimedia-ir system is an articulated activity that must take into account both the complex structure of data and the need of representing features extracted from multimedia objects . in the following , we give a brief overview of some proposals to model multimedia-data . we start by reviewing the support for multimedia-data provided by commercial dbmss . then , as an example of a research proposal we survey the data-model developed in the context of the multos project .
