3.1.1 history indexing (originally called cataloging) is the oldest technique for identifying the contents of items to assist in their retrieval . the objective of cataloging is to give access-points to a collection that are expected and most useful to the users of the information . the basic information required on an item , what is the item and what it is about , has not changed over the centuries . as early as the third-millennium , in babylon , libraries of cuneiform tablets were arranged by subject (hyman-89) . up to the 19th century there was little advancement in cataloging , only changes in the methods used to represent the basic information (norris-69) . in the late 1800s subject-indexing became hierarchical (e.g. , dewey decimal system) . in 1963 the library-of-congress initiated a study on the computerization of bibliographic surrogates . from 1966 - 1968 the library-of-congress ran its marc i pilot project . marc (machine readable cataloging) standardizes the structure , contents and coding of bibliographic-records . the cataloging and indexing 53 system became operational in 1969 (avram-75) . the earliest commercial cataloging system is dialog , which was developed by lockheed corporation in 1965 for nasa . it became commercial in 1978 with three government files of indexes to technical publications . by 1988 , when it was sold to knight-ridder , dialog contained over 320 index databases used by over 91,000 subscribers in 86 countries (harper-81) . indexing (cataloging) , until recently , was accomplished by creating a bibliographic-citation in a structured file that references the original text . these files contain citation-information about the item , keywording the subject (s) of the item and , in some systems a constrained length free-text field used for an abstract/summary . the indexing process is typically performed by professional indexers associated with library organizations . throughout the history of libraries , this has been the most important and most difficult processing step . most items are retrieved based upon what the item is about . the user 's ability to find items on a particular subject is limited by the indexer creating index-terms for that subject . but libraries and library indexing have always assumed the availability of the library staff to act if needed as a human intermediary for users having problems in locating information . for users looking for well-defined data (e.g. , people by name and titles) have good success by themselves . but when users are searching for topics they fail on 70 % of single query requests and 45 % of the time in ever finding the data they need . but when the users consult with a librarian the failure-rates drop to 10 % (nordlie-99 .) thus library_based indexing was never under significant pressure to invent user-interfaces , support material and augmented search-engines that would assure users could find the material they needed . they could rely on human-interaction to resolve the more complex-information-needs . the initial introduction of computers to assist the cataloguing function did not change its basic operation of a human indexer determining those terms to assign to a particular item . the standardization of data-structures (e.g. , marc format) did allow sharing of the indexes between libraries . it reduced the manual overhead associated with maintaining a card catalog . by not having to make physical copies of the index card for every subject index term , it also encouraged inclusion of additional index-terms . but the process still required the indexer to enter index-terms that are redundant with the words in the referenced item . the user , instead of searching through physical cards in a card catalog , now performed a search on a computer and electronically displayed the card equivalents . in the 1990s , the significant reduction in cost of processing power and memory in modem computers , along with access to the full text of an item from the publishing stages in electronic-form , allow use of the full text of an item as an alternative to the indexer-generated subject index . the searchable availability of the text of items has changed the role of indexers and allowed introduction of new techniques to facilitate the user in locating information of interest . the indexer is no longer required to enter index-terms that are redundant with words in the text of an item . the searcher is no longer presented a list of potential item of interest , but is additionally informed of the likelihood that each item satisfies his search-goal .
