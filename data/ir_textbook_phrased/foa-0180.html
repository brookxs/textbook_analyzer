8.3.4 teachers and students `` finding out about '' describes an activity from the perspective of the searcher , someone actively educating him - or herself . note how similar activities like computer-aided-education and distance-learning are to foa . they too present many documents to a user/student toward a similar educational goal . the critical difference is who is `` driving '' the educational process : in most educational settings we expect there is a teacher present , and the onus of the educational dialog is on the teacher . in the semiotic terms of the last section , teachers and students (and sometimes authors and their readers) are involved in a special form of language game that might be called a tell/ask duality (see figure 8.6) . as author and reader , or teacher and student , become engaged in a conversation , they alternatively cede control of their shared attentional focus . a teacher explains by telling a story that takes some time to 314 finding out about figure 8.6 the tell/ask duality complete . some of these stories are relatively self-contained , but most are only pieces of much larger stories . there must be opportunities for students to ask questions in this exchange , even as these necessarily interrupt the flow of the story . another way to appreciate the value of this pedagogical structure is to consider what happens when it is removed : when a query is asked of a search-engine , the resulting hitlist is missing just this pedagogical structure . when trying to characterize what is most missing from hitlists , imagining a lecture that explains their relationships is one good characterization . our image of the classroom typically has a single teacher at the front and many , perhaps 30 , students remaining quiet to hear the lecture . the teacher has prepared readings and made these available (and maybe the students have even read them :-rrb- . the lecture is part of a larger curriculum , and the readings help to relate the current lecture to a larger question . it is likely that there are simultaneously other teachers in other educational institutions teaching similar courses . for example , the nsf has sponsored the construction of a repository for computer-science-curricula .15 in every subject , there are texts other than the one selected j 5 www . education , siggraph.org / nsfcscr/nsfcscr . home . html conclusions and future-directions 315 by a particular instructor . the student , especially the good student , may check out these other sources-of-information , but they must be on their guard to give special emphasis to those materials most likely to affect the grade they will ultimately receive from this teacher ! now consider the serious (in the sense that they are there to be informed , not entertained) www surfer . they have a question in mind and hope that somewhere on the www they will find their answer . their question is almost certainly much smaller than the question around which a course is defined . this surfer may choose , if he or she has many questions in a related area , to take the course , but the point is that one of the pieces of information this surfer may well see in his search is the curriculum for a course like the one just described . there are many important questions about just how curricular materials available via the www can and should be used . they range from intellectual-property issues (who owns them , the institution or the faculty ?) , to presentation media choices , to a reconsideration of exactly what is the importance of face-to-face meetings in the classroom . here we concentrate on the fundamental exchange of information : who is attempting to learn what ? in the class situation , the teacher is charged with presenting information that most efficiently allows these students to learn the concepts the instructor thinks are important . the surfer , on the other hand , is trying to make sense of the almost random set of documents in their hitlist . as weve discussed , if the browsing user really knew the answer of their information-need precisely , they would n't be surfing ! literate , intelligent surfers have remarkable skill at identifying documents that are likely to contain the answer to their question . in this sense they are both learner and teacher , trying to teach themselves . especially once they are beyond (compulsory , k-l 2) elementary-education , the www is an excellent place for active students to construct their education . there are choices to be made between educational institutions and then between teachers of the same class . students must pick a major discipline . then there may be graduate-school , and the process repeats itself . as the workforce becomes more involved in continuing-education , as distance-learning becomes more possible and fashionable , as lifelong-learning becomes a political objective , students will be actively seeking curricular units of all different sizes and scopes . many of these questions resolve ultimately in economic issues : how much is a master ^ 316 finding out about degree worth ? how much is tuition at two different schools ? how much larger a salary can i earn if i have a certain education ? these changes go hand in hand with the changing institutional pressures on public and private educational-systems . for example , corporations such as the educational testing service (ets) are being pressed to incorporate more holistic essay questions in place of easier-to-grade multiple-choice-questions . as a consequence , textual classification-techniques like those considered in section 7.4 are being used to explore algorithmic e-rater16 computer grading of ets essay questions [larkey , 1998a] ! from the publisher 's point-of-view , k-12-curricula are being divided into smaller curricular units . no longer is it necessary to buy an entire curriculum (grades k-6 , mathematics) and have it adopted in toto by a school board . state guidelines have many facets , and publishers can equate units to these facets at a very fine-grain of detail . local curricular goals and teacher preferences can help to assemble units taken from various publishers and assembled like beads on strings . for the entrepreneurial teacher this provides an excellent opportunity to write curricula themselves , because they are in an excellent position to suggest ways that topics can be connected to guidelines . as we build more and more autonomous-agents (cf. section 7.6) , this interplay between teacher and student (now both software entities !) must transform our notions of who is controlling the dialog to one of mixed initiatives . within the field of machine-learning , we typically make the assumption that the-learner is extremely passive . more recent analysis extends this to situations of active-learning , where a large part of the problem is how informative the exemplars selected can be so as to most quickly learn .
