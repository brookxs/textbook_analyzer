4 data-structure 4.1 introduction to data-structures 4.2 stemming algorithms 4.3 inverted-file structure 4.4 n-gram data-structure 4.5 pat data-structure 4.6 signature-file structure 4.7 hypertext and xml-data structures 4.8 hidden-markov-models 4.9 summary knowledge of data-structures used in information-retrieval-systems provides insights into the capabilities available to the systems that implement them . each data-structure has a set of associated capabilities that provide an insight into the objectives of the implementers by its selection . from an information-retrieval-system perspective , the two aspects of a data-structure that are important are its ability to represent concepts and their relationships and how well it supports location of those concepts . this chapter discusses the major logical data structures that are used in information-retrieval-systems . the implementation of a data-structure (e.g. , as an object , linked-list , array , hashed file) is discussed only as an example . a description of hidden-markov-models (hmms) is included in section 8 . hmms are starting to be used as a new approach for searching for information .
