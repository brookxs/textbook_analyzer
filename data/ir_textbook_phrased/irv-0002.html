the structure of the book the introduction presents some basic background material , demarcates the subject and discusses loosely some of the problems in ir . the chapters that follow cover topics in the order in which i would think about them were i about to design an experimental ir-system . they begin by describing the generation of machine representations for the information , and then move on to an explanation of the logical-structures that may be arrived at by clustering . there are numerous methods for representing these structures in the computer , or in other words , there is a choice of file-structures to represent the logical-structure , so these are outlined next . once the information has been stored in this way we are able to search it , hence a discussion of search-strategies follows . the chapter on probabilistic-retrieval is an attempt to create a formal-model for certain kinds of search-strategies . lastly , in an experimental situation all of the above will have been futile unless the results of retrieval can be evaluated . therefore a large chapter is devoted to ways of measuring the effectiveness of retrieval . in the final chapter i have indulged in a little speculation about the possibilities for ir in the next decade . the two major chapters are those dealing with automatic-classification and evaluation . i have tried to write them in such a way that each can be read independently of the rest of the book (although i do not recommend this for the non-specialist) .
