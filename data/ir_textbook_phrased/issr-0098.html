7.2 similarity-measures and ranking searching in general is concerned with calculating the similarity between a user 's search statement and the items in the database . although many of the older systems are unweighted , the newer classes of information-retrieval-systems have logically stored weighted values for the indexes to an item . the similarity may be applied to the total item or constrained to logical passages in the item . for example , every paragraph may be defined as a passage or every 100 words . the pircs system from queen 's college , cuny , applies its algorithms to subdocuments defined as 550 word chunks (kwok-96 , kwok-95) . in this case , the similarity will be to the passages versus the total item . rather limiting the definition of a passage to a fixed length size , locality_based similarity allows variable-length passages (neighborhoods) based upon similarity of content (kretser-99) . this then leads to the ability to define locality based searching and retrieval of the precise locations of information that satisfies the query . the highest similarity for any of the passages is used as the similarity-measure for the item . restricting the similarity-measure to passages gains significant precision with minimal impact on recall . in results presented at trec-4 , it was discovered that passage-retrieval makes a significant difference when search statements are long (hundreds of terms) but does not make a major difference for short queries . the lack of a large number of terms makes it harder to find shorter passages that contain the search-terms expanded from the shorter queries . 168 chapter 7 once items are identified as possibly relevant to the user 's query , it is best to present the most likely relevant items first . this process is called `` ranking . '' usually the output of the use of a similarity-measure in the search-process is a scalar number that represents how similar an item is to the query .
