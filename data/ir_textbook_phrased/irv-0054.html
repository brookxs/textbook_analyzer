cluster-based-retrieval cluster-based-retrieval has as its foundation the cluster-hypothesis , which states that closely associated documents tend to be relevant to the same requests . clustering picks out closely associated documents and groups them together into one cluster . in chapter 3 , i discussed many ways of doing this , here i shall ignore the actual mechanism of generating the classification and concentrate on how it may be searched with the aim of retrieving relevant documents . suppose we have a hierarchic classification of documents then a simple search-strategy goes as follows (refer to figure 5.3 for details) . the search starts at the root of the tree , node 0 in the example . it proceeds by evaluating a matching-function at the nodes immediately descendant from node 0 , in the example the nodes 1 and 2 . this pattern repeats itself down the tree . the search is directed by a decision-rule , which on the basis of comparing the values of a matching-function at each stage decides which node to expand further . also , it is necessary to have a stopping rule which terminates the search and forces a retrieval . in figure 5.3 the decision-rule is : expand the node corresponding to the maximum value of the matching-function achieved within a filial set . the stopping rule is : stop if the current maximum is less than the previous maximum . a few remarks about this strategy are in order : (1) we assume that effective retrieval can be achieved by finding just one cluster ; (2) we assume that each cluster can be adequately represented by a cluster represent - ative for the purpose of locating the cluster containing the relevant documents ; (3) if the maximum of the matching-function is not unique some special action , such as a look-ahead , will need to be taken ; (4) the search always terminates and will retrieve at least one document . an immediate generalisation of this search is to allow the search to proceed down more than one branch of the tree so as to allow retrieval of more than one cluster . by necessity the decision-rule and stopping rule will be slightly more complicated . the main difference being that provision must be made for back-tracking . this will occur when the search-strategy estimates (based on the current value of the matching-function) that further progress down a branch is a waste of time , at which point it may or may not retrieve the current cluster . the search then returns (back-tracks) to a previous branching point and takes an alternative branch down the tree . the above strategies may be described as top-down searches . a bottom-up search is one which enters the tree at one of its terminal nodes , and proceeds in an upward direction towards the root of the tree . in this way it will pass through a sequence of nested clusters of increasing size . a decision-rule is not required ; we only need a stopping rule which could be simply a cut-off . a typical search would seek the largest cluster containing the document represented by the starting node and not exceeding the cut-off in size . once this cluster is found , the set of documents in it is retrieved . to initiate the search in response to a request it is necessary to know in advance one terminal node appropriate for that request . it is not unusual to find that a user will already known of a document relevant to his request and is seeking other documents similar to it . this ` source ' document can thus be used to initiate a bottom-up search . for a systematic evaluation of bottom-up searches in terms of efficiency-and-effectiveness see croft [7] . if we now abandon the idea of having a multi-level clustering and accept a single-level clustering , we end up with the approach to document-clustering which salton and his co-workers have worked on extensively . the appropriate cluster method is typified by rocchio 's algorithm described in chapter 3 . the search-strategy is in part a serial-search . it proceeds by first finding the best (or nearest) cluster (s) and then looking within these . the second stage is achieved by doing a serial-search of the documents in the selected cluster (s) . the output is frequently a ranking of the documents so retrieved .
