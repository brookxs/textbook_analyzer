(2006) the structured-document-retrieval principle is due to chiaramella et al. (1996) . figure 10.5 is from (fuhr and großjohann , 2004) . rahm and bernstein (2001) give a survey of automatic schema matching that is applicable to xml . the vector-space based xml-retrieval method in section 10.3 is essentially ibm haifa 's juruxml system as presented by mass et al. (2003) and carmel et al. (2003) . schlieder and meuss (2002) and grabs and schek (2002) describe similar approaches . carmel et al. (2003) represent queries as xml-fragments . the trees that represent xml-queries in this chapter are all xml-fragments , but xml-fragments also permit the operators , and phrase on content nodes . we chose to present the vector-space-model for xml-retrieval because it is simple and a natural extension of the unstructured vector-space-model in chapter 6 . but many other unstructured retrieval-methods have been applied to xml-retrieval with at least as much success as the vector-space-model . these methods include language-models (cf. chapter 12 , e.g. , kamps et al. (2004) , ogilvie and callan (2005) , list et al. (2005)) , systems that use a relational-database as a backend (theobald et al. , 2008 ; 2005 , mihajlovic et al. , 2005) , probabilistic weighting (lu et al. , 2007) , and fusion (larson , 2005) . there is currently no consensus as to what the best approach to xml-retrieval is . most early work on xml-retrieval accomplished relevance-ranking by focusing on individual terms , including their structural contexts , in query and document . as in unstructured-information retrieval , there is a trend in more recent work to model relevance-ranking as combining evidence from disparate measurements about the query , the document and their match . the combination function can be tuned manually (sigurbjörnsson et al. , 2004 , arvola et al. , 2005) or trained using machine-learning-methods (vittaut and gallinari (2006) , cf. mls) . an active area of xml-retrieval research is focused-retrieval (trotman et al. , 2007) , which aims to avoid returning nested elements that share one or more common subelements (cf. discussion in section 10.2 , page 10.2) . there is evidence that users dislike redundancy caused by nested elements (betsi et al. , 2006) . focused-retrieval requires evaluation-measures that penalize redundant results lists (kazai and lalmas , 2006 , lalmas et al. , 2007) . trotman and geva (2006) argue that xml-retrieval is a form of passage-retrieval . in passage-retrieval (kaszkiel and zobel , 1997 , salton et al. , 1993 , hearst and plaunt , 1993 , hearst , 1997 , zobel et al. , 1995) , the retrieval-system returns short passages instead of documents in response to a user-query . while element boundaries in xml-documents are cues for identifying good segment-boundaries between passages , the most relevant passage often does not coincide with an xml element . in the last several years , the query format at inex has been the nexi standard proposed by trotman and sigurbjörnsson (2004) . figure 10.3 is from their paper . o'keefe and trotman (2004) give evidence that users can not reliably distinguish the child and descendant axes . this justifies only permitting descendant axes in nexi (and xml-fragments) . these structural constraints were only treated as `` hints '' in recent inexes . assessors can judge an element highly relevant even though it violates one of the structural constraints specified in a nexi query . an alternative to structured-query languages like nexi is a more sophisticated user-interface for query-formulation (tannier and geva , 2005 , van zwol , 2006 , woodley and geva , 2006) . a broad overview of xml-retrieval that covers database as well as ir approaches is given by amer-yahia and lalmas (2006) and an extensive reference list on the topic can be found in (amer-yahia et al. , 2005) . chapter 6 of grossman and frieder (2004) is a good introduction to structured-text retrieval from a database perspective . the proposed standard for xquery is available at http://www.w3.org/tr/xquery/ including an extension for full-text queries (amer-yahia et al. , 2006) : http://www.w3.org/tr/xquery-full-text/ . work that has looked at combining the relational-database and the unstructured-information retrieval approaches includes (fuhr and rölleke , 1997) , (navarro and baeza-yates , 1997) , (cohen , 1998) , and (chaudhuri et al. , 2006) .
