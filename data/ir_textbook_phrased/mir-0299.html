15.4.6 access when priceless objects are described by digital-library image-collections [300] , when collections are large and/or well organized so as to appear of value to communities of users , or when there are valuable services in information-manipulation (searching , ordering , reporting , summarizing , etc.) afforded by a-digital library , some method prototypes , projects , and interfaces 425 of payment is often required [194 , 191 , 49 , 251] . though previously access to scientific-literature was not viewed as a commodity as it is today [328] , digital librarys clearly must manage intellectual-property [559] . these services must support agreed-upon principles [586] , copyright practices [705] , as well as contracts and other agreements and laws [346] . though technology is only part of the picture [822] , a key to the implementation of policies for access-management [30] is having trusted-systems [746] . security is one topic often ignored by the ir community . however , many aspects of security can be of fundamental importance in digital librarys [302 , 301] . just as encryption is essential to support electronic-commerce , watermarking and stronger mechanisms are crucial in digital librarys to protect intellectual-property-rights and to control the types of access afforded to different user-groups . scenarios are important here , to ensure that suitable constraints are imposed on processing , all the way from input to output . for example , secret documents may not even be made visible in searches through metadata . on the other hand , advertising full documents as well as allowing locating and viewing metadata records is appropriate when the purpose of security is to enforce payment in ; pay by the drink ' document downloading systems . inference-systems can be used for complicated rights-management situations [16] . a deeper understanding of these requirements and services can be obtained by considering representative digital-library projects , such as those mentioned in the next section .
