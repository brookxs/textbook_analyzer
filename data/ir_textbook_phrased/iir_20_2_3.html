the url-frontier the second consideration is politeness : we must avoid repeated fetch requests to a host within a short time span . the likelihood of this is exacerbated because of a form of locality-of-reference : many urls link to other urls at the same host . as a result , a url-frontier implemented as a simple priority-queue might result in a burst of fetch requests to a host . this might occur even if we were to constrain the crawler so that at most one thread could fetch from any single host at any time . a common heuristic is to insert a gap between successive fetch requests to a host that is an order of magnitude larger than the time taken for the most recent fetch from that host . figure 20.3 shows a polite and prioritizing implementation of a url-frontier . its goals are to ensure that (i) only one connection is open at a time to any host ; (ii) a waiting time of a few seconds occurs between successive requests to a host and (iii) high-priority pages are crawled preferentially . the two major sub-modules are a set of front queues in the upper portion of the figure , and a set of back queues in the lower part ; all of these are fifo-queues . the front queues implement the prioritization , while the back queues implement politeness . in the flow of a url added to the frontier as it makes its way through the front and back queues , a prioritizer first assigns to the url an integer priority between 1 and based on its fetch history (taking into account the rate at which the-web page at this url has changed between previous crawls) . for instance , a document that has exhibited frequent change would be assigned a higher priority . other heuristics could be application-dependent and explicit - for instance , urls from news-services may always be assigned the highest priority . now that it has been assigned priority , the url is now appended to the th of the front queues . each of the back queues maintains the following invariants : (i) it is non-empty while the crawl is in progress and (ii) it only contains urls from a single host . an auxiliary table (figure 20.4) is used to maintain the mapping from hosts to back queues . whenever a back-queue is empty and is being re-filled from a front-queue , table must be updated accordingly . in addition , we maintain a heap with one entry for each back queue , the entry being the earliest time at which the host corresponding to that queue can be contacted again . figure 20.4 : example of an auxiliary hosts-to-back queues table . a crawler thread requesting a url from the frontier extracts the root of this heap and (if necessary) waits until the corresponding time entry . it then takes the url at the head of the back queue corresponding to the extracted heap root , and proceeds to fetch the url . after fetching , the calling thread checks whether is empty . if so , it picks a front queue and extracts from its head a url . the choice of front queue is biased (usually by a random-process) towards queues of higher priority , ensuring that urls of high priority flow more quickly into the back queues . we examine to check whether there is already a back queue holding urls from its host . if so , is added to that queue and we reach back to the front queues to find another candidate url for insertion into the now-empty queue . this process continues until is non-empty again . in any case , the thread inserts a heap entry for with a new earliest time based on the properties of the url in that was last fetched (such as when its host was last contacted as well as the time taken for the last fetch) , then continues with its processing . for instance , the new entry could be the current time plus ten times the last fetch time . the number of front queues , together with the policy of assigning priorities and picking queues , determines the priority properties we wish to build into the system . the number of back queues governs the extent to which we can keep all crawl threads busy while respecting politeness . the designers of mercator recommend a rough rule of three times as many back queues as crawler threads . on a web-scale crawl , the url-frontier may grow to the point where it demands more memory at a node than is available . the solution is to let most of the url-frontier reside on disk . a portion of each queue is kept in memory , with more brought in from disk as it is drained in memory . exercises . why is it better to partition hosts (rather than individual urls) between the nodes of a distributed crawl system ? why should the host splitter precede the duplicate url eliminator ? in the preceding discussion we encountered two recommended `` hard constants '' - the increment on being ten times the last fetch time , and the number of back queues being three times the number of crawl threads . how are these two constants related ?
