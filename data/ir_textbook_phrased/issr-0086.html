6 document and term-clustering 6.1 introduction to clustering 6.2 thesaurus-generation 6.3 item clustering 6.4 hierarchy of clusters 6.5 summary chapter 5 introduced indexing associated with representation of the semantics of an item . in all of the techniques discussed in chapter 5 , our information database can be viewed as being composed of a number of independent items indexed by a series of index-terms . this model lends itself to two types of clustering : clustering index-terms to create a statistical thesaurus and clustering items to create document clusters . in the first case-clustering is used to increase recall by expanding searches with related terms . in document-clustering the search can retrieve items similar to an item of interest , even if the query would not have retrieved the item . the clustering process is not precise and care must be taken on use of clustering-techniques to minimize the negative impact misuse can have . these issues are discussed in section 6.1 along with some general guidelines of clustering . section 6.2 discusses a variety of specific techniques to create thesaurus clusters . the techniques can be categorized as those that use the complete database to perform the clustering and those that start with some initial structure . section 6.3 looks at the same techniques as they apply to item (document) clustering . a class of clustering-algorithms creates a hierarchical output . the hierarchy of clusters usually reflects more abstract-concepts in the higher levels and more detailed specific items in the lower levels . given the large-data-sets in information-retrieval-systems , it is essential to optimize the clustering process in terms of time and required processing power . hierarchical-clustering and its associated performance-improvements are described in section 6.4 .
