topic-specific pagerank non-uniformly suppose our random surfer , endowed with a teleport operation as before , teleports to a random web-page on the topic of sports instead of teleporting to a uniformly chosen random web-page . we will not focus on how we collect all web-pages on the topic of sports ; in fact , we only need a non-zero subset of sports-related web-pages , so that the teleport operation is feasible . this may be obtained , for instance , from a manually built directory of sports pages such as the open-directory-project (http://www.dmoz.org/) or that of yahoo . provided the set of sports-related pages is non-empty , it follows that there is a non-empty set of web-pages over which the random-walk has a steady-state distribution ; let us denote this sports pagerank-distribution by . for web-pages not in , we set the pagerank values to zero . we call the topic-specific pagerank for sports . topic-specific pagerank.in this example we consider a user whose interests are 60 % sports and 40 % politics . if the teleportation probability is 10 % , this user is modeled as teleporting 6 % to sports pages and 4 % to politics pages . we do not demand that teleporting takes the random surfer to a uniformly chosen sports page ; the distribution over teleporting targets could in fact be arbitrary . in like manner we can envision topic-specific pagerank distributions for each of several topics such as science , religion , politics and so on . each of these distributions assigns to each web-page a pagerank value in the interval . for a user interested in only a single topic from among these topics , we may invoke the corresponding pagerank-distribution when scoring-and-ranking search-results . this gives us the potential of considering settings in which the search-engine knows what topic a user is interested in . this may happen because users either explicitly register their interests , or because the system learns by observing each user 's behavior over time . but what if a user is known to have a mixture of interests from multiple topics ? for instance , a user may have an interest mixture (or profile) that is 60 % sports and 40 % politics ; can we compute a personalized-pagerank for this user ? at first glance , this appears daunting : how could we possibly compute a different pagerank-distribution for each user-profile (with , potentially , infinitely many possible profiles) ? we can in fact address this provided we assume that an individual 's interests can be well-approximated as a linear combination of a small number of topic page distributions . a user with this mixture of interests could teleport as follows : determine first whether to teleport to the set of known sports pages , or to the set of known politics pages . this choice is made at random , choosing sports pages 60 % of the time and politics pages 40 % of the time . once we choose that a particular teleport step is to (say) a random sports page , we choose a web-page in uniformly at random to teleport to . this in turn leads to an ergodic markov-chain with a steady-state distribution that is personalized to this user 's preferences over topics (see exercise 21.2.3) . while this idea has intuitive appeal , its implementation appears cumbersome : it seems to demand that for each user , we compute a transition-probability matrix and compute its steady-state distribution . we are rescued by the fact that the evolution of the probability-distribution over the states of a markov-chain can be viewed as a linear system . in exercise 21.2.3 we will show that it is not necessary to compute a pagerank vector for every distinct combination of user-interests over topics ; the personalized-pagerank vector for any user can be expressed as a linear combination of the underlying topic-specific pageranks . for instance , the personalized-pagerank vector for the user whose interests are 60 % sports and 40 % politics can be computed as (261) exercises . write down the transition-probability matrix for the example in figure 21.2 . consider a web-graph with three nodes 1 , 2 and 3 . the links are as follows : . write down the transition-probability matrices for the surfer 's walk with teleporting , for the following three values of the teleport probability : (a) ; (b) and (c) . a user of a browser can , in addition to clicking a hyperlink on the page he is currently browsing , use the back-button to go back to the page from which he arrived at . can such a user of back buttons be modeled as a markov-chain ? how would we model repeated invocations of the back-button ? consider a markov-chain with three states a , b and c , and transition-probabilities as follows . from state a , the next state is b with probability 1 . from b , the next state is either a with probability , or state c with probability . from c the next state is a with probability 1 . for what values of is this markov-chain ergodic ? show that for any directed-graph , the markov chain induced by a random-walk with the teleport operation is ergodic . show that the pagerank of every page is at least . what does this imply about the difference in pagerank values (over the various pages) as becomes close to 1 ? for the data in example 21.2.2 , write a small routine or use a scientific calculator to compute the pagerank values stated in equation 260 . suppose that the-web graph is stored on disk as an adjacency list , in such a way that you may only query for the out-neighbors of pages in the order in which they are stored . you can not load the graph in main-memory but you may do multiple reads over the full graph . write the algorithm for computing the pagerank in this setting . recall the sets and introduced near the beginning of section 21.2.3 . how does the set relate to ? is the set always the set of all web-pages ? why or why not ? is the sports pagerank of any page in at least as large as its pagerank ? consider a setting where we have two topic-specific pagerank values for each web-page : a sports pagerank , and a politics pagerank . let be the (common) teleportation probability used in computing both sets of topic-specific pageranks . for , consider a user whose interest profile is divided between a fraction in sports and a fraction in politics . show that the user 's personalized-pagerank is the steady-state distribution of a random-walk in which - on a teleport step - the walk teleports to a sports page with probability and to a politics page with probability . show that the markov chain corresponding to the walk in exercise 21.2.3 is ergodic and hence the user 's personalized-pagerank can be obtained by computing the steady-state distribution of this markov-chain . show that in the steady-state distribution of exercise 21.2.3 , the steady-state probability for any web-page equals .
