32 chapter 2 2.1.4 fuzzy searches fuzzy searches provide the capability to locate spellings of words that are similar to the entered search-term . this function is primarily used to compensate for errors in spelling of words . fuzzy searching increases recall at the expense of decreasing precision (i.e. , it can erroneously identify terms as the search-term) . in the process of expanding a query-term fuzzy searching includes other terms that have similar spellings , giving more weight (in systems that rank output) to words in the database that have similar word lengths and position of the characters as the entered term . a fuzzy-search on the term `` computer '' would automatically include the following words from the information database : `` computer , '' `` compiler , '' `` conputer , '' `` computter , '' `` compute . '' an additional enhancement may lookup the proposed alternative spelling and if it is a valid word with a different meaning , include it in the search with a low ranking or not include it at all (e.g. , `` commuter '') . systems allow the specification of the maximum number of new terms that the expansion includes in the query . in this case the alternate spellings that are `` closest '' to the query-term is included . `` closest '' is a heuristic function that is system specific . fuzzy searching has its maximum utilization in systems that accept items that have been optical character read (ocred) . in the ocr process a hardcopy item is scanned into a binary-image (usually at a resolution of 300 dots per inch or more) . the ocr process is a pattern-recognition process that segments the scanned in image into meaningful subregions , often considering a segment the area defining a single-character . the ocr process will then determine the character and translate it to an internal computer encoding (e.g. , ascii or some other standard for other than latin based languages) . based upon the original quality of the hardcopy this process introduces errors in recognizing characters . with decent quality input , systems achieves in the 90 - 99 per cent range of accuracy . since these are character errors throughout the text , fuzzy searching allows location of items of interest compensating for the erroneous characters .
