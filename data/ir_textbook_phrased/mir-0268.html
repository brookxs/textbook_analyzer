13.7.3 teaching the user-interfaces are slowly improving in assisting the user with the task of acquiring a better grasp of what web-pages are being retrieved . query-forms must specify clearly if one or all the words must be in a page , which words should not be in a page , etc. , without using a written boolean-query language . second , users should try to give as many terms as possible , in particular terms that must be or should not be in the pages . in particular , a user should include all possible synonyms of a word . if the user can restrict the search to a field (for example , the page title) or limit some attribute (date , country) , this will certainly reduce the size of the answer . in case of doubt , the user should remember to look at the help information provided by the search-engine . if he can not find where one of the relevant terms is in a page , he can use the find option of the browser . even if we are able to pose a good query , the answer can still be quite large . considering that the visual-tools mentioned before are not yet available for the general public , the user must learn from experience . there are many strategies for quickly finding relevant answers . if the user is looking for an institution , he can always try to guess the corresponding url by using the www prefix followed by a guessed institution acronym or brief name and ending with a top level domain (country code or com , edu , org , gov for the us) . if this does not work , the user can search the institution name in a web-directory . if we are looking for work related to a specific topic , a possible strategy is : (1) select an article relevant to the topic , if possible with non-common author surnames or title keywords (if it is not available , try any bibliographic database or a web-directory search for a first reference) ; and (2) use a search-engine to find all web-pages that have all those surnames and keywords . many of the results are likely to be relevant , because we can find : (a) newer papers that reference the initial reference , (b) personal-web pages of the authors , and most important , (c) pages about the topic that already contain many relevant references . this strategy can be iterated by changing the reference used as better references appear during the search . as mentioned at the beginning of this chapter , the-web poses so many problems , that it is easier and more effective to teach the user how to properly profit from search-engines and web-directories , rather than trying to guess what the user really wants . given that the coverage of the search-engines is low , use several engines or a metasearcher . also , remember that you have to evaluate the quality of each answer , even if it appears to be relevant . remember that anybody can publish in the web , and that does not mean that the data is correct or still valid . the lessons-learned in the examples shown above are : (1) search-engines still return too much hay together with the needle : and (2) web-directories do not have enough depth to find the needle . so , we can use the following rules of thumb : 392 searching the-web æ specific queries look in an encyclopedia , that is the reason that they exist . in other words , do not forget libraries . æ broad queries use web-directories to find good starting-points . ï vague-queries use web-search-engines and improve the query-formulation based on relevant answers .
