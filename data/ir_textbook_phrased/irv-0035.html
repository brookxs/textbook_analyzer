a language for describing file-structures like all subjects in computer-science the terminology of file-structures has evolved higgledy-piggledy without much concern for consistency , ambiguity , or whether it was possible to make the kind of distinctions that were important . it was only much later that the need for a well-defined , unambiguous language to describe file-structures became apparent . in particular , there arose a need to communicate ideas about file-structures without getting bogged down by hardware considerations . this section will present a formal-description of file-structures . the framework described is important for the understanding of any file-structure . the terminology is based on that introduced by hsiao and harary (but also see hsiao [15] and manola and hsiao [16]) . their terminology has been modified and extended by severance [17] , a summary of this can be found in van rijsbergen [18] . jonkers [19] has formalised a different framework which provides an interesting contrast to the one described here .
