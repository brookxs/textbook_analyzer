5.5.7 bayesian-networks as will be discussed in great detail in chapter 6 , there are many types of information on which we might wish to base our retrieval . most of this 176 finding out about figure 5.7 interaction between parental influences section has concerned probabilistic-models for the crucial index relation between keywords and documents , but we may wish to model other information probabilistically as well . bayesian-networks (also known as inference or belief-networks) are a modeling-language within which many probabilistic relationships can be expressed as part of a common representation and used as part of a unified inference procedure [pearl , 1988] . a bayesian-network is a graph in which nodes correspond to propositions and links correspond to conditional probabilistic-dependencies between these propositions . a directed link from node p to node q is used to model the fact that p causes qgt ; although other semantics (e.g. , logical implication) are sometimes also used . when representing interactions among n propositions , we must generally consider the possible dependency of each proposition on every other . to do this completely requires an exponential number of statistics , which is impractical for most situations and certainly if we attempt to model interactions between all the documents in our corpora and their keywords . within bayesian-networks , this full set of statistics - the joint-probability-distribution - is replaced by a sparse-representation only among those variables directly influencing one another . interactions among indirectly related variables are then computed by propagating inference through a graph of these direct connections . the key integration of probabilistic-information across interacting variables is accomplished by specifying how each child node depends on the set of its parents ' values . a table of conditional-dependency probabilities specifies , for each possible value of each parent node , the probability of each of the child variable 's value ; see figure 5.7 . with these condiditional relationships specified for each node * querying a bayesian-network corresponds to placing prior-probabilities on some elements of the network and then asking for the probability at other nodes . one of the most comprehensive applications of bayesian-network representations to the propositions associated with foa is due to croft mathematical foundations 177 figure 5.8 bayesian-network representation for foa with turtle and other students [turtle , 1990 ; turtle and croft , 1990 ; turtle and croft , 1991 ; turtle and croft , 1992 ; callan et al. , 1995] and is shown in figure 5.8 . this graph shows four types of nodes : documents , keywords , queries , and a single information-need node . ^ this graph is rooted on the document nodes . to use this representation , a single-document is `` instantiated , '' meaning that we posit that only this one document is retrieved and we ask for the probability that the information-need is satisfied . given these estimates for each document , the hitlist is formed according to the-probability-ranking-principle . estimates for the keywords ' dependencies on documents rely on the same weighting techniques discussed in section 3.3 . fuhr and buckley have extended this formalism to include an additional level , which they call relevance description / (Ã¯) [fuhr and buckley , 1991] . this is an arbitrary function over terms and documents x (k , d) . using this descriptive layer , rather than computing pr {rel \ ky d) the probability of relevance given a particular keyword and a particular document , they propose to evaluate pr {rel \ xihd)) where this is the `` probability that a document will be judged relevant to an arbitrary-query , given that one of the document 's index-terms * which multiple-representations of the same document 178 finding out about figure 5.9 concept-matching version of bayesian-network also occurs in the query , has the relevance description x '' fuhr argues that by separating the description function from the keyword and the document , a wider range of descriptions can be considered , and there is no longer a need to associate a probability-of-relevance with individual keywords or documents . an alternative formulation proposed by ribeiro and muntz , following work by wong and yao , imagines the keyword vocabulary describing a universe of discourse [ribeiro , 1995 ; ribeiro and muntz , 1996 ; wong and yao , 1995] , as shown in figure 5.9 . treating each keyword as a binary variable , any of the 2v possible subsets corresponds to a concept ; any query and every document can be described as a concept within this space . the goal of retrieval becomes one of conceptual-matching of a query against that of the documents . either pr (d | q) or pr (q | d) can be used to reflect the strength of the concept-matching relationship . in fact , these two quantities can generally be made equivalent with proper normalization [wong and yao , 1995] . note that the bayesian-network generated from this perspective inverts the causal links from those proposed by turtle and croft ! riberiro and muntz argue that their formulation is superior , because it treats queries and documents symmetrically (as we would expect for a concept-matching retrieval) . further , the fact that conventional cosine-similarity matching requires normalization of the document vector over all index-terms creates a dependence on terms not contained in the query . any such dependence violates a fundamental condition for bayesian-network graphs [pearl , 1988] . a good example of modeling within the bayesian-network formalism is to show how multiple-query-formulations , for example , boolean and mathematical foundations 179 cd (information and retrieval) or (- satellite) information-retrieval b information-retrieval figure 5.10 two examples of query-modeling weighted vector-space query strategies , can be modeled interchangeably . figure 5.10 shows in detail two possible ways in which query nodes might be connected to particular keywords . the jfirst shows a boolean-combination of keywords , and the second shows a network capturing dependencies between a phrase keyword and its constituent elements . interaction among multiple-queries all designed to satisfy the same information-need , as discussed in terms of a query-session in section 4.2 , can also be modeled .
