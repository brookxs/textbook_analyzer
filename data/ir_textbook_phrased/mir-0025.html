2.3 retrieval : ad-hoc and filtering in a conventional information-retrieval-system , the documents in the collection remain relatively static while new queries are submitted to the system . this operational mode has been termed ad-hoc-retrieval in recent years and is the 22 modeling most common form of user task . a similar but distinct task is one in which the queries remain relatively static while new documents come into the system (and leave) . for instance , this is the case with the stock-market and with news wiring services . this operational mode has been termed filtering . in a filtering task [74] , a user-profile describing the user 's preferences is constructed . such a profile is then compared to the incoming documents in an attempt to determine those which might be of interest to this particular user . for instance , this approach can be used to select a news article among thousands of articles which are broadcast each day . other potential scenarios for the application of filtering include the selection of preferred judicial decisions , or the selection of articles from daily newspapers , etc. . typically , the filtering task simply indicates to the user the documents which might be of interest to him . the task of determining which ones are really relevant is fully reserved to the user . not even a ranking of the filtered documents is provided . a variation of this procedure is to rank the filtered documents and show this ranking to the user . the motivation is that the user can examine a smaller number of documents if he assumes that the ones at the top of this ranking are more likely to be relevant . this variation of filtering is called routing (see chapter 3) but it is not popular . even if no ranking is presented to the user , the filtering task can compute an internal ranking to determine potentially relevant documents . for instance , documents with a ranking above a given threshold could be selected ; the others would be discarded . any ir model can be adopted to rank the documents , but the vector-model is usually preferred due to its simplicity . at this point , we observe that filtering is really a type of user task (or operational mode) and not a model of information-retrieval . thus , the task of filtering and the ir model adopted are orthogonal aspects of an ir-system . in a filtering task , the crucial step is not the ranking itself but the construction of a user-profile which truly reflects the user 's preferences . many approaches for constructing user-profiles have been proposed and here we briefly discuss a couple of them . a simplistic approach for constructing a user-profile is to describe the profile through a set of keywords and to require the user to provide the necessary keywords . the approach is simplistic because it requires the user to do too much . in fact , if the user is not familiar with the service which generates the upcoming documents , he might find it fairly difficult to provide the keywords which appropriately describe his preferences in that context . furthermore , an attempt by the user to familiarize himself with the vocabulary of the upcoming documents might turn into a tedious and time consuming exercise . thus , despite its feasibility , requiring the user to precisely describe his profile might be impractical . a more elaborate alternative is to collect information from the user about his preferences and to use this information to build the user-profile dynamically . this can be accomplished as follows . in the very beginning , the user provides a set of keywords which describe an initial (and primitive) profile of his preferences . as new documents arrive , the system uses this profile to select documents which are potentially of interest and a formal characterization of ir-models 23 shows them to the user . the user then goes through a relevance-feedback cycle (see chapter 5) in which he indicates not only the documents which are really relevant but also the documents which are non-relevant . the system uses this information to adjust the user-profile description such that it reflects the new preferences just declared . of course , with this procedure the profile is continually changing . hopefully , however , it stabilizes after a while and no longer changes drastically (unless , of course , the user 's interests shift suddenly) . chapter 5 illustrates mechanisms which can be used to dynamically update a keyword-based profile . prom the above , it should be clear that the filtering task can be viewed as a conventional information-retrieval-task in which the documents are the ones which keep arriving at the system . ranking can be computed as before . the difficulty with filtering resides in describing appropriately the user 's preferences in a user-profile . the most common approaches for deriving a user-profile are based on collecting relevant-information from the user , deriving preferences from this information , and modifying the user-profile accordingly . since the number of potential applications of filtering keeps increasing , we should see in the future a renewed interest in the study and usage of the technique .
