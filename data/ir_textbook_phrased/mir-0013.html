1.3.4 practical issues electronic-commerce is a major trend on the web nowadays and one which has benefited millions of people . in an electronic transaction , the buyer usually has to submit to the vendor some form of credit information which can be used for charging for the product or service . in its most common form , such information consists of a credit-card number . however , since transmitting credit-card numbers over the-internet is not a safe procedure , such data is usually transmitted over a fax line . this implies that , at least in the beginning , the transaction between a new-user and a vendor requires executing an off-line procedure of several steps before the actual transaction can take place . this situation can be improved if the data is encrypted for security . in fact , some institutions and companies already provide some form of encryption or automatic authentication for security reasons . however , security is not the only concern . another issue of major interest is privacy . frequently , people are willing to exchange information as long as it does not become public . the reasons are many but the most common one is to protect oneself against misuse of private-information by third parties . thus , privacy is another issue which affects the deployment of the-web and which has not been properly addressed yet . two other very important issues are copyright and patent rights . it is far the retrieval-process 9 from clear how the wide spread of data on the web affects copyright and patent laws in the various countries . this is important because it affects the business of building up and deploying large digital-libraries . for instance , is a site which supervises all the information it posts acting as a publisher ? and if so , is it responsible for a misuse of the information it posts (even if it is not the source) ? additionally , other practical issues of interest include scanning , optical-character-recognition (ocr) , and cross-language-retrieval (in which the query is in one language but the documents retrieved are in another language) . in this book , however , we do not cover practical issues in detail because it is not our main focus . the reader interested in details of practical issues is referred to the interesting book by lesk [501] .
