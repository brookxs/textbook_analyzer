2.4 example corpora in these experiments , and the rest that follow , we will consistently use two example corpora . the first of these we will call the `` artificial-intelligence thesis '' (ait) corpus . this is approximately 5000 ph.d. and master 's dissertations and abstracts . virtually every dissertation published within the last 30 years extracting lexical-features 49 year figure 2.3 ait year distribution has been microfilmed by university-microfilms , inc. (umi) j * the corpus is a fairly exhaustive set of theses classified as ai by umi from the years 1987 to 1997 . a histogram of the theses distribution by year is shown in figure 2.3 . we will focus on a handful of characteristics of each thesis : ï thesis number ï title ï author ï year ï university ï advisor ï language ï abstract ï degree for now , we will lump these attributes into two categories : textual fields and structured attributes . structured attributes are ones for which we can reason more formally , using database and artificial-intelligence techniques . for now , we will concentrate on only the textual fields . the abstract will be the primary textual element associated with each thesis , while its title (also a textual field) will be used as its proxy - a synopsis of more about ait origins 50 finding out about the thesis that conveys much of its meaning in a highly abbreviated form . proxies will prove very important surrogates for the documents (for example , when users are presented with hitlists of retrieved documents) . the second corpus we will study could not be provided on the cd because you must provide it yourself ; it is all of your email . email is now a fundamental form of transient , nearly immediate communication for many , but the resulting permanent record of these conversations can also be treated as a static , long-lived type of `` literature '' [belew and rentzepis , 1990] . we will assume that with disk-storage as cheaply available as it how do i index is today , you at some point began to collect email . ^ typically , some of my email ? ^ jg w {\ \ \ ye email others have sent you , but you may have also kept a copy of all of your `` outgoing '' email . many email-clients support onthe-fly segregation of email into separate folders . minimally , this means that our procedures for indexing email must be capable of traversing elaborate directory-structures . later , we will also consider the use of this user-generated structure as a source for learning ; cf. section 7.4 . the directory in which you have filed an email-message is one feature we may associate with each message ; whether it is an incoming or outgoing message is another . but of course email also has many structured attributes associated with it , in its header . these include : ï from : ïto : ï cc : ï subject : ï date : in general , we will put off all consideration of structured attributes associated with documents until later . for now , simply note the many parallels between our two example corpora : both have well-defined authors , well-defined time-stamps , and excellent and obvious candidates for proxy text .
