2.7.2 latent-semantic-indexing model as discussed earlier , summarizing the contents of documents and queries through a set of index-terms can lead to poor retrieval-performance due to two effects . first , many unrelated documents might be included in the answer set . second , relevant documents which are not indexed by any of the query keywords are not retrieved . the main reason for these two effects is the inherent vagueness associated with a retrieval-process which is based on keyword sets . the ideas in a text are more related to the concepts described in it than to the index-terms used in its description . thus , the process of matching documents to a given query could be based on concept-matching instead of index term matching . this would allow the retrieval of documents even when they are not indexed by query index-terms . for instance , a document could be retrieved because it shares concepts with another document which is relevant to the given query . latent-semantic-indexing is an approach introduced in 1988 which addresses these issues (for clustering-based approaches which also address these issues , see chapter 5) . the main idea in the latent-semantic-indexing model [287] is to map each document and query-vector into a lower dimensional space which is associated with concepts . this is accomplished by mapping the index term vectors into this lower dimensional space . the claim is that retrieval in the reduced space may be superior to retrieval in the space of index-terms . before proceeding , let us define basic terminology . definition as before , let t he the number of index-terms in the collection and n be the total number of documents . define m = (mij) as a term-document association-matrix with t rows and n columns . to each element m ^ of this matrix is assigned a weight w {^ associated with the term-document pair {kt.dj \ . this u \ , j weight could be generated using the tf-idf-weighting technique common in the classic vector-space-model alternative algebraic-models 45 latent-semantic-indexing proposes to decompose the m association-matrix in three components using singular-value-decomposition as follows . m = ksd1 the-matrix k is the-matrix of eigenvectors derived from the term-to-term correlation-matrix given by mm1 (see chapter 5) . the-matrix dl is the-matrix of eigenvectors derived from the transpose of the document-to-document matrix given by mlm . the-matrix s is an r x r diagonal matrix of singular-values where r ó min (t , n) is the rank of m. consider now that only the s largest singular-values of s are kept along with their corresponding columns in k and dt (i.e. , the remaining singular-values of 5 are deleted) . the resultant ms matrix is the-matrix of rank s which is closest to the original matrix m in the least-square sense . this matrix is given by ms = ksssdi s where 5 , 5 lt ; r , is the dimensionality of a reduced concept-space . the selection of a value for s attempts to balance two opposing effects . first , s should be large enough to allow fitting all the structure in the real-data . second , s should be small enough to allow filtering out all the non-relevant representational details (which are present in the conventional index-term_based representation) . the relationship between any two documents in the reduced space of dimensionality 5 can be obtained from the mlms matrix given by = (kls.dta) tktsadta = dsssssdl = (dsss) (dsssy in the above matrix , the (i , j) element quantifies the relationship between documents dx and dj . to rank documents with regard to a given user-query , we simply model the query as a pseudo-document in the original m term-document-matrix . assume the query is modeled as the document with number 0 . then , the first row in the matrix mlms provides the ranks of all documents with respect to this query . since the matrices used in the latent-semantic-indexing model are of rank s , s ´ t , and s ´ n , they form an efficient indexing-scheme for the documents in the collection . further , they provide for elimination of noise (present in index term-based representations) and removal of redundancy . the latent-semantic-indexing model introduces an interesting conceptualization of the information-retrieval problem based on the theory of singular-value-decomposition . thus , it has its value as a new-theoretical-framework . whether it is superior in practical situations with general collections remains to be verified . 46 modeling query terms document terms documents figure 2.7 a neural-network-model for information-retrieval .
