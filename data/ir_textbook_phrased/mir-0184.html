10.3.1 models of interaction most accounts of the information-access process assume an interaction-cycle consisting of query-specification , receipt and examination of retrieval results , and then either stopping or reformulating the query and repeating the process the information-access process 263 until a perfect result-set is found [700 , 726] . in more detail , the standard process can be described according to the following sequence of steps (see figure 10.2) : (1) start with an information-need . (2) select a system and collections to search on . (3) formulate a query . (4) send the query to the system . (5) receive the results in the form of information items . (6) scan , evaluate , and interpret the results . (7) either stop , or , (8) reformulate the query and go to step 4 . this simple interaction-model (used by web-search-engines) is the only model that most information seekers see today . this model does not take into account the fact that many users dislike being confronted with a long disorganized list of retrieval results that do not directly address their information-needs . it also contains an underlying assumption that the user 's information-need is static and the information-seeking process is one of successively refining a query until it retrieves all and only those documents relevant to the original information-need . information-need query send to system reformulate receive results evaluate results no ^ done ? \ stop figure 10.2 processes . a simplified diagram of the standard-model of the information-access 264 user-interfaces and visualization in actuality , users learn during the search-process . they scan information , read the titles in result sets , read the retrieved documents themselves , viewing lists of topics related to their query terms , and navigating within hyperlinked web-sites . the recent advent of hyperlinks as a pivotal part of the information-seeking process makes it no longer feasible to ignore the role of scanning and navigation within the search-process itself . in particular , today a near-miss is much more acceptable than it was with bibliographic-search , since an information seeker using the-web can navigate hyperlinks from a near-miss in the hopes that a useful page will be a few links away . the standard-model also downplays the interaction that takes place when the user scans terms suggested as a result of relevance-feedback , scans thesaurus structures , or views thematic overviews of document-collections . it de-emphasizes the role of source-selection , which is increasingly important now that , for the first time , tens of thousands of information collections are immediately reachable for millions of people . thus , while useful for describing the basics of information-access systems , this simple interaction-model is being challenged on many fronts [65 , 614 , 105 , 365 , 192] . bates [65] proposes the ` berry-picking ' model of information-seeking , which has two main points . the first is that , as a result of reading and learning from the information encountered throughout the search-process , the users ' information-needs , and consequently their queries , continually shift . information encountered at one point in a search may lead in a new , unanticipated direction . the original goal may become partly fulfilled , thus lowering the priority of one goal in favor of another . this is posed in contrast to the assumption of ` standard ' information-retrieval that the user 's information-need remains the same throughout the search-process . the second point is that users ' information-needs are not satisfied by a single , final retrieved set of documents , but rather by a series of selections and bits of information found along the way . this is in contrast to the assumption that the main goal of the search-process is to hone down the set of retrieved documents into a perfect match of the original information-need . the berry-picking model is supported by a number of observational-studies [236 , 105] , including that of o'day and jeffries [614] . they found that the information-seeking process consisted of a series of interconnected but diverse searches on one problem-based theme . they also found that search-results for a goal tended to trigger new goals , and hence search in new directions , but that the context of the problem and the previous searches was carried from one stage of search to the next . they also found that the main value of the search resided in the accumulated learning and acquisition of information that occurred during the search-process , rather than in the final results set . thus , a user-interface for information-access should allow users to reassess their goals and adjust their search-strategy accordingly . a related situation occurs when users encounter a ` trigger ' that causes them to pursue a different strategy temporarily , perhaps to return to the current unfinished activity at a later time . an implication of these observations is that the user-interface should support search-strategies by making it easy to follow trails with unanticipated results . this can be accomplished in part by supplying ways to record the progress the information-access process 265 of the current strategy and to store , find , and reload intermediate results , and by supporting pursuit of multiple strategies simultaneously . the user-interface should also support methods for monitoring the status of the current strategy in relation to the user 's current task and high-level goals . one way to cast the activity of monitoring the progress of a search-strategy relative to a goal or subgoal is in terms of a cost/benefit-analysis , or an analysis of diminishing returns [690] . this kind of analysis assumes that at any point in the search-process , the user is pursuing the strategy that has the highest expected-utility . if , as a consequence of some local tactical choices , another strategy presents itself as being of higher utility than the current one , the current one is (temporarily or permanently) abandoned in favor of the new strategy . there are a number of theories and frameworks that contrast browsing , querying , navigating , and scanning along several dimensions [75 , 159 , 542 , 804] . here we assume that users scan information-structure , be it titles , thesaurus terms , hyperlinks , category labels , or the results of clustering , and then either select a displayed item for some purpose (to read in detail , to use as input to a query , to navigate to a new page of information) or formulate a query (either by recalling potential words or by selecting categories or suggested terms that have been scanned) . in both cases , a new set of information is then made viewable for scanning . queries tend to produce new , ad-hoc collections of information that have not been gathered together before , whereas selection retrieves information that has already been composed or organized . navigation refers to following a chain of links , switching from one view to another , toward some goal , in a sequence of scan and select operations . browsing refers to the casual , mainly undirected exploration of information-structures , and is usually done in tandem with selection , although queries can also be used to create subcollections to browse through . an important aspect of the interaction-process is that the output of one action should be easily used as the input to the next .
