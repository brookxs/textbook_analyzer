1.2.3 document descriptors we 've introduced keywords as features mentioned by users as part of their queries , but the other face of keywords is as descriptive features of documents . that is , we might naturally say that a document is about robotics . users mentioning robotics in their query should expect to get those documents that are about this topic . keywords must therefore also function as the documents ' description-language . the same vocabulary of words used in queries must be used to describe the topical content of each and every document . keywords become our characterization of what each document is about . indexing is the process of associating one or more keywords with each document . the vocabulary used can either be controlled or uncontrolled (a.k.a. closed vocabularies or open vocabularies) . suppose we decide to have all the documents in our corpus manually indexed by their authors ; this is quite common in many conference-proceedings , for example . if we provide a list of potential keywords and tell authors they must restrict their choices to terms on this list , we are using a controlled-indexing-vocabulary . on the other hand , if we allow the authors to assign any terms they choose , the resulting index has an uncontrolled vocabulary [svenonius , 1986] . to get a feel for the indexing process , imagine that you are given a piece of text and must come up with a set of keywords that describe what the document is about . let 's make the exercise more concrete . you are the author of a report entitled usihg a meuhal network for overview 13 prediction , and you are submitting it to a journal . one of the things this particular journal requires is that the author provide up to six keywords under which this article will be indexed . if you are sending it to the communications of the acm , you might pick a set of keywords that identify , to the audience of computer scientists you think read this publication , connections between this new work and prior work in related areas : nonlinear-regression ; time-series-prediction . but now imagine that you 've decided to submit the exact same paper to byte magazine , and you must again pick keywords that have meaning to this audience . you might choose : neural-networks ; stock-market analysis . what is the context in which these keywords are going to be interpreted ? who 's the audience ? who 's going to understand what these keywords mean ? anticipating the foa activity in which these keywords will function , we know that the real issue to be solved is not only to describe this one document , but to distinguish it from the millions of others in the same corpus . how are the keywords chosen going to be used to distinguish your document from the others ? it is often easiest to imagine keywords as independent features of each document . in fact , however , keywords are best viewed as a relation between a document and its prospective readers , sensitive to both characteristics of the users ' queries and other documents in the same corpus . in other words , the keywords you pick for byte should be different from those you pick for communications of the acmgt ; and for deeper reasons than what we might cynically consider `` spin control .
