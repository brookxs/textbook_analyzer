6.1.1 bibliometric-analysis of science most extensive analysis of citation has been in science . long before newton [newton , 1776] appreciated `` standing on the shoulders of the giants that came before , '' scientists realized that they need one another to advance . in some cases the reference is to arguments on which a new author builds ; in other cases there is disagreement about hypotheses , data , or other facts . the field of bibliometrics has found a great deal of interesting structure in graphs created by bibliographic-citation links . that is , imagine each document in a corpus is represented by a node in a graph , and a directed edge is drawn from document dj to djy just in case dj refers to d {in its bibliography . figure 6.3 shows this citation structure when the references are ordered by a natural , temporal-feature . in any subject area , papers can be indexed chronologically , and a dot is placed at location (/ , j) just in case document d \ cites document dj . because citations can only run backward in time , this graph is upper triangular . '' * '' as with many fields , this one begins with a small number of highly cross-linked papers in the upper-left corner . strong horizontal and vertical stripes can also be seen against a more uncorrelated background . what field 's literature is this ? 188 finding out about citing paper 0 20 classic 40 100 120 140 160 180 research front width Â´ hardness (field) review article 200 figure 6.3 temporal-structure in citations from [price , 1986] . reproduced with permission of columbia university press horizontal lines correspond to citations of classic papers : chestnuts that everyone includes in their bibliography . vertical stripes are papers that have much more extensive bibliographies and that stretch much farther back in time than typical ; these are often referred to as review articles . note how these semantic determinations can be derived from patterns in the syntactic facts of citation . other inferences are also possible . perhaps the most common use of citation-graphs is impact-analysis . in terms of the bibliographic graph , a document 's importance , its effect on a field , is proportional to its in-degree : the number of citation links pointing to a document node . price provides motivation for this measure : flagrant violations there may be , but on the whole there is , whether we like it or not , a reasonably good correlation between inference beyond the index 189 the eminence of a scientist and his productivity of papers . it takes persistence and perseverance to be a good scientist , and these are frequently reflected in a sustained production of scholarly writing . [price , 1986 , pp. 35-36] this suggests a simple heuristic , widely used by university deans who must quickly evaluate faculty members who are up for promotion : important authors are those with higher impact than their peers ! the institute for scientific information (isi) has made an entire industry of collating bibliographic-citations and inverting them . its web of science3 product now makes hypertext-navigation of this valuable information straightforward . similar arguments can be extended to identify important academic departments , universities , even countries . this mode of analysis , used to evaluate individuals (and , by extension , departments , colleges , universities , even countries) consistently makes news when data and politics cross paths [may , 1997] . finally , as mentioned in section 5.2.5 , cocitation can be used as a basis for interdocument similarity : two documents are similar to the extent that their bibliographies overlap . bar-hillel has been credited with the first suggestion of using cocitation as a similarity-metric between documents [bar-hillel , 1957 ; swanson , 1988] ; henry small , eugene garfield , and others have provided some of the first empirical support for this hypothesis [small , 1973 ; garfield , 1979 ; garfield , 1982 ; garfield , 1986] . so-called invisible colleges [merton , 1973] , connecting cliques of self-referential colleagues who are relatively independent of the rest of science , also have been identified . beyond fully isolated cliques , higherorder structure over sets of documents can also be analyzed . we can imagine that the documents of one discipline have much higher connectivity among themselves than they do with papers in other disciplines . a new paper , whose bibliography cites papers coming from more than one discipline , can therefore be imagined to be a new cutting-edge synthesis . bibliometrics has also made clear many dangers in using citation data . what we might call the norm of scholarship , the average number of citations in a document , seems to be about 10 to 20 [price , 1986 , p. 161] . some scientific disciplines rely on much longer bibliographies 3 www.webofscienoe.oom / 190 finding out about than others ; within a discipline , idiosyncratic author variations in bibliography length are also common .
