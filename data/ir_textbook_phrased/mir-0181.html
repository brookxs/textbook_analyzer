10.2.2 the role of visualization the tools of computer-interface design are familiar to most computer-users today : windows , menus , icons , dialog-boxes , and so on . these make use of bitmapped display and computer-graphics to provide a oiore accessible interface 260 user-interfaces and visualization than command-line-based displays . a less familiar but growing area is that of information-visualization , which attempts to provide visual depictions of very-large information-spaces . humans are highly attuned to images and visual-information [769 , 456 , 483] . pictures and graphics can be captivating and appealing , especially if well designed . a visual-representation can communicate some kinds of information much more rapidly and effectively than any other method . consider the difference between a written description of a person 's face and a photograph of it , or the difference between a table of numbers containing a correlation and a scatter-plot showing the same information . the growing prevalence of fast graphics-processors and high-resolution color monitors is increasing interest in information-visualization . scientific-visualization , a rapidly advancing branch of this field , maps physical phenomena onto two - or three-dimensional representations [433] . an example of scientific-visualization is a colorful image of the pattern of peaks and valleys on the ocean floor ; this provides a view of physical phenomena for which a photograph can not (currently) be taken . instead , the image is constructed from data that represent the underlying phenomena . visualization of inherently abstract information is more difficult , and visualization of textually represented information is especially challenging . language is our main means of communicating abstract ideas for which there is no obvious physical manifestation . what does a picture look like that describes negotiations over a trade agreement in which one party demands concessions on environmental policies while the other requires help in strengthening its currency ? despite the difficulties , researchers are attempting to represent aspects of the information-access process using information-visualization-techniques . some of these will be described later in this chapter . aside from using icons and color highlighting , the main information-visualization-techniques include brushing and unking [233 , 773] , panning and zooming [71] , focus-plus-context [502] , magic leimts [95] , and the use of animation to retain context and help make occluded information visible [676 , 143] . these techniques support dynamic , interactive use . interactivity seems to be an especially important property for visualizing abstract information , although it has not played as large a role within scientific-visualization . brushing and linking refers to the connecting of two or more views of the same data , such that a change to the representation in one view affects the representation in the other views as well . for example , say a display consists of two parts : a histogram and a list of titles . the histogram shows , for a set of documents , how many documents were published each year . the title list shows the titles for the corresponding documents . brushing and linking would allow the user to assign a color , say red , to one bar of the histogram , thus causing the titles in the list display that were published during the corresponding year to also be highlighted in red . panning and zooming refers to the actions of a movie camera that can scan sideways across a scene (panning) or move in for a closeup or back away to get a wider view (zooming) . for example , text-clustering can be used to show a human-computer-interaction 261 top-level view of the main themes in a document-collection (see figures 10.7 and 10.8) . zooming can be used to move ` closer , ' showing individual documents as icons , and then zoom in closer still to see the text associated with an individual document . when zooming is used , the more detail that is visible about a particular item , the less can be seen about the surrounding items . focus-plus-context is used to partly alleviate this effect . the idea is to make one portion of the view รณ the focus-of-attention รณ larger , while simultaneously shrinking the surrounding objects . the farther an object is from the focus-of-attention , the smaller it is made to appear , like the effect seen in a fisheye camera lens (also in some door peepholes) . magic-lenses are directly manipulable transparent windows that , when overlapped on some other data-type , cause a transformation to be applied to the underlying data , thus changing its appearance (see figure 10.13) . the most straightforward application of magic-lenses is for drawing tasks , and it is especially useful if used as a two-handed-interface . for example , the left hand can be used to position a color lens over a drawing of an object . the right hand is used to mouse-click on the lens , thus causing the appearance of the underlying object to be transformed to the color specified by the lens . additionally , there are a large number of graphical methods for depicting trees and hierarchies , some of which make use of animation to show nodes that would otherwise be occluded (hidden from view by other nodes) [286 , 364 , 407 , 478 , 676] . it is often useful to combine these techniques into an-interface layout consisting of an overview plus details [321 , 644] . an overview , such as a table-of-contents of a large manual , is shown in one window . a mouse-click on the title of the chapter causes the text of the chapter itself to appear in another window , in a linking action (see figure 10.19) . panning and zooming or focus-plus-context can be used to change the view of the contents within the overview window .
