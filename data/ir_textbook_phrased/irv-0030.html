conclusion let me briefly summarise the logical-structure of this chapter . it started very generally with a descriptive look at automatic-classification and its uses . it then discussed association measures which form the basis of an important class of classification-methods . next came a breakdown of classification-methods . this was followed by a statement of the hypothesis underlying the use of automatic-classification in document-clustering . it went on to examine in some detail the use of classification-methods in ir leading up to recommendation of single-link for document-clustering . finally we made some practical points about implementation . this chapter ended on a rather practical note . we continue in this vein in the next chapter where we discuss file-structures . these are important if we are to appreciate how it is that we can get dictionaries , document-clustering , search-strategies , and such like to work inside a computer .
