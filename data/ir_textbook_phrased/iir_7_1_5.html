impact ordering 7.1.4 6.3.3 document-at-a-time 6.14 term-at-a-time the idea is to order the documents in the postings list of term by decreasing order of . thus , the ordering of documents will vary from one postings list to another , and we can not compute scores by a concurrent traversal of the postings lists of all query terms . given postings lists ordered by decreasing order of , two ideas have been found to significantly lower the number of documents for which we accumulate scores : (1) when traversing the postings list for a query-term , we stop after considering a prefix of the postings list - either after a fixed number of documents have been seen , or after the value of has dropped below a threshold ; (2) when accumulating scores in the outer loop of figure 6.14 , we consider the query terms in decreasing order of idf , so that the query terms likely to contribute the most to the final scores are considered first . this latter idea too can be adaptive at the time of processing a query : as we get to query terms with lower idf , we can determine whether to proceed based on the changes in document scores from processing the previous query-term . if these changes are minimal , we may omit accumulation from the remaining query terms , or alternatively process shorter prefixes of their postings lists . these ideas form a common generalization of the methods introduced in sections 7.1.2 -7.1.4 . we may also implement a version of static ordering in which each postings list is ordered by an additive combination of static and query-dependent scores . we would again lose the consistency of ordering across postings , thereby having to process query terms one at time accumulating scores for all documents as we go along . depending on the particular scoring-function , the postings list for a document may be ordered by other quantities than term-frequency ; under this more general setting , this idea is known as impact ordering .
