bibliographic remarks there is now a vast literature on file-structures although there are very few survey articles . where possible i shall point to some of the more detailed discussions which emphasise an application in ir . of course the chapter on file organisation in the annual review is a good source of references as well . chapter 7 of salton 's latest book contains a useful introduction to file organisation techniques [34] . a general article on data-structures of a more philosophical nature well worth reading is mealey [32] . a description of the use of a sequential file in an on-line environment may be found in negus and hall [36] . the effectiveness and efficiency of an inverted-file has been extensively compared with a file-structure based on clustering by murray [37] . ein-dor [38] has done a comprehensive comparison between an inverted-file and a tree structured file . it is hard to find a discussion of an index-sequential file which makes special reference to the needs of document-retrieval . index-sequential organisation is now considered to be basic software which can be used to implement a variety of other file organisations . nevertheless it is worth studying some of the aspects of its implementation . for this i recommend the paper by mcdonell and montgomery [39] who give a detailed description of an implementation for a mini-computer . multi-lists and cellular multi-lists are fairly well covered by lefkovitz [40] . ring structures have been very popular in cad and have been written up by gray [4l] . extensive use was made of a modified threaded list by van rijsbergen [42] in his cluster-based-retrieval experiments . the doubly chained tree has been adequately dealt with by stanfel [21,22] and patt [23] . work on tree-structures in ir goes back a long way as illustrated by the early papers by salton [43] and sussenguth [44] . trees have always attracted much attention in computer-science , mainly for the ability to reduce expected search times in data-retrieval . one of the earliest papers on this topic is by windley [45] but the most extensive discussion is still to be found in knuth [28] where not only methods of construction are discussed but also techniques of reorganisation . more recently a special kind of tree , called a trie , has attracted attention . this is a tree-structure which has records stored at its terminal nodes , and discriminators at the internal-nodes . a discriminator at a node is made up from the attributes of the records dominated by that node . or as knuth puts it : ' a trie is essentially a m-ary tree whose nodes are m-place vectors with components corresponding to digits or characters . each node on level l represents the set of all keys that begin with a certain sequence of l characters ; the node specifies an m-way branch depending on the (l + 1) st character . ' tries were invented by fredkins [46] , further considered by sussenguth [44] , and more recently studied by burkhard [47] , rivest [48] , and bentley [49] . the use of tries in data-retrieval where one is interested in either a match or mismatch is very similar to the construction of hierarchic document-classification , where each node of the tree representing the hierarchy is also associated with a ` discriminator ' used to direct the search for relevant documents (see for example figure 5.3 in chapter 5) . the use of hashing in document-retrieval is dealt with in higgins and smith [50] , and chous [51] . it has become fashionable to refer to document-collections which have been clustered as clustered files . i have gone to some pains to avoid the use of this terminology because of the conceptual difference that exists between a structure which is inherent in the data and can be discovered by clustering , and an organisation of the data to facilitate its manipulation inside a computer . unfortunately this distinction becomes somewhat blurred when clustering-techniques are used to generate a physical organisation of data . for example , the work by bell et al. [52] is of this nature . furthermore , it has recently become popular to cluster records simply to improve the efficiency of retrieval . buckhard and keller [53] base the design of a file-structure on maximal complete subgraphs (or cliques) . hatfield and gerald [54] have designed a paging algorithm for a virtual-memory store based on clustering . simon and guiho [55] look at methods for preserving ` clusters ' in the data when it is mapped onto a physical storage device . some of the work that has been largely ignored in this chapter , but which is nevertheless of importance when considering the implementation of a file-structure , is concerned directly with the physical organisation of a storage device in terms of block sizes , etc. . unfortunately , general statements about this are rather hard to make because the organisation tends to depend on the hardware characteristics of the device and computer . representative of work in this area is the paper by lum et al. [56] .
