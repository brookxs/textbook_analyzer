14.3.3 opacs : vendors and products the opac market is a specialized one , and products are developed and marketed by a limited number of vendors who compete for market position . while it is rare to find a library of any size that does not have a library-management system , libraries are constantly in a state of flux , upgrading their systems as old ones become obsolete or unsupported , and introducing new systems . for example , many academic-libraries had opacs based on the venerable mainframe-based notis software , and have undertaken to identify a suitable replacement . most of the vendors target niche-markets : academic-libraries , public-libraries , and school and special-libraries . profiles of three such vendors are found in figure 14.9 . fuller details of these and other systems can be found in [351] and [61] .
