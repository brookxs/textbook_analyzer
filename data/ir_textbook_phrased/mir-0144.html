8.5.1 brute-force the brute-force (bf) algorithm is the simplest possible one . it consists of merely trying all possible pattern positions in the text . for each such position , it verifies whether the pattern matches at that position . see figure 8.13 . since there are o (n) text positions and each one is examined at o (m) worst-case cost , the worst-case of brute-force searching is 0 (mn) . however , its average 210 indexing and searching case is o (n) (since on random text a mismatch is found after (9 (1) comparisons on average) . this algorithm does not need any pattern preprocessing . many algorithms use a modification of this scheme . there is a window of length m which is slid over the text . it is checked whether the text in the window is equal to the pattern (if it is , the window-position is reported as a match) . then , the window is shifted forward . the algorithms mainly differ in the way they check and shift the window .
