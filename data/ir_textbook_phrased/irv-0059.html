introduction so far in this book we have made very little use of probability-theory in modelling any sub-system in ir . the reason for this is simply that the bulk of the work in ir is non-probabilistic , and it is only recently that some significant headway has been made with probabilistic-methods [1,2,3] . the history of the use of probabilistic-methods goes back as far as the early sixties but for some reason the early ideas never took hold . in this chapter i shall be describing methods of retrieval , i.e. searching and stopping rules , based on probabilistic considerations . in chapter 2 i dealt with automatic-indexing based on a probabilistic-model of the distribution of word tokens within a document (text) ; here i will be concerned with the distribution of index-terms over the set of documents making up a collection or file . i shall be relying heavily on the familiar assumption that the distribution of index-terms throughout the collection , or within some subset of it , will tell us something about the likely relevance of any given document . perhaps it is as well to warn the reader that some of the material in this chapter is rather mathematical . however , i believe that the framework of retrieval discussed in this chapter is both elegant and potentially extremely powerful * . although the work on it has been rather recent and thus some may feel that it should stand the test of time , i think it probably represents the most important break-through in ir in the last few years . therefore i unashamedly make this chapter theoretical , since the theory must be thoroughly understood if any further progress is to be made . there are a number of equivalent ways of presenting the basic theory ; i have chosen to present it in such a way that connections with other fields such as pattern-recognition are easily made . i shall have more to say about other formulations in the bibliographic remarks at the end of the chapter . the fundamental mathematical tool for this chapter is bayes ' theorem : most of the equations derive directly from it . although the underlying mathematics may at first look a little complicated the interpretation is rather simple . so , let me try and immediately given some interpretation of what is to follow . * this was recognised by maron in his ` the logic behind a probabilistic interpretation ' as early as 1964 [4] . remember that the basic instrument we have for trying to separate the relevant from the non-relevant documents is a matching-function , whether it be that we are in a clustered environment or an unstructured one . the reasons for picking any particular matching-function have never been made explicit , in fact mostly they are based on intuitive argument in conjunction with ockham 's razor . now in this chapter i shall attempt to use simple probability-theory to tell us what a matching-function should look like and how it should be used . the arguments are mainly theoretical but in my view fairly conclusive . the only remaining doubt is about the acceptability of the assumptions , which i shall try and bring out as i go along . the data used to fix such a matching-function are derived from the knowledge of the distribution of the index-terms throughout the collection of some subset of it . if it is defined on some subset of documents then this subset can be defined by a variety of techniques : sampling , clustering , or trial retrieval . the data thus gathered are used to set the values of certain parameters associated with the matching-function . clearly , should the data contain relevance information then the process of defining the matching-function can be iterated by some feedback-mechanism similar to the one due to rocchio described in the previous chapter . in this way the parameters of the matching-function can be ` learnt ' . it is on matching-functions derived from relevance information that we shall concentrate . it will be assumed in the sequel that the documents are described by binary state attributes , that is , absence or presence of index-terms . this is not a restriction on the theory , in principle the extension to arbitrary attributes can be worked out , although it is not clear that this would be worth doing [5] .
