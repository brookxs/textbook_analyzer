2.8.1 bayesian-networks bayesian-networks [630] are directed-acyclic-graphs (dags) in which the nodes represent random variables , the arcs portray causal-relationships between these alternative probabilistic-models 49 variables , and the strengths of these causal influences are expressed by conditional-probabilities . the parents of a node (which is then considered as a child node) are those judged to be direct causes for it . this causal-relationship is represented in the dag by a link directed from each parent node to the child node . the roots of the network are the nodes without parents . let xi be a node in a bayesian-network g and tx % be the set of parent nodes of # $ . the influence of yx % on xi can be specified by any set of functions fi (xi , fxl) that satisfy lt ; , rsl) = o lt ; fi (xurxt) lt ; i where x {also refers to the states of the random-variable associated to the node this specification is complete and consistent because the product y [ii fi (xi , tx constitutes a joint-probability-distribution for the nodes in g. figure 2.8 an example of a bayesian-network . figure 2.8 illustrates a bayesian-network for a joint-probability-distribution p (xi , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5) . in this case , the dependencies declared in the network allow the natural expression of the joint-probability-distribution in terms of local conditional-probabilities (a key advantage of bayesian-networks) as follows . the probability p (#i) is called the prior-probability for the network and can be used to model previous knowledge about the semantics of the application .
