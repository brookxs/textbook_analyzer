vector-space scoring and query operator interaction vector-space scoring supports so-called free-text-retrieval , in which a query is specified as a set of words without any query-operators connecting them . it allows documents matching the query to be scored and thus ranked , unlike the boolean , wildcard and phrase queries studied earlier . classically , the interpretation of such free-text queries was that at least one of the query terms be present in any retrieved document . however more recently , web-search-engines such as google have popularized the notion that a set of terms typed into their query boxes (thus on the face of it , a free-text query) carries the semantics of a conjunctive-query that only retrieves documents containing all or most query terms . subsections boolean-retrieval wildcard queries phrase queries
