7.2.3 stemming frequently , the user specifies a word in a query but only a variant of this word is present in a relevant-document . plurals , gerund forms , and past tense suffixes are examples of syntactical variations which prevent a perfect match between a query word and a respective document word . this problem can be partially overcome with the substitution of the words by their respective stems . a stem is the portion of a word which is left after the removal of its affixes (i.e. , prefixes-and-suffixes) . a typical example of a stem is the word connect which is the stem for the variants connected , connecting , connection , and connections . stems are thought to be useful for improving retrieval-performance because they reduce variants of the same root word to a common concept . furthermore , stemming has the secondary effect of reducing the size of the indexing-structure because the number of distinct index-terms is reduced . while the argument supporting stemming seems sensible , there is controversy in the literature about the benefits of stemming for retrieval-performance . in fact , different studies lead to rather conflicting conclusions . frakes [275] compares eight distinct studies on the potential benefits of stemming . while he favors the usage of stemming , the results of the eight experimental-studies he investigated do not allow us to reach a satisfactory conclusion . as a result of these doubts , many web-search-engines do not adopt any stemming algorithm whatsoever . frakes distinguishes four types of stemming strategies : affix removal , table-lookup , successor variety , and n-grams . table-lookup consists simply of looking for the stem of a word in a table . it is a simple procedure but one which is dependent on data on stems for the whole language . since such data is not readily available and might require considerable storage space , this type of stemming algorithm might not be practical . successor variety stemming is based on the determination of morpheme boundaries , uses knowledge from structural linguistics , and is more complex than affix removal stemming algorithms . n-grams stemming is based on the identification of digrams and trigrams and is more a term-clustering procedure than a stemming one . affix removal stemming is intuitive , simple , and can be implemented efficiently . thus , in the remainder of this section we concentrate our discussion on algorithms for affix removal stemming only . in affix removal the most important part is suffix removal because most variants of a word are generated by the introduction of suffixes (instead of predocument preprocessing 169 fixes) . while there are three or four well known suffix removal algorithms , the most popular one is that by porter because of its simplicity and elegance . despite being simpler , the porter algorithm yields results comparable to those of the more sophisticated algorithms . the porter algorithm uses a suffix list for suffix-stripping . the idea is to apply a series of rules to the suffixes of the words in the text . for instance , the rule s ógt ; 0 (7.1) is used to convert plural forms into their respective singular forms by substituting the letter s by nil . notice that to identify the suffix we must examine the last letters in the word . furthermore , we look for the longest sequence of letters which matches the left hand side in a set of rules . thus , application of the two following rules sses ógt ; ss (7.2) to the word stresses yields the stem stress instead of the stem stresse . by separating such rules into five distinct phases , the porter algorithm is able to provide effective stemming while running fast . a detailed description of the porter algorithm can be found in the appendix .
