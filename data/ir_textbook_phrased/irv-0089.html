the model we start by examining the structure which it is reasonable to assume for the measurement of effectiveness . put in other words , we examine the conditions that the factors determining effectiveness can be expected to satisfy . we limit the discussion here to two factors , namely precision-and-recall , although this is no restriction , different factors could be analysed , and , as will be indicated later , more than two factors can simplify the analysis . if r is the set of possible recall values and p is the set of possible precision values then we are interested in the set r x p with a relation on it . we shall refer to this as a relational-structure and denote it lt ; r x p , gt ; = gt ; where gt ; = is the binary relation on r x p. (we shall use the same symbol for less than or equal to , the context will make clear what the domain is .) all we are saying here is that for any given point (r , p) we wish to be able to say whether it indicates more , less or equal effectiveness than that indicated by some other point . the kind of order relation is a weak order . to be more precise : definition 1 . the relational-structure lt ; r x p , gt ; = gt ; is a weak order if-and-only-if for e1 , e2 , e3 [[propersubset]] r x p the following axioms are satisfied : (1) connectedness : either e1 gt ; = e2 or e2 gt ; = e1 (2) transitivity : if e1 gt ; = e2 and e2 gt ; = e3 then e1 gt ; = e3 we insist that if two pairs can be ordered both ways then (r1 , p1) ~ (r2 , p2) , i.e. equivalent not necessarily equal . the transitivity condition is obviously desirable . we now turn to a second condition which is commonly called independence . this notion captures the idea that the two components contribute their effects independently to the effectiveness . definition 2 . a relation gt ; = on r x p is independent if-and-only-if , for r1 , r2 [[propersubset]] r , (r1 , p) gt ; = (r2 , p) for some p [[propersubset]] p implies (r1 , p ') gt ; = (r2 , p ') for every p ' [[propersubset]] p ; and for p1 , p2 [[propersubset]] p , (r , p1) gt ; = (r , p 2) for some r [[propersubset]] r implies (r ' , p1) gt ; = (r ' , p 2) for every r ' [[propersubset]] r. all we are saying here is , given that at a constant recall (precision) we find a difference in effectiveness for two values of precision (recall) then this difference can not be removed or reversed by changing the constant value . we now come to a condition which is not quite as obvious as the preceding ones . to make it more meaningful i shall need to use a diagram , figure 7.12 , which represents the ordering we have got so far with definitions 1 and 2 . the lines l1 and l2 are lines of equal effectiveness that is any two points (r , p) , (r ' , p ') [[propersubset]] li are such that (r , p) ~ (r ' , p ') (where ~ indicates equal effectiveness) . now let us assume that we have the points on l1 and l2 a but wish to deduce the relative ordering in between these two lines . one may think of this as an interpolation procedure . definition 3 (thomsen condition) . for every r1 , r2 , r3 [[propersubset]] r and p1 , p2 , p3 [[propersubset]] p , (r1 , p3) ~ (r3 , p 2) and (r3 , p1) ~ (r2 , p 3) imply that (r1 , p1) ~ (r2 , p 2) . intuitively this can b e reasoned as follows . the intervals r1 r3 and p2 p 3 are equivalent since an increase in the r-factor by r1 r3 and an increase in the p-factor by p2 p3 starting from (r1 , p3) lead to the same effectiveness (points on l2) . it therefore follows that a decrease in each factor starting from equal effectiveness , in this case the two points (r3 , r1) and (r2 , p3) on l1 , should lead to equal effectiveness . the fourth condition is one concerned with the continuity of each component . it makes precise what intuitively we would expect when considering the existence of intermediate values . definition 4 (restricted solvability) . a relation gt ; = on r x p satisfies restricted solvability provided that : (1) whenever r , ` r , r [[propersubset]] r and p , p ' [[propersubset]] p for which (` r , p ') gt ; = (r , p) gt ; = (r , p ') then there exists r [[propersubset]] r s.t. (r , p ') ~ (r , p) ; (2) a similar condition holds on the second component . in other words we are ensuring that the equation (r ' , p ') ~ (r , p) is soluble for r ' provided that there exist ` r , r such that (` r , p ') gt ; = (r , p ') gt ; = (r , p ') . an assumption of continuity of the precision-and-recall factors would ensure this . the fifth condition is not limiting in any way but needs to be stated . it requires , in a precise way , that each component is essential . definition 5 . component r is essential if-and-only-if there exist r1 , r2 [[propersubset]] r and p1 [[propersubset]] p such that it is not the case that (r1 , p1) ~ (r2 , p1) . a similar definition holds for p. thus we require that variation in one while leaving the other constant gives a variation in effectiveness . finally we need a technical condition which will not be explained here , that is the archimedean property for each component . it merely ensures that the intervals on a component are comparable . for details the reader is referred to krantz et al. . we now have six conditions on the relational-structure lt ; r x p , gt ; = gt ; which in the theory of measurement are necessary and sufficient-conditions * for it to be an additive conjoint structure . this is enough for us to state the main representation theorem . it is a theorem asserting that if a given relational-structure satisfies certain conditions (axioms) , then a homomorphism into the real numbers is often referred to as a scale . measurement may therefore be regarded as the construction of homomorphisms for empirical relational structures of interest into numerical relational structures that are useful . in our case we can therefore expect to find real-valued functions [[phi]] 1 on r and [[phi]] 2 on p and a function f from re x re into re , 1:1 in each variable , such that , for all r , r ' [[propersubset]] r and p , p ' [[propersubset]] p we have : (r , p) gt ; = (r ' , p ') lt ; = gt ; f [[[phi]] 1 (r) , [[phi]] 2 (p)] gt ; = f [[[phi]] 1 (r ') , [[phi]] 2 (p ')] (note that although the same symbol gt ; = is used , the first is a binary-relation on r x p , the second is the usual one on re , the set of reals .) in other words there are numerical scales [[phi]] i on the two components and a rule f for combining them such that the resultant measure preserves the qualitative ordering of effectiveness . when such a representation exists we say that the structure is decomposable . in this representation the components (r and p) contribute to the effectiveness measure independently . it is not true that all relational structures are decomposable . what is true , however , is that non-decomposable structures are extremely difficult to analyse . a further simplification of the measurement function may be achieved by requiring a special kind of non-interaction of the components which has become known as additive independence . this requires that the equation for decomposable structures is reduced to : (r , p) gt ; = (r ' , p ') lt ; = gt ; [[phi]] 1 (r) + [[phi]] 2 (p) gt ; = [[phi]] 1 (r ') + [[phi]] 2 (p ') where f is simply the addition function . an example of a non-decomposable structure is given by : (r , p) gt ; = (r ' , p ') lt ; = gt ; [[phi]] 1 (r) + [[phi]] 2 (p) + [[phi]] 1 (r) [[phi]] 2 (p) gt ; = [[phi]] 1 (r ') + [[phi]] 2 (p ') + + [[phi]] 1 (r ') [[phi]] 2 (p ') * it can be shown that (starting at the other end) given an additively independent representation the properties defined in 1 and 3 , and the archimedean property are necessary . the structural conditions 4 and 5 are sufficient . here the term [[phi]] 1 [[phi]] 2 is referred to as the interaction term , its absence accounts for the non-interaction in the previous condition . we are now in a position to state the main representation theorem .
