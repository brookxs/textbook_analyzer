6.4.1 sgml sgml stands for standard-generalized-markup-language (iso 8879) and is a metalanguage for tagging text developed by a group led by goldfarb [303] based on earlier work done at ibm . that is , sgml provides the rules for defining a markup-language based on tags . each instance of sgml includes a description of the document structure called a document-type-definition . hence , an sgml-document is defined by : (1) a description of the structure of the document and (2) the text itself marked with tags which describe the structure . we will explain later the syntax associated with the tags . the document type-definition is used to describe and name the pieces that a document is composed of and define how those pieces relate to each other . part of the definition can be specified by an sgml-document type declaration (dtd) . 150 text and multimedia languages and properties other parts , such as the semantics of elements and attributes , or application conventions , can not be expressed formally in sgml . comments can be used , however , to express them informally . this means that all of the rules for applying sgml markup to documents are part of the definition , and those that can be expressed in sgml syntax are represented in the dtd . the dtd does not define the semantics (that is , the meaning , presentation , and behavior) , or intended use , of the tags . however , some semantic-information can be included in comments embedded in the dtd , while more complete information is usually present in separate documentation . this additional documentation typically describes the elements , or logical pieces of data , the attributes , and information about those pieces of data . for example , two tags can have the same name but different semantics in two different applications . tags are denoted by angle brackets (lt ; tagnamegt ;-rrb- . tags are used to identify the beginning and ending of pieces of the document , for example a quote in a literary text . ending tags are specified by adding a slash before the tag name (e.g. , lt ; / tagnamegt ;-rrb- . for example , the tag lt ; / authoxgt ; could be used to identify the element ` name of author , ' which appears in italics and generates a link to a biographic sketch . tag attributes are specified at the beginning of the element , inside the angle brackets and after the nametag using the syntax attname = value . figure 6.3 gives an example of a simple dtd and a document using it . while we do not intend to discuss sgml syntax here , we give a brief description of the example such that the reader can grasp the main ideas . each element represents a tag denoted by its name . the two following characters indicate if the starting and ending tags are compulsory (-) or optional (0) . for example , the ending tag for prolog is necessary while for sender it is not . following that , the inside portion of the content tag is specified using a regular-expression style syntax where v stands for concatenation , 4 | ' stands for logical or , ' ? ' stands for zero or one occurrence , ' * ' stands for zero or more occurrences , and k + ' stands for one or more occurrences of the preceding element . the content tag can be composed of the combination of other tag contents , ascii characters (pcdata) , and binary-data (ndata) , or empty . the possible attributes of a tag are given in an attribute list (attlist) identified by the tag name , followed by the name of each attribute , its type , and if it is required or not (otherwise , the default value is given) . an sgml-document instance is associated with the dtd so that the various tools working with the data know which are the correct tags and how they are organized . the document description generally does not specify how a document should look , for example when it is printed on paper or displayed on a screen . because sgml separates content from format , we can create very good models-of-data that have no mechanism for describing the format , hence , no standard way to output the data in a formatted fashion . therefore , output specifications , which are directions on how to format a document , are often added to sgml documents . for this purpose , output specification standards such as dsssl (document style semantic-specification language) and fosi (formatted output specification instance) were devised . both of these standards define mechanisms for associating style-information with sgml-document instances . markup-languages 151 lt ; ! ósgml dtd for electronic messages -- gt ; lt ; . ` element e-mail -- (prolog , contents) gt ; lt ; ! element prolog -- (sender , address * , subject ? , cc +) gt ; lt ; ! element (sender i address i subject i cc) - 0 (#pcdata) gt ; lt ; ! element contents - - (par i image i audio) + gt ; lt ; ! element par - 0 (ref i #pcdata) + gt ; lt ; ! element ref - 0 empty gt ; lt ; [element (image i audio) - - (#ndata) gt ; lt ; ! attlist e-mail id id #required date.sent date #required status (secret i public) public gt ; lt ; ! attlist ref id idref #required gt ; lt ; ! attlist (image | audio) id id #required gt ; lt ; ! óexample of use of previous dtdógt ; lt ; ! d0ctype e-mail-system `` e-mail . dtd `` gt ; lt ; e-mail id = 94108rby date_sent = 02101998gt ; lt ; prologgt ; lt ; sendergt ; pablo neruda lt ; / sendergt ; lt ; addressgt ; federico garcia lorca lt ; / addressgt ; lt ; addressgt ; ernest hemingway lt ; / addressgt ; lt ; subjectgt ; pictures of my house in isla negra lt ; ccgt ; gabriel garcia marquez lt ; / ccgt ; lt ; / prologgt ; lt ; contentsgt ; lt ; pargt ; as promised in my previous letter , i am sending two digital pictures to show you my house and the splendid view of the pacific ocean from my bedroom (photo lt ; ref idref = f2gt ;-rrb- . lt ; / pargt ; lt ; image id = flgt ; `` photol.gif '' lt ; / imagegt ; lt ; image id = f2gt ; `` photo2.jpg '' lt ; / imagegt ; lt ; pargt ; regards from the south , pablo . lt ; / contentsgt ; figure 6.3 dtd for structuring electronic mails and an example of its use . they are the components of an sgml system used for defining , for instance , that the data identified by a tag should be typeset in italics . one important use of sgml is in the text-encoding-initiative (tei) . the tei is a cooperative project that started in 1987 and includes several us associations related to the humanities and linguistics . the main goal is to generate guidelines for the preparation and interchange of electronic texts for scholarly 152 text and multimedia languages and properties research , as well as for industry . in addition to the guidelines , tei provides several document-formats through sgml dtds . one of the most used formats is tei lite . the tei lite dtd can be used stand-alone or together with the full set of tei dtd files .
