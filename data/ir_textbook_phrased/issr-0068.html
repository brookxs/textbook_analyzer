5 automatic-indexing 5.1 classes of automatic-indexing 5.2 statistical-indexing 5.3 natural-language 5.4 concept-indexing 5.5 hypertext linkages 5.6 summary chapter 3 introduced the concept and objectives of indexing along with its history . this chapter focuses on the process and algorithms to perform indexing . the indexing process is a transformation of an item that extracts the semantics of the topics discussed in the item . the extracted information is used to create the processing tokens and the searchable data-structure . the semantics of the item not only refers to the subjects discussed in the item but also in weighted systems , the depth to which the subject is discussed . the index can be based on the full text of the item , automatic or manual generation of a subset of terms/phrases to represent the item , natural-language representation of the item or abstraction to concepts in the item . the results of this process are stored in one of the data-structures (typically inverted data-structure) described in chapter 4 . distinctions , where appropriate , are made between what is logically kept in an index versus what is physically stored . this text includes chapters on automatic-indexing and user-search techniques . there is a major dependency between the search-techniques to be implemented and the indexing process that stores the information required to execute the search . this text categorizes the indexing-techniques into statistical , natural-language , concept , and hypertext linkages . insight into the rationale for this classification is presented in section 5.1 .
