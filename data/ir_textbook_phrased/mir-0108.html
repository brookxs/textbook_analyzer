6.4.3 xml xml stands for extensible-markup-language and is a simplified subset of sgml . that is , xml is not a markup-language , as html is , but a metalanguage that is capable of containing markup-languages in the same way as sgml . xml allows a human-readable semantic-markup , which is also machine-readable . as a result , xml makes it easier to develop and deploy new specific markup , enabling automatic-authoring , parsing , and processing of networked-data . in some ways , xml alkws one to do many things that today are done by java scripts or other program-interfaces . xml does not have many of the restrictions imposed by html but on the other hand imposes a more rigid syntax on the markup , which becomes important at processing-time . in xml , ending tags can not be omitted . also , tags for elements that do not have any content , like br and img , are specially marked by a slash before the closing angle bracket . xml also distinguishes upper markup-languages 155 lt ; ?

these problems should be resolved in the near future . in the case of semantic-ambiguity between tag names , one goal is to have a namespace such that there is a convention for its use . the extensible style sheet language (xsl) is the xml counterpart of cascading-style-sheets . xsl is designed to transform and style highly-structured , data-rich documents written in xml . for example , with xsl it would be possible to automatically extract a table-of-contents from a document . the syntax of xsl has been defined using xml . in addition to adding style to a document , xsl can be used to transform xml-documents to html and css . this is analogous to macros in a word-processor . another extension to xml , defined using xml , is the extensible linking language (xll) . xll defines different types of links , including external and internal links . in particular , any element type can be the origin of a link and outgoing links can be defined on documents that can not be modified . the behavior of the links is also more generic . the object linked can be embedded in , or replace the document . it is also possible to generate a new context without changing the current application (for example , the object is displayed in a new window) . recent uses of xml include : ï mathematical markup-language (mathml) : two sets of tags , one for presentation of formulas and another for the meaning of mathematical expressions . ï synchronized-multimedia-integration-language (smil) : a declarative-language for scheduling multimedia presentations in the web , where the position and activation time of different objects can be specified . ï resource-description format (already covered in section 6.2) : metadata information for xml should be given using rdf . the xml movement is one indication that a parseable , hierarchical object model will play an increasingly major role in the evolution of html . the next generation of html should be based on a suite of xml tag sets to be used together with mathematics , synchronized-multimedia , and vector-graphics (possibly using the xml-based languages already mentioned) . that is , the emphasis will be on structuring and modeling data rather than on presentation and layout issues .
