4.3 pattern-matching in this section we discuss more specific query formulations (based on the concept of a pattern) which allow the retrieval of pieces of text that have some property . these data-retrieval queries are useful for linguistics , text statistics , and data-extraction . their result can be fed into the composition mechanism described above to form phrases and proximity-queries , comprising what we have called basic queries . basic queries can be combined using boolean-expressions . in this sense we can view these data-retrieval capabilities as enhanced tools for information-retrieval . however , it is more difficult to rank the result of a pattern-matching expression . a pattern is a set of syntactic-features that must occur in a text-segment . those segments satisfying the pattern specifications are said to ` match '' the pattern . we are interested in documents containing segments which match a given search-pattern . each system allows the specification of some types of patterns , which range from very simple (for example , words) to rather complex (such as regular-expressions) . in general , as more powerful is the set of patterns allowed , more involved are the queries that the user can formulate and more complex is the implementation of the search . the most used types of patterns are : pattern-matching 105 ´ words a string (sequence of characters) which must be a word in the text (see section 4.2) . this is the most basic pattern . æ prefixes a string which must form the beginning of a text word . for instance , given the prefix ` comput ' all the documents containing words such as ` computer , ' ` computation , ' ` computing , ' etc. are retrieved . æ suffixes a string which must form the termination of a text word . for instance , given the suffix ` ters ' all the documents containing words such as ` computers , ' ` testers , ' ` painters , ' etc. are retrieved . ´ substrings a string which can appear within a text word . for instance , given the substring ` tal ' all the documents containing words such as ` coastal , ' ` talk , ' ` metallic , ' etc. are retrieved . this query can be restricted to find the substrings inside words , or it can go further and search the substring anywhere in the text (in this case the query is not restricted to be a sequence of letters but can contain word separators) . for instance , a search for ` any flow ' will match in the phrase ' ... many flowers ... . ' ï ranges a pair of strings which matches any word lying between them in lexicographical order . alphabets are normally sorted , and this induces an order into the strings which is called lexicographical order (this is indeed the order in which words in a dictionary are listed) . for instance , the range between words ` held ' and ` hold ' will retrieve strings such as ` hoax ' and ` hissing . ' ï allowing errors a word together with an error-threshold . this search-pattern retrieves all text words which are `` similar ' to the given word . the concept of similarity can be defined in many ways . the general concept is that the pattern or the text may have errors (coming from typing , spelling , or from optical-character-recognition software , among others) , and the query should try to retrieve the given word and what are likely to be its erroneous variants . although there are many models for similarity among words , the most generally accepted in text-retrieval is the levenshtein-distance , or simply edit-distance . the edit-distance between two strings is the minimum number of character insertions , deletions , and replacements needed to make them equal (see chapter 6) . therefore , the query specifies the maximum number of allowed errors for a word to match the pattern (i.e. , the maximum allowed edit-distance) . this model can also be extended to search substrings (not only words) , retrieving any text-segment which is at the allowed edit-distance from the search-pattern . under this extended model , if a typing-error splits ` flower ' into `` f lo wer ' it could still be found with one error , while in the restricted case of words it could not (since neither kflo ' nor ` wer ' are at edit-distance 1 fro in k flower '') . variations on this distance model are of use in computational-biology for searching on dna or protein-sequences as well as in signal-processing . ï regular-expressions some text-retrieval-systems allow searching for regular-expressions . a regular-expression is a rather general pattern built 106 query-languages up by simple strings (which are meant to be matched as substrings) and the following operators : - union : if ei and 62 are regular-expressions , then (ei | e2) matches what t \ or 62 matches . - concatenation : if e \ and e2 are regular-expressions , the occurrences of (ei 62) are formed by the occurrences of e \ immediately followed by those of 62 (therefore simple strings can be thought of as a concatenation of their individual letters) . - repetition : if e is a regular-expression , then (e *) matches a sequence of zero or more contiguous occurrences of e. for instance , consider a query like ` pro (blem | tein) (s | e) (0 | 1 2) * '' (where e denotes the empty-string) . it will match words such as cproblem021 and ` proteins . ' as in previous cases , the matches can be restricted to comprise a whole word , to occur inside a word , or to match an arbitrary text-segment . this can also be combined with the previous type of patterns to search a regular-expression allowing errors . ï extended patterns it is normal to use a more user-friendly query-language to represent some common cases of regular-expressions . extended patterns are subsets of the regular-expressions which are expressed with a simpler syntax . the retrieval-system can internally convert extended patterns into regular-expressions , or search them with specific algorithms . each system supports its own set of extended patterns , and therefore no formal-definition exists . some examples found in many new systems are : - classes of characters , i.e. one or more positions within the pattern are matched by any character from a pre-defined set . this involves features such as case-insensitive matching , use of ranges of characters (e.g. , specifying that some character must be a digit) , complements (e.g. , some character must not be a letter) , enumeration (e.g. , a character must be a vowel) , wild cards (i.e. , a position within the pattern matches with anything) , among others . - conditional-expressions , i.e. , a part of the pattern may or may not appear . - wild characters which match any sequence in the text , e.g. any word which starts as kflo1 and ends with 4ers , ' which matches ` flowers ' as well as ` flounders / - combinations that allow some parts of the pattern to match exactly and other parts with errors .
