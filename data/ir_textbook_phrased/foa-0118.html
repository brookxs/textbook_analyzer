6.2.1 footnotes , hyperfootnotes , and cf. footnote text embellishes a primary text . it provide a more detailed treatment of terms or concepts used in the primary text . a lexical token , typically smaller in size , * creates a correspondence between the primary text and the annotation on it . perhaps the most direct claim of hypertext authors is that the standard linear presentation of text does violence to the more networked way * this footnote does n't do much to amplify , but it does create a small example :-rrb- . 7 www.theatlantic.com/unbound/flashlbks / oomputer/bushf . htm 8 jefferson.village.virginia.edu/elab/lifiol 55.html inference beyond the index 201 in which we naturally conceive of the concepts being discussed . at the same time , the conventional sequential flow through text mandated by printed media does a great deal to support a rhetorical argument . for this reason , this foa text was written first as a traditional book , assuming a basically linear flow . on this linear spine , two hypertext extensions have been added (cf. section 8.2.1) . for example , the primary purpose of the last paragraph was to move (the primary , linear course of the textbook) from a discussion of the syntactic conventions of footnoting to a consideration of communication 's ultimate purposes . because these issues are covered in more depth in section 8.2.1 , a parenthetical cf. reference to this other section was made . the cf. relation is best viewed as an opportunity (offered by the author to a reader) to compare the two passages . ^ cf. for confer in this foa text i have also chosen to distinguish between standard footnotes and hyperfootnotes , which are used to capture more extended digressions . the last paragraph allows readers with access to the cd-rom version of foa who are interested in the latin etymology of the cf. token to poke into that . hyperfootnotes include a caption , providing a clue to what additional-information lies on the other end of the hyperjump ; standard footnotes are referenced by a simple asterisk .
