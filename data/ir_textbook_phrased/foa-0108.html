5.5.6 cost-analysis the discussion of section 4.3.4 suggests that , as with most real-world decisions , there is no perfect way to select relevant documents . even if we can accomplish the prp and order all the documents , there remains a retrieval threshold to set . if we set the threshold too high , we will not show users some documents they might wish to see , and if we set it too low we will show them too many . but we can capture this tension by associating two costs (a.k.a. losses) with each of two possible sources of error . the first cost crn is incurred when we retrieve an irrelevant document , the second cnr when we do n't retrieve a relevant-document . to make these costs concrete , we might imagine that there is a limited resource (hitlist screen real-estate , user-search-time) , and the first cost is proportional to using up this precious resource . similarly , the second cost might be proportional to the cost of losing a malpractice suit , when a legal case on point was n't found but should have been ! in terms of the logodds ranking-function of equation 5.54 , the trade-off between these two costs can be realized by another term added to the constant k of equation 5.55 : / . 1 crn รณ cnr k ' = k + log รณ ---------- รณ (5.56) we can easily imagine adding a knob to a browser reflecting the trade-off between these two costs [russel et al , 1993] .
