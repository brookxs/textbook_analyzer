12.7 trends and research-issues in this chapter wre focused on how to accelerate queries by content on image-databases and , more general , on multimedia-databases . target queries are , e.g. , `` find images with a color-distribution of a sunset photography or , ` find companies whose stock price moves similarly to a given company 's stock . '' the method expects a distance-function tgt ;(-rrb- (given by domain-experts) , which should measure the dissimilarity between two images or objects o \* 02-we mainly examined whole match , range-queries (that is , ` queries by example '' where the user specifies the ideal object and asks for all objects that are within distance e from the ideal object) . extensions to other types of queries (nearest-neighbors , all pairs and subpattern match) are briefly discussed . we focused on the gemini approach , which combines two ideas : ï the first is to devise a kquick-and-dirty '' test , which will eliminate several 362 multimedia-ir : indexing and searching (a) (b) figure 12.10 a collection of documents , after fastmap in 3-d-space : (a) the whole collection and (b) magnification of the dashed box . non-qualifying objects . to achieve that , we should extract / numerical-features from each object , which should somehow describe the object (for example , the first few dft coefficients for a time sequence , or for a grayscale-image) . the key question to ask is ` if we are allowed to use only one numerical feature to describe each data object , what should this feature be ? ' ï the second idea is to further accelerate the search , by organizing these f-dimensional points using state-of-the art spatial-access-methods [400] , like the i ? * ~ trees . these methods typically group neighboring points together , thus managing to discard large unpromising portions of the address-space early . the above two ideas achieve fast searching . moreover , we need to consider the condition under which the above method will be not only fast , but also correct in the sense that it will not miss any qualifying object . notice that false-alarms are acceptable , because they can be discarded , in the obvious way . the answer is provided by the lower-bounding lemma , which intuitively states that the mapping j - (-rrb- of objects to / - d points should make things look closer . in the rest of the chapter , we discussed how to apply gemini for a variety of environments , like id time-sequences and 2d color images . as discussed in the bibliographic notes , gemini has been applied to multiple other settings , like tumor-like shapes , time-sequences with the time-warping distance-function , 2d medical-images , and so on . moreover , it is one of the main reasons behind a strong recent interest on high-dimensionality index-structures . with respect to future trends , probably the most notable and most challenging trend is data-mining in multimedia and mixed-media data-sets . for example , given a collection of medical-records , with demographic data , text-data bibliographic discussion 363 (like history) , 2d images (like x-rays) , and id signals (electrocardiograms) , we want to find correlations , clusters , patterns , and outliers . successful detection of such patterns is the basis for forecasting , for hypothesis-formation , anomaly-detection , and several other knowledge-discovery operations . gemini , insisting on turning every data-type into a feature-vector , should prove extremely useful : the reason is that it opens the door for off-the-shelf statistical and machine-learning packages , which typically expect a set of vectors as input . typical such packages are the ` principal-component-analysis ' (pca , also known as ` latent-semantic-indexing ' (lsi) , ` karhunen-loeve-transform ' (klt) , and ` singular-value-decomposition ' (svd)) , artificial-neural-networks , tree classifiers , to name a few .
