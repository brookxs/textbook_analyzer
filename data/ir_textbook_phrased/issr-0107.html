8 information-visualization 8.1 introduction to information-visualization 8.2 cognitive and perception 8.3 information-visualization technologies 8.4 summary the primary focus on information-retrieval-systems has been in the areas of indexing , searching and clustering versus information-display . this has been due to the inability of technology to provide the technical platforms needed for sophisticated display , academic 's focusing on the more interesting algorithmic based search aspects of information-retrieval , and the multi-disciplinary nature of the hum an-computer interface (hci) . the core-technologies needed to address sophisticated information-visualization have matured , supporting productive research and implementation into commercial products . the commercial demand for these technologies is growing with availability of the `` information highway . '' system designers need to treat the display of data as visual-computing instead of treating the monitor as a replica of paper . functions that are available with electronic display and visualization of data that were not previously provided are (brown-96) : modify representations of data and information or the display condition (e.g. , changing color-scales) use the same representation while showing changes in data (e.g. , moving between clusters of items showing new linkages) animate the display to show changes in space and time enable interactive-input from the user to allow dynamic movement between information-spaces and allow the user to modify data-presentation to optimize personal-preferences for understanding the data . 200 chapter 8 create hyperlinks under user-control to establish relationships between data if information-retrieval had achieved development of the perfect search-algorithm providing close to one hundred per cent precision-and-recall , the need for advances in information-visualization would not be so great . but reality has demonstrated in trec and other information fora that advancements are not even close to achieving this goal . thus , any technique that can reduce the user overhead of finding the needed information will supplement algorithmic achievements in finding potential relevant items . information-visualization addresses how the results of a search may be optimally displayed to the users to facilitate their understanding of what the search has provided and their selection of most likely items of interest to read . visual-displays can consolidate the search-results into a form easily processed by the user 's cognitive-abilities , but in general they do not answer the specific retrieval needs of the user other than suggesting database coverage of the concept and related concepts . the theoretical disciplines of cognitive-engineering and perception provide a theoretical base for information-visualization . cognitive-engineering derives design-principles for visualization-techniques from what we know about the neural processes involved with attention , memory , imagery and information processing of the human-visual-system . by 1989 research had determined that mental depiction plays a role in cognition that is different from mental description . thus , the visual-representation of an item plays as important a role as its symbolic definition in cognition . cognitive-engineering results can be applied to methods of reviewing the concepts contained in items selected by search of an information-system . visualization can be divided into two broad classes : link visualization and attribute (concept) visualization . link visualization displays relationships among items . attribute visualization reveals content relationships across large numbers of items . related to attribute visualization is the capability to provide visual-cues on how search-terms affected the search-results . this assists a user in determining changes required to search statements that will return more relevant items .
