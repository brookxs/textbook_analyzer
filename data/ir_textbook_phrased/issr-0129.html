information-system evaluation 267 11.3 measurement example-trec-resusts until the creation of the text-retrieval conferences (trec) by the defense advance research projects agency (darpa) and the national institute of standards and technology (nist) , experimentation in the area of information-retrieval was constrained by the researcher 's ability to manually create a test database . one of the first test-databases was associated with the cranfield i and ii tests (cleverdon-62 , cleverdon-66) . it contained 1400 documents and 225 queries . it became one of the standard test-sets and has been used by a large number of researchers . other test-collections have been created by fox and sparck jones (fox83 , sparck jones-79) . although there has been some standard usage of the same test-data , in those cases the evaluation-techniques varied sufficiently so that it has been almost impossible to compare results and derive generalizations . this lack of a common base for experimentation constrained the ability of researchers to explain relationships between different experiments and thus did not provide a basis to determine system improvements (sparck jones-81) . even if there had been a better attempt at uniformity in use of the standard collections , all of the standard test-sets suffered from a lack of size that prevented realistic measurements for operational environments . the goal of the text-retrieval-conference was to overcome these problems by making a very-large , diverse test-data-set available to anyone interested in using it as a basis for their testing and to provide a yearly conference to share the results . there have been five trec-conferences since 1992 , usually held in the fall . two types of retrieval are examined at trec : `` adhoc '' query , and `` routing '' (dissemination) , in trec-the normal two word ltad hoc '' is concatenated into a single word . as experience has been gained from trec-1 to trec-5 , the details and focus of the experiments have evolved . trec-provides a set of training-documents and a set of test documents , each over 1 gigabyte in size . it also provides a set of training search topics (along with relevance-judgments from the database) and a set of test topics . the researchers send to the trec-sponsor the list of the top 200 items in ranked order that satisfy the search statements . these lists are used in determining the items to be manually reviewed for relevance and for calculating the results from each system . the search topics are `` user-need '' statements rather than specific queries . this allows maximum flexibility for each researcher to translate the search statement to a query appropriate for their system and assists in the determination of whether an item is relevant . figure 11.3 describes the sources and the number and size of items in the test database (harrnan-95) . figure 11.3 also includes statistics on the number of terms in an item and number of unique terms in the test-databases . the database was initially composed of disks i and 2 . in later trecs , disk 3 of data was added to focus on the routing tests . figure 11.3 b includes in the final column the statistics for the cranfield test-collection . comparing the cranfield collection to the contents of disk 1 shows that the trec-test database is approximately 200 times larger and the 268 chapter 11 average length of the items is doubled . also the dictionary size of unique-words is 20 times larger . all of the documents are formatted in standard-generalized-markup-language (sgml) with a document-type-definition (dtd) included for each collection allowing easy-parsing . sgml is a superset of html and is one of the major standards used by the publishing industry . it was impossible to perform relevance-judgments on all of the items in the test-databases (over 700,000 items) to be used in recall and fallout formulas . the option of performing a random-sample that would find the estimated 200 or more relevant items for each test search would require a very-large sample size to be manually analyzed . instead , the pooling method proposed by sparck jones was used . the top 200 documents based upon the relevance rank from each of the researchers was pooled , redundant items were eliminated and the resultant set was manually reviewed for relevance . in general one-third of the possible items retrieved were unique (e.g. , out of 3300 items 1278 were unique in trec-1) (harman-93) . this ratio also been shown to be true in other experiments (katzer82) . in trec , each test topic was judged by one person across all of the possible documents to ensure consistency of relevance-judgment . the search topics in the initial trec-consisted of a number , domain (e.g. , science-and-technology) , title , description of what constituted a relevant item , narrative-natural-language text for the search , and concepts which were specific search-terms . the following

were calculated in the initial trec . to experiment with a measure called relative operating characteristic (roc) curves , calculation of probability-of-detection (same as recall formula) and calculation of probability of false-alarm (same as fallout) was also tried . this use of a set of common evaluation formulas between systems allows for consistent comparison between different executions of the same algorithm and between different algorithms . the results are represented on recall-precision and recall-fallout graphs (roc curves) . figure 11.4 shows how the two graphs appear . the x-axis plots the recall from zero to 1.0 based upon the assumption that the relevant items judged in the pooling technique account for all relevant items . the precision or fallout value at each of the discrete recall values is calculated based upon reviewing the items , in relevance 270 chapter rank score order , that it requires to reach that recall value . for example , assume there are 200 relevant items . a particular system , to achieve a recall of 40 per cent (.4) requiring retrieval of 80 of the relevant items , requires retrieving the top 160 items with the highest relevance-scores . associated with the precision/recall graph , for the x-axis value of .4 , the y-axis value would be 80/160 or .5 . there are sufficient sources of potential errors in generating the graphs , that they should only be used as relative comparisons between algorithms rather than absolute-performance indicators . it has been proven they do provide useul comparative information . in addition to the search measurements , other standard information on system-performance such as system timing , storage , and specific descriptions on the tests are collected on each system . this data is useful because the trec-objective is to support the migration of techniques developed in a research environment into operational systems . trec-5 was held in november 1996 . the results from each conference have varied based upon understanding from previous conferences and new objectives . a general-trend has been followed to make the tests in each treccloserto realistic operational uses of information-systems (harman-96) . 0 .2 .4 .6 .8 1.0 recall 0 .2 .4 .6 .8 1.0 recall figure 11.4 examples of trec-result charts trec-1 (1992) was constrained by researchers trying to get their systems to work with the very-large test-databases . trec-2 in august 1993 was the first real test of the algorithms which provided insights for the researchers into areas in which their systems needed work . the search statements (user-need statements) were very-large and complex . they reflect long-standing information-needs versus adhoc requests . by trec-3 , the participants were experimenting with techniques for query-expansion and the importance of constraining searches to passages within items versus the total item . there were trade offs available between manual and automatic-query-expansion and the benefits from combining results from multiple retrieval techniques . some of the experiments were driven by the introduction of shorter and less complex search statements . the `` concept '' field , which contained information-system evaluation 271 terms related to the query that a user might be expected to be aware of , was eliminated from the search statements . this change was a major source for the interest into query-expansion techniques . trec-4 introduced significantly shorter queries (average reduction from 119 terms in trec-3 to 16 terms in trec-4) and introduced five new areas of testing called `` tracks '' (harman-96) . the queries were shortened by dropping the title and a narrative field , which provided additional description of a relevant item . the multilingual track expanded trec-4 to test a search in a spanish test-set of 200 mbytes of articles from the `` el norte '' newspaper . the interactive track modified the previous adhoc search testing from a batch to an interactive-environment . since there are no standardized tools for evaluating this environment , the trec-5 goals included development of evaluation-methodologies as well as investigating the search aspects . the database merging task investigated methods for merging results from multiple subcollections into a single hit file . the confusion track dealt with corrupted data . data of this type are found in optical character reader (ocr) conversion of hardcopy to characters or speech-input . the database for trec-had random-errors created in the text . usually in real-world situations , the errors in these systems tend not to be totally random but bursty or oriented towards particular characters . finally , additional tests were performed on the routing (dissemination) function that focused on three different objectives : high precision , high recall and balanced precision-and-recall . rather than ranking all items , a binary text classification-system approach was pursued where each item is either accepted or rejected (lewis-96 , lewis-95) . adhoc manual vs automatic 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 figure 11.5 trec-1 adhoc manual versus automatic query (from trec-1

results (from trec-1 conference-proceedings , page 18 , harmon-93) insights into the advancements in information-retrieval can be gained by looking at changes in results between trecs mitigated by the changes in the test search statements . adhoc query results from trec-1 were calculated for automatic and manual query-construction . automatic query construction is based upon automatic-generation of the query from the topic fields . manual construction is also generated from the topic field manually with some machine assistance if desired . figures 11.5 shows the precision/recall results top two systems for each hmethod . the precision values were very low compared to later trecs . it also shows that there was very little difference between manual construction of a query and automatic-construction . routing (dissemination) also allowed for both an automatic and a manual-query-construction process . the generation of the query followed the same guidelines as the generation of the queries for the adhoc process . figure 11.6 shows the results from the top two manual and automatic routing systems . in this case , unlike the adhoc query process , the automatic-query-building process is better as shown by the results from the `` fund '' system . by trec-3 and trec-4 the systems were focusing on how to accommodate the shorter queries . it is clear that if the shorter queries had been executed for trec-1 , the results would have been worse than those described . figures 11.7 and 11.8 show the precision recall results for automatic and manual adhoc searches for trec-3 and trec-4 (harman-96) . the significant reduction in query size caused even the best algorithms shown in the figures to perform worse in trec-4 than in trec-3 . the systems that historically perform best at trecs (e.g. , city university , london cityal , 1nquery - inq201 , cornell university information-system evaluation 273 a o trec-3 vs trec-4 automatic 0.8 ^ 0.6 0.4

also suffered from a similar significant decrease in performance . the following is the legend to the figures : crnl ea - cornell university - smart system - vector based weighted system pircsl -

though all systems experienced significant problems when the size of the queries was reduced , a comparison between figure 11.5 and figures 11.7 and 11.8 shows a significant improvement in the precision/recall capabilities of the systems . a significant portion of this improvement occurred between trec-1 and trec-2 . by participating on a yearly basis , systems can determine the effects of changes they make and compare them with how other approaches are doing . many of the systems change their weighting and similarity-measures between trecs . inquery determined they needed better weighting formulas for long documents so they used the-city university algorithms for longer items and their own version of a probabilistic weighting-scheme for shorter items . another example of the learning from previous trecs is the cornell `` smart '' system that made major modifications to their cosine weighting-formula introducing a non-cosine length normalization technique that performs well for all lengths of documents . they also changed their expansion of a query by using the top 20 highest ranked items from a first pass to generate additional query terms for a second pass . they used 50 terms in trec-4 versus the 300 terms used in trec-3 . these changes produced significant improvements and made their technique the best in the automatic adhoc for trec-4 versus being lower in trec-3 . in the manual query method , most systems used the same search-algorithms . the difference was in how they manually generated the query . the major techniques are the automatic-generation of a query that is edited , total manual generation of the query using reference information (e.g. , online-dictionary or thesaurus) and a more complex interaction using both automatic-generation and manual expansion . when trec-introduced the more realistic short search statements , the value of previously discovered techniques had to be reevaluated . passage-retrieval (limiting the similarity-measurement to a logical subsets of the item) had a major impact in trec-3 but minimal utility in trec-4 . also more systems began making use of multiple-algorithms and selecting the best combination based upon information-system evaluation 275 characteristics of the items being searched . a lot more effort was spent on testing better ways of expanding queries (due to their short length) while limiting the expanded terms to reduce impacts on precision . the automatic techniques showed a consistent degradation from trec-3 to trec-4 . for the manual adhoc results , starting at about a level of .6 , there was minimal difference between the trecs . the routing systems are very similar to the adhoc systems . the trec-3 vs trec-4 routing comparison 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 -0.0 i ïï ¶ #

precision/recall and routing graphs . the multilingual track expanded between trec-4 and trec-5 by the introduction of chinese in addition to the previous spanish tests . the concept in trec-5 is that the algorithms being developed should be language-independent (with the exception of stemming and stopwords) . in trec-4 , the researchers who spent extra time in linguistic-work in a foreign-language showed better results (e.g. , inquery enhanced their noun-phrase identifier in their statistical thesaurus generator) . the best results in came from the university of central florida , which built an extensive synonym list . figure 11.10 shows the results of the spanish adhoc search in trec-4 . in trec-5 significant improvements in precision were made in the systems participating from trec-4 . in spanish , the precision-recall charts are better than those for the adhoc tests , but the search statements were not as constrained as in the ad-hoc . in chinese , the results varied significantly between the participants with some results worse than the adhoc and some better . this being the information-system evaluation 277 first time for chinese , it is too early to judge the overall types of performance to be expected . but for spanish , the results indicate the applicability to the developed algorithms to other languages . experiments with chinese demonstrates the applicability to a language based upon pictographs that represent words versus an alphabet_based language . the confusion track was preliminary in trec-4 . by trec-5 the test database had expanded by taking the federal register (250mbytes) , creating dvi image files and then running nist ocr programs against it . this produced approximately 5 per cent corruption typical of ocr operations . a second dataset with closer to 20 per cent corruption was produced by down-sampling the images and redoing the ocr (voorhees-96) . a set of known item topics was created by selecting items that seemed to be unique and creating a description of them . these were used and the evaluation-metric was the rank of the item in the hit file . most of the search systems used some version of n-gram-indexing (see chapter 4) . the results are too preliminary to draw any major conclusions from them . the results in trec 8 , held in november 1999 did not show any significant improvement over the best trec 3 or trec four results in this text for automatic searching . the manual searching did show some improvement because the user-interaction-techniques are improving with experience . one participant , readware , did perform significantly better than the other participants . the major change with trec 8 was the introduction of the question/answer track . the goal of the track is to encourage research into systems that return answers versus lists of documents . the user is looking for an answer to an information-need and does not want to have to browse through long items to locate the specific information of interest . the experiment was run based upon 200 fact based short answer questions . the participants returned a ranked list of up to five document-id/string location pairs for each query . the strings were limited to either 50 or 250 characters . the answers were judged based upon the proposed string including units if asked for (e.g. , world 's population) and for famous objects answers had to pertain to that specific object . most researchers processed the request using their normal search-algorithms , but included `` blind-feedback '' to increase the precision of the higher ranked hits . then techniques were used to parse the returned document around the words that caused the hit using natural-language techniques to focus on the likely strings to be returned . most of the participants only tried to return the 250-character string range . the trec-series of conferences have achieved their goal of defining a standard test forum for evaluating information-retrieval search-techniques . it provides a realistic environment with known results . it has been evolving to equate closer to a real-world operational environment that allows transition of the test results to inclusion of commercial products with known benefits . by being an open forum , it has encouraged participation by most of the major organizations developing algorithms for information-retrieval search .
