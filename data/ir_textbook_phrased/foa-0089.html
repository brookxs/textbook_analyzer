5.2.2 formal notions of similarity two features of the foa problem can help us to focus on what is known as the minkowski metric [luenberger , 1969 ; jain and dubes , 1988] . first , the result of our calculations will be a real-valued weight associating a keyword with a document or query , and we can assume that this is a continuous quantity . further , we can make the somewhat more questionable assumption that these weights make `` natural '' use of zero , and so index weights also fall on what is known as a `` ratio '' scale . with these two assumptions , the minkowski metrics are defined as : / nkw \ lll sim (q , d) = i] t \ wqk - wdk \ l 1 (5.9) where l gt ; 1 . the most common version is the 1 = 2 norm , and we will use it here . the l = 1 (`` manhattan-distance '') and l = oo (`` sup '' norm , where e ^ is replaced with max) are also seen often . a metric is a scalar function over pairs of points in the vector-space . minkowski metrics satisfy three critical properties : sim (x , y) gt ; 0 (5.10) sim (x , y) = sim (yy x) (5.11) sim (x , x) = | | x | | (5.12) gt ; arg max simix , y) (5.13) the measure sim (x , x) of a vector with itself is what we typically think of as the length of the vector , or more precisely , its norm * \ \ x \ \ . two other important features of metric-spaces follow from these axioms : 1 . sim (x , y) lt ; | | x | !
