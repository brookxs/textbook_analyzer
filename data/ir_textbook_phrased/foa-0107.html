5.5.5 linear discriminators the retrieval problem is made simpler by noting that all we really need is a simple discrimination threshold , above which the evidence for rel is sufficient that our retrieval-system elects to show a user the document as part of a hitlist . we reflect this by making the ran a : function proportional to the odds of relevance given the document : rank (x) o : ft ^ n '' * ! assuming the features x , - are stochastically independent is very helpful , but manipulating the product of terms is still awkward . for example , 174 finding out about we might reasonably want to regress (train) the feature variables against known rel documents to compute weights for their relative contributions [cooper et al. , 1992 ; gey , 1994] . while nonlinear-regression algorithms (e.g. , neural-networks) do exist , regression with respect to a linear combination-of-features is most straightforward . logarithmic functions perform just this transformation (i.e. , transforming products to sums) and are also guaranteed to be monotonic . monotonicity guarantees that if a lt ; b then log (a) lt ; log (b) gt ; and the ranking scores we use to order our hitlist will not change the relative order of any two documents on our hitlist . the two steps of ï first comparing two probabilities in an odds ratio and then ï taking logarithms to form linear-combinations rather than products arise so frequently that the two operators are often composed and conweighting sidered a single logodds calculation . ^ evidence por our discrimination purposes , then , logodds will suffice : logodds (rel \ x) = logodds (rel) + j ^ lob f '' -- ~) logodds (rel) reflects the prior-probability that we are likely to find a relevant-document in our corpus , independent of any features of the query/document . this could vary , for example , between very general and very specific queries , but again , it should not alter our ranking of documents pertaining to a particular query . focusing exclusively on those factors that will be useful in discriminating one document from another , with respect to a particular query , equation 5.52 simplifies considerably , and we come up with a rank measure : rank (x) =] p a + k (5.53) xt gqcid where the weight a associated with each feature c = log fjlzm lsm) q (l q) mathematical foundations 175 is called the relevance weight (also known as retrieval status value (rsv)) of this feature , and k is the query-invariant constant : k = logodds (rel) +] t llll (5.55) 1 q corresponding to the log of the first two document-insensitive terms of equation 5.52 .
