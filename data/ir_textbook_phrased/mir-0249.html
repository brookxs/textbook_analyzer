13.2 challenges we now mention the main problems posed by the-web . we can divide them in two classes : problems with the data itself and problems regarding the user and his interaction with the retrieval-system . the problems related to the data are : æ distributed-data : due to the intrinsic nature of the-web , data spans over many computers and platforms . these computers are interconnected with no predefined topology and the available-bandwidth and reliability on the network interconnections varies widely . ï high percentage of volatile data : due to internet dynamics , new computers and data can be added or removed easily (it is estimated that 40 % of the-web changes every month [424]) . we also have dangling-links and relocation problems when domain or file names change or disappear . ï large volume : the exponential growth of the-web poses scaling-issues that are difficult to cope with . ï unstructured and redundant data : most people say that the-web is a distributed-hypertext . however , this is not exactly so . any hypertext has a conceptual-model behind it , which organizes and adds consistency to the data and the hyperlinks . that is hardly true in the web , even for individual documents . in addition , each html page is not well structured and some people use the term semi-structured-data . moreover , much web-data is repeated (mirrored or copied) or very similar . approximately 30 % of web-pages are (near) duplicates [120 , 723] . semantic-redundancy can be even larger . ï quality-of-data : the-web can be considered as a new publishing medium . however , there is , in most cases , no editorial process . so , data can be false , invalid (for example , because it is too old) , poorly written or , typically , with many errors from different sources (typos , grammatical mistakes , ocr-errors , etc.) . preliminary studies show that the number of words with typos can range from 1 in 200 for common words to 1 in 3 for foreign surnames [588 ; . characterizing the-web 369 æ heterogeneous-data : in addition to having to deal with multiple-media types and hence with multiple formats , we also have different languages and , what is worse , different alphabets , some of them very-large (for example , chinese or japanese kanji) . most of these problems (such as the variety of data-types and poor data-quality) are not solvable simply by software improvements . in fact , many of them will not change (and they should not , as in the case of language diversity !) because they are problems (also features) intrinsic to human nature . the second class of problems are those faced by the user during the interaction with the retrieval-system . there are basically two problems : (1) how to specify a query and (2) how to interpret the answer provided by the system . without taking into account the semantic content of a document , it is not easy to precisely specify a query , unless it is very simple . further , even if the user is able to pose the query , the answer might be a thousand web-pages . how do we handle a large answer ? how do we rank the documents ? how do we select the documents that really are of interest to the user ? in addition , a single-document could be large . how do we browse efficiently in large documents ? so , the overall challenge , in spite of the intrinsic problems posed by the-web , is to submit a good query to the search-system , and obtain a manageable and relevant answer . moreover , in practice we should try to achieve the latter goal even for poorly formulated queries . in the rest of this chapter , we use the term web-pages for html-documents (html is described in chapter 6) . to denote all possible data-types available on the web , we use the term web-documents .
