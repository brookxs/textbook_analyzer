5.2.4 evaluation of relevance-feedback strategies consider the modified query-vector qm generated by the rochio formula and assume that we want to evaluate its retrieval-performance . a simplistic approach is to retrieve a set of documents using qm , to rank them using the vector formula , and to measure recall-precision figures relative to the set of relevant documents (provided by the experts) for the original query-vector q . in general , the results siiow spectacular improvements . unfortunately , a significant part of this improvement results from the higher ranks assigned to the set r of documents automatic local analysis 123 already identified as relevant during the feedback process [275] . since the user has seen these documents already (and pointed them as relevants) , such evaluation is unrealistic . further , it masks any real gains in retrieval-performance due to documents not seen by the user yet . a more realistic approach is to evaluate the retrieval-performance of the modified query-vector qm considering only the residual collection i.e. , the set of all documents minus the set of feedback documents provided by the user . because highly ranked documents are removed from the collection , the recall-precision figures for qm tend to be lower than the figures for the original query-vector q . this is not a limitation because our main purpose is to compare the performance of distinct relevance-feedback strategies (and not to compare the performance before and after feedback) . thus , as a basic rule of thumb , any experimentation involving relevance-feedback strategies should always evaluate recall-precision figures relative to the residual collection .
