1.4 the retrieval-process at this point , we are ready to detail our view of the retrieval-process . such a process is interpreted in terms of component subprocesses whose study yields many of the chapters in this book . to describe the retrieval-process , we use a simple and generic software architecture as shown in figure 1.3 . first of all , before the retrieval-process can even be initiated , it is necessary to define the text-database . this is usually done by the manager of the database , which specifies the following : (a) the documents to be used , (b) the operations to be performed on the text , and (c) the text model (i.e. , the text-structure and what elements can be retrieved) . the text operations transform the original documents and generate a logical view of them . once the logical view of the documents is defined , the database manager (using the db manager module) builds an index of the text . an index is a critical-data structure because it allows fast searching over large volumes of data . different index-structures might be used , but the most popular one is the inverted-file as indicated in figure 1.3 . the resources (time and storage space) spent on defining the text-database and building the index are amortized by querying the retrieval-system many times . given that the document database is indexed , the retrieval-process can be initiated . the user first specifies a user-need which is then parsed and transformed by the same text operations applied to the text . then , query-operations might be applied before the actual query , which provides a system-representation for the user-need , is generated . the query is then processed to obtain the retrieved documents . fast-query processing is made possible by the index-structure previously built . before been sent to the user , the retrieved documents are ranked according to a likelihood of relevance . the user then examines the set of ranked documents in the search for useful information . at this point , he might pinpoint a subset of the documents seen as definitely of interest and initiate a user-feedback cycle . in such a cycle , the system uses the documents selected by the user to change the query-formulation . hopefully , this modified query is a better representation 10 introduction user-need user-interface text 4 , 10 text text operations user-feedback logical view logical view query-operations query 6,7 indexing db manager module inverted-file searching retrieved docs index ranked docs ranking text-database figure 1.3 the process of retrieving information (the numbers beside each box indicate the chapters that cover the corresponding topic) . of the real user-need . the small numbers outside the lower right corner of various boxes in figure 1.3 indicate the chapters in this book which discuss the respective subpro-cesses in detail a brief introduction to each of these chapters can be found in section 1.5 . consider now the user-interfaces available with current information-retrieval-systems (including web-search-engines and web-browsers) . we first notice that the user almost never declares his information-need . instead , he is required to provide a direct representation for the query that the system will execute . since most users have no knowledge of text and query-operations , the query they provide is frequently inadequate . therefore , it is not surprising to observe that poorly formulated queries lead to poor retrieval (as happens so often on the web) .
