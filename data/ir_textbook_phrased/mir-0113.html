6.5.4 hytime the hypermedia/time-based structuring language {hytime) is a standard (iso/iec 10744) defined for multimedia-documents markup . hytime is an sgml architecture that specifies the generic hypermedia-structure of documents . 160 text and multimedia languages and properties following the guiding principle of sgml , hytime-defined structure is independent of any presentation of the encoded document . as an architecture , hytime allows dtds to be written for individual document-models that use hytime constructs , specifying how these document-sets tailor the composition of these constructs for their particular representational needs . the standard also provides several metadtds , facilitating the design of new multimedia markup-languages . the hypermedia concepts directly represented by hytime include ï complex locating of document objects , ï relationships (hyperlinks) between document objects , and ï numeric , measured associations between document objects . the hytime architecture has three parts : the base linking and addressing architecture , the scheduling architecture (derived from the base architecture) , and the rendition architecture (which is an application of the scheduling architecture) . the base architecture addresses the syntax-and-semantics of hyperlinks . for most simple hypermedia presentations , this should be enough . the scheduling module of hytime defines the abstract-representation of arbitrarily complex hypermedia structures , including music and interactive presentations . its basic mechanism is a simple one : the sequencing of object containers along axes measured in temporal or spatial units . the rendition module is essentially an application of the scheduling architecture that defines a general mechanism for defining the creation of new schedules from existing schedules by applying special `` rendition rules ' of different types . hytime does not directly specify graphical-interfaces , user-navigation , user-interaction , or the placement of media on time lines and screen displays . these aspects of document-processing are rendered from the hytime constructs in a manner specified by mechanisms such as style-sheets , as is done with sgml documents . one application of hytime , is the standard music description-language (smdigital library) . sdml is an architecture for the representation of music-information , either alone , or in conjunction with other media , also supporting multimedia time sequencing information . another application is the metafile for interactive-documents (mid) . mid is a common interchange structure , based on sgml and hytime . that takes data from various authoring-systems and structures it for display on dissimilar presentation-systems , with minimal human-intervention .
