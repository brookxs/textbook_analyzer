a normalised symmetric difference let us now return to basics and consider how it is that users could simply measure retrieval-effectiveness . we are considering the common situation where a set of documents is retrieved in response to a query , the possible ordering of this set is ignored . ideally the set should consist only of documents relevant to the request , that is giving 100 per cent precision and 100 per cent recall (and by implication 0 per cent fallout) . in practice , however , this is rarely the case , and the retrieved set consists of both relevant and non-relevant documents . the situation may therefore be pictured as shown in figure 7.11 , where a is the set of relevant documents , b the set of retrieved documents , and a [[intersection]] b the set of retrieved documents which are relevant . now , an intuitive way of measuring the adequacy of the retrieved set is to measure the size of the shaded area . or to put it differently , to measure to what extent the two sets do not match . the area is in fact the symmetric difference : a [[delta]] b (or a [[union]] b - a [[intersection]] b) . since we are more interested in the proportion (rather than absolute number) of relevant and non-relevant documents retrieved , we need to normalise this measure . a simple normalisation gives : which is a simple composite measure . the preceding argument in itself is not sufficient to justify the use of this particular composite measure . however , i shall now introduce a framework within which a general measure may be derived which among others has e as one of its special cases .
