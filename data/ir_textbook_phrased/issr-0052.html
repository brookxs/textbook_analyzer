4.2.2 porter-stemming algorithm the porter algorithm is based upon a set of conditions of the stem , suffix and prefix and associated actions given the condition . some examples of stem conditions are : 1 . the measure , m , of a stem is a function of sequences of vowels (a , e , i , o , u , y) followed by a consonant . if v is a sequence of vowels and c is a sequence of consonants , then m is : c (vc) mv 76 chapter 4 where the initial c and final v are optional and m is the number vc repeats . measure example rn = 0 free , why m = l frees , whose m = 2 prologue , compute 2 . * lt ; xgt ; - stem ends with letter x 3 . * v * - stem contains a vowel 4 . * d - stem ends in double consonant 5 . * o - stem ends with consonant-vowel-consonant sequence where the final consonant is not w , x , or y suffix conditions take the form current_suffix = = pattern actions are in the form old_suffix - gt ; new_suffix rules are divided into steps to define the order of applying the rules . the following are some examples of the rules : step condition suffix la 1b ibl1 1c 2 3 4 5a 5b null * v * null * v * mgt ; 0 mgt ; 0 mgt ; l and and * lt ; lgt ; * d sses ing at y aliti icate able e null replacement example ss stresses-gt ; stress null making-gt ; mak ate inflat (ed) - gt ; inflate i happy-gt ; happi al formaliti-gt ; formal ic duplicate-gt ; duplic null adjustable-gt ; adjust null inflate-gt ; inflat single letter control l-gt ; control given process the word `` duplicatable , '' the following are the steps in the stemming dupsicat rule 4 duplicate rule ibi duplic rule 3 1 ibl rules are expansion rules to make correction to stems for proper conflation . for example stemming of skies drops the es , making it ski , which is the wrong concept and the i should be changed to y. data-structure 77 the application of another rule in step 4 , removing `` ic , '' can not be applied since only one rule from each step is allowed be applied .
