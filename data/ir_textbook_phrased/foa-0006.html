overview 11 1.2.2 topical scope the first constraint we can apply to the set of keywords we will allow in our vocabulary is to define a domain of discourse - the subject area within which each and every user of our search-engine is assumed to be searching . while we might imagine building a truly encyclopedic reference work , one capable of answering questions about any topic whatsoever , it is much more common to build a search-engine with more limited goals , capable of answering questions about some particular subject . we will choose the simpler path (it will prove enough of a challenge !) and focus on a particular topic . to be concrete , throughout this text we will assume that the domain of discourse is artificial-intelligence (ai) . briefly , ai can be defined as a subdiscipline of computer-science , especially concerned with algorithms that mimic inferences which , had they been made by a human , would be considered `` intelligent . '' it typically includes such topics as knowledge-representation , machine-learning , and robotics . thus computer-science is a broader term than artificial-intelligence . this hypernym relationship between the two phrases is something we will return to later (cf. section 6.3) . for example , our task becomes more difficult if we assume that the corpus of documents contains material on the broader topic of computer-science , rather than just (!) artificial-intelligence . conversely , the topics knowledge-representation , machine-learning , and robotics are all narrower terms , and our task would , caeteris parihus , * be made easier if we only had to help users foa one of them . constraining the vocabulary so that it is exhaustive enough that any imaginable and relevant topic is expressible within the language , while remaining specific enough that any particular subjects a user is likely to investigate can be distinguished from others , will become a central goal of our design . robotics , for example , would seem a descriptive keyword because it identifies a relatively small subarea of artificial-intelligence . computer-science would be silly as a keyword (for this corpus) , because we are assuming it would apply to every document and hence does nothing to discriminate them - it is too exhaustive . at the * (assuming) all other things are equal . 12 finding out about other extreme , robotic vacuum cleaners for 747 airliners is almost certainly too specific . the vocabulary-size - the total number of keywords - depends on many factors , including the scope of the domain of discourse . a typical language user has a reading vocabulary of approximately 50,000 words . web-search-engines and large test corpora formed from the union of many document types may require vocabularies ten times this size . it is unlikely that such a large lexicon of keywords would be required for restricted corpora , but it is also true that even a narrow field can develop an extensive , specialized jargon or terms of art . in practice , search-engines typically have difficulty reducing the number of usable keywords to much below 10,000 .
