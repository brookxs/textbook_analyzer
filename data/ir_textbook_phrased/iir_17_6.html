divisive clustering top-down-clustering divisive clustering top-down-clustering is conceptually more complex than bottom-up-clustering since we need a second , flat clustering-algorithm as a `` subroutine '' . it has the advantage of being more efficient if we do not generate a complete hierarchy all the way down to individual document leaves . for a fixed number of top levels , using an efficient flat algorithm like - means , top-down algorithms are linear in the number of documents and clusters . so they run much faster than hac algorithms , which are at least quadratic . there is evidence that divisive algorithms produce more accurate hierarchies than bottom-up algorithms in some circumstances . see the references on bisecting - means in section 17.9 . bottom-up-methods make clustering decisions based on local-patterns without initially taking into account the global distribution . these early decisions can not be undone . top-down-clustering benefits from complete information about the global distribution when making top-level partitioning decisions .
