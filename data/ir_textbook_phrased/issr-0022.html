2.1.8 natural-language queries rather than having the user enter a specific boolean-query by specifying search-terms and the logic between them , natural-language queries allow a user to enter a prose statement that describes the information that the user wants to find . the longer the prose , the more accurate the results returned . the most difficult logic case associated with natural-language queries is the ability to specify negation in the search statement and have the system recognize it as negation . the system searches and finds those items most like the query statement entered . the techniques for locating items similar to the search statement (described in chapters 5 and 7) are suited for finding items like other items but do not have inherent techniques to exclude items that are like a certain portion of the search statement . for many users , this type of an-interface provides a natural extension to asking someone to perform a search . in this case the discourse is with the computer . an example of a natural-language-query is : find for me all the items that discuss oil reserves and current attempts to find new oil reserves . include any items that discuss the international financial aspects of the oil production-process . do not include items about the oil-industry in the united-states . the way a system uses this input for a search is described in chapter 7 . the problem with many techniques and systems is to understand the negation concept of excluding items about the oil-industry in the united-states . when this capability has been made available , users have a tendency to enter sentence fragments that reflect their search need rather than complete sentences . this is predictable because the users want to minimize use of the human-resource (their time) . the likely input for the above example is : oil reserves and attempts to find new oil reserves , international financial aspects of oil production , not united-states oil-industry information-retrieval-system capabilities 37 this usage pattern is important because sentence fragments make morphological-analysis of the natural-language-query difficult and may limit the system 's ability to perform term disambiguation (e.g. , understand which meaning of a word is meant) . using the same search statement , a boolean-query attempting to find the same information might appear : (`` locate '' and `` new '' and `` oil reserves '') or (`` international '' and `` financ * '' and `` oil production '') not (`` oil-industry '' and `` united-states '') associated with natural-language queries is a function called relevance-feedback . the natural-language does not have to be input by the user but just identified by the user . this introduces the concept of finding items that `` are like '' other items . thus a user could identify a particular item (s) in the database or text-segments within item (s) and use that as the search statement . this is discussed in detail in chapter 7 . to accommodate the negation function and provide users with a transition to the natural-language-systems , most commercial systems have a user-interface that provides both a natural-language and boolean-logic capability . negation is handled by the boolean portion of a search . the integration of these two search statement types has not been achieved in information-retrieval-systems . natural-language-interfaces improve the recall of systems with a decrease in precision when negation is required .
