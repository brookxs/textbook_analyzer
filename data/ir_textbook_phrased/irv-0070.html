2 . calculation of mst there are numerous published algorithms for generating an mst from pairwise association measures , the most efficient probably being the recent one due to whitney [21] . the time dependence of his algorithm is 0 (n [2]) where n is the number of index-terms to be fitted into the tree . this is not a barrier to its use on large-data-sets , for it is easy to partition the data by some coarse clustering-technique as recommended on p. 59 , after which the total spanning-tree can be generated by applying the mst-algorithm to each cluster of index-terms in turn . this will reduce the time dependence from 0 (n [2]) to 0 (k [2]) where k lt ; lt ; n . it is along these lines that bentley and friedman [22] have shown that by exploiting the geometry of the space in which the index-terms are points the computation-time for generating the mst can be shown to be almost always 0 (n log n) . moreover if one is prepared to accept a spanning-tree which is almost an mst then a computation-time of 0 (n log n) is guaranteed . one major inefficiency in generating the mst is of course due to the fact that all n (n-1) / 2 associations are computed whereas only a small number are in fact significant in the sense that they are non-zero and could therefore be chosen for a weight of an edge in the spanning-tree . however , a high proportion are zero and could safely be omitted . unfortunately , the only way we can ignore them is to first compute them . croft [23] in a recent design for the single-link algorithm has discovered a way of ignoring associations without first computing them . it does however presuppose that a file and its inverted form are available , so that if this is not so some computation-time would need to be invested in the inversion . it may be that a similar algorithm could be devised for computing an mst .
