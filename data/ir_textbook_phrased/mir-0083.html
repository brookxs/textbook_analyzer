5.1 introduction without detailed knowledge of the collection make-up and of the retrieval environment , most users find it difficult to formulate queries which are well designed for retrieval purposes . in fact , as observed with web-search-engines , the users might need to spend large amounts of time reformulating their queries to accomplish effective retrieval . this difficulty suggests that the first query-formulation should be treated as an initial (naive) attempt to retrieve relevant-information . following that , the documents initially retrieved could be examined for relevance and new improved query formulations could then be constructed in the hope of retrieving additional useful documents . such query-reformulation involves two basic steps : expanding the original query with new terms and reweighting the terms in the expanded query . in this chapter , we examine a variety of approaches for improving the initial query formulation through query-expansion and term reweighting . these approaches are grouped in three categories : (a) approaches based on feedback information from the user ; (b) approaches based on information derived from the set of documents initially retrieved (called the local set of documents) ; and (c) approaches based on global information derived from the document collection . in the first category , user-relevance-feedback methods for the vector and probabilistic-models are discussed . in the second category , two approaches for local analysis (i.e. , analysis based on the set of documents initially retrieved) are presented . in the third category , two approaches for global-analysis are covered . our discussion is not aimed at completely covering the area , neither does it intend to present an exhaustive survey of query-operations . instead , our discussion is based on a selected bibliography which , we believe , is broad enough to allow an overview of the main issues and tradeoffs involved in query-operations . local and global-analysis are highly dependent on clustering-algorithms . thus , clustering is covered throughout our discussion . however , there is no intention of providing a complete survey of clustering-algorithms for information-retrieval . 117 118 query-operations
