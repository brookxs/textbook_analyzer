3 cataloging and indexing 3.1 history and objectives of indexing 3.2 indexing process 3.3 automatic-indexing 3.4 information-extraction 3.5 summary the first two chapters of this book presented the architecture of a total information-storage-and-retrieval system and the basic functions that apply to it . one of the most critical-aspects of an information-system that determines its effectiveness is how it represents concepts in items . the transformation from the received item to the searchable data-structure is called indexing , this process can be manual or automatic , creating the basis for direct-search of items in the document-database or indirect search via index-files . rather than trying to create a searchable data-structure that directly maps to the text in the input items , some systems transform the item into a completely different representation that is concept based and use this as the searchable data-structure . the concept weighting-schemes have demonstrated the capability to find items that the traditional weighted-and non-weighted data-structures have missed . systems that use a specialized-hardware text-search processor do not require the searchable data-structure , but search the original standardized documents (see chapter 9) . once the searchable data-structure has been created , techniques must be defined that correlate the user-entered query statement to the set of items in the database to determine the items to be returned to the user . this process is called search and is often different between searches applied to the document database (called ad-hoc queries) and searches against incoming items to determine the mail file (s) the item should be delivered to (called dissemination searches) . in the newer systems a by-product of the search-process is a relative value for each item 52 chapter 3 with respect to its correlation to the query constraints . this value is used in ranking the item . in some cases a simplified ranking-algorithm is applied to the items found from the search-process after it is completed . closely associated with the indexing process is the information-extraction process . its goal is to extract specific information to be normalized and entered into a structured database (dbms) . it is similar to the process of creating the search structure for an item in that both must locate concepts in the item . information-extraction differs because it focuses on very specific concepts and contains a transformation process that modifies the extracted information into a form compatible with the end structured database . this process was referred to in chapter 2 as automatic file build . another way information-extraction can be used is in the generation of a summary of an item . the emphasis changes from extracting facts to go into index fields to extracting larger contextual constructs (e.g. , sentences) that are combined to form a summary of an item .
