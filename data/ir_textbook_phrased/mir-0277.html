14.2.1 databases the history of commercial online retrieval-systems begins with the creation of databases of bibliographic-information in electronic-form . in fact , neufeld and cornog claim ` databases can almost be said to have created the information-industry as we now know it ' [600] . abstracting and indexing tools in printed form were available in the nineteenth century and became increasingly available in the twentieth century . professional-organizations , commercial firms , and government bodies served as publishers , selecting relevant materials from the world 's literature , creating bibliographic-records for them , and providing abstracts and indexing information . these databases were concentrated in the sciences , with titles such as chemical abstracts , biological abstracts , and engineering index , but humanities (historical abstracts) and social-sciences (psycinfo) products soon became available . as publishers of abstracts and indexes turned to computer-assisted typesetting and printing for their products , the resulting magnetic tapes of information began to be used for information-retrieval purposes . today virtually all print abstracting and indexing products are also available in electronic-form , and many new products are available solely in electronic-form , without a print equivalent . as storage costs have dropped dramatically , many of these electronic databases 400 libraries and bibliographical systems ï the dialog corporation dialog , ` the world 's largest online-information company , ' contains about 500 databases covering a full range of subjects , including science , technology and medicine , humanities , business , and electronic newspapers . bibliographic-and-full-text-databases are included . some databases are also available in cd-rom versions for onsite searching . url : http://www.dialog.com ï lexis-nexis lexis-nexis markets full-text databases to the legal and business community . lexis provides access to 4800 legal-research products including state and federal case-law , statutes , and regulations . nexis covers over 18,000 news and business sources . url : http://www.lexis-nexis.com ï oclc oclc (the online computer library center , inc.) , which began as a bibliographic utility for cooperative cataloging of library materials , now offers access to over 70 databases and 1.5 million full-text articles . features include an-interface oriented to end-users and links to documents as well as to an inter-library loan module . url : http://www.oclc . org/oclc/memi / f s.html ï h.w. wilson h.w. wilson began producing print indexes in 1898 , and now offers 40 databases to the public , school , and college library market . wilson has electronic , cd-rom , magnetic tape , and web-based versions of its databases . url : http : / / www . hwwilson . com/default . htm figure 14.2 profiles of database vendors . have expanded to include not only bibliographic-information about documents , but the text of the documents themselves . these are referred to as full-text databases , and include databases of journal-articles and newspapers as well as reference materials such as encyclopedias and directories . characteristics of some common databases (as available on dialog) are given in figure 14.3 . databases and indexing in general , bibliographic-databases are expensive to produce , because they require rigorous selection and analysis of the documents that they cover . some databases cover materials in a specific group of journals , others attempt to be comprehensive , collecting the world 's literature within the defined subject scope . every item must be examined for relevance to the database 's goals , indexed , online ir systems and document-databases 401 æ ca search : chemical abstracts coverage : bibliographical records for worldwide literature of chemistry and its-applications file-size : 14 million records ;
