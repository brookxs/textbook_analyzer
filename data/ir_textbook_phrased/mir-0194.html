10.5.3 faceted queries yet another problem with boolean-queries is that their strict interpretation tends to yield result sets that are either too large , because the user includes many terms in a disjunct , or are empty , because the user conjoins terms in an effort to reduce the result-set . this problem occurs in large part because the user does not know the contents of the collection or the role of terms within the collection . a common strategy for dealing with this problem , employed in systems with command-line-based interfaces like dialog 's , is to create a series of short queries , view the number of documents returned for each , and combine those queries that produce a reasonable number of results . for example , in dialog , each query produces a resulting set of documents that is assigned an identifying name . rather than returning a list of titles themselves , dialog shows the set number with a listing of the number of matched documents . titles can be shown by specifying the set number and issuing a command to show the titles . document-sets that are not empty can be referred to by a set name and combined with and operations to produce new sets . if this set in turn is too small , the user can back up and try a different combination of sets , and this process is repeated in pursuit of producing a reasonably sized document-set . this kind of query-formulation is often called a faceted query , to indicate that the user 's query is divided into topics or facets , each of which should be 282 user-interfaces and visualization present in the retrieved documents [553 , 348] . for example , a query on drugs for the prevention of osteoporosis might consist of three facets , indicated by the disjuncts (osteoporosis or ` bone loss ') (drugs or pharmaceuticals) (prevention or cure) this query implies that the user would like to view documents that contain all three topics . a technique to impose an ordering on the results of boolean-queries is what is known as post-coordinate or quorum-level ranking [700 , ch . 8] . in this approach , documents are ranked according to the size of the subset of the query terms they contain . so given a query consisting of ` cats , ' ` dogs , ' ` fish , ' and ` mice / the system would rank a document with at least one instance of ` cats / wdogs / and ` fish1 higher than a document containing 30 occurrences of ` cats ' but no occurrences of the other terms . combining faceted queries with quorum ranking yields a situation intermediate between full boolean syntax and free-form natural-language queries . an-interface for specifying this kind of interaction can consist of a list of entry lines . the user enters one topic per entry line , where each topic consists of a list of semantically related terms that are combined in a disjunct . documents that contain at least one term from each facet are ranked higher than documents containing terms only from one or a few facets . this helps ensure that documents which contain discussions of several of the user 's topics are ranked higher than those that contain only one topic . by only requiring that one term from each facet be matched , the user can specify the same concept in several different ways in the hopes of increasing the likelihood of a match . if combined with graphical feedback about which subsets of terms matched the document , the user can see the results of a quorum ranking by topic rather than by word . section 10.6 describes the tilebars interface which provides this type of feedback . tiiis idea can be extended yet another step by allowing users to weight each facet . more likely to be readily usable , however , is a default weighting in which the facet listed highest is assigned the most weight , the second facet is assigned less weight , and so on , according to some distribution over weights .
