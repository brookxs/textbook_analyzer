14.3.2 opacs and end-users probably the greatest challenge for designers of opacs is to create usable-systems . opacs are found in every type of library , and while users of research libraries might be expected to be knowledgeable about library practices in organizing and accessing information , elsewhere the end-user could as easily be a schoolchild , college undergraduate , or patron of a local public library with little or no formal training in library use (what borgman calls ` perpetual novices ' [105]) . the underlying record structure (the marc record) is detailed and complex , and the organizational-structures (lcsh , lc classification-scheme) are far from intuitive . the most common type of searching in opacs is subject-searching , and failures by users in topical searching are well documented [484] . common failures are null sets (` zero results ') , or at the other extreme , information-overload in which more references are retrieved than can easily be examined [484] . according to one study of transaction-logs for the melvyl catalog [252] , 82 % of in-library users had a zero retrieval for one or more searches . interestingly , over 25 % of users continued their search through ten or more tries , and another 25 % did not appear to retrieve any useful information . writing in 1986 , borgman [104] raised the question , ` why are online catalogs hard to use ? / and in 1996 , revisited the problem with kwhy are online catalogs still hard to use ? ' [105] . she argues the reason is that they do not incorporate knowledge about user-behavior , and place too heavy a burden on the searcher for query-specification . greater contextual assistance for searchers has been suggested by a number of researchers [105 , 252 , 371] .
