7.2 building hypotheses about documents we will talk about competing `` hypotheses / ' for example , rules that successfully separate our spam-email from our family 's email . if only very simple hypotheses are to be considered , a relatively small amount of data adaptive-information-retrieval 259 can be used to select between them . for example , if our hypothesis is that spam-email always contains the phrase $ $ $ $ big money $ $ $ $ $ , a small amount of training-data is sufficient to confirm or disconfirm this rule [sahami et al. , 1998] . but if we wish to consider elaborate discrimination rules , for example , including many keywords and/or date information , it takes much more data to tease apart all the alternatives . the volume of training-data available , then , provides a very real constraint on how complex the hypotheses we can consider can be and how statistically reliable we expect rules to perform on unseen test-data .
