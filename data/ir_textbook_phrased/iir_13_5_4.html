feature-selection for multiple-classifiers more commonly , feature-selection statistics are first computed separately for each class on the two-class-classification task versus and then combined . one combination method computes a single figure-of-merit for each feature , for example , by averaging the values for feature , and then selects the features with highest figures of merit . another frequently used combination method selects the top features for each of classifiers and then combines these sets into one global-feature set . classification-accuracy often decreases when selecting common features for a system with classifiers as opposed to different sets of size . but even if it does , the gain in efficiency owing to a common document-representation may be worth the loss in accuracy .
