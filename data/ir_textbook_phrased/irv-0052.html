serial-search although serial searches are acknowledge to be slow , they are frequently still used as parts of larger systems . they also provide a convenient demonstration of the use of matching-functions . suppose there are n documents di in the system , then the serial-search proceeds by calculating n values m (q , di) the set of documents to be retrieved is determined . there are two ways of doing this : (1) the matching-function is given a suitable threshold , retrieving the documents above the threshold and discarding the ones below . if t is the threshold , then the retrieved set b is the set {di | m (q , di) gt ; t} . (2) the documents are ranked in increasing order of matching-function value . a rank position r is chosen as cut-off and all documents below the rank are retrieved so that b = {di | r (i) lt ; r} where r (i) is the rank position assigned to di . the hope in each case is that the relevant documents are contained in the retrieved set . the main difficulty with this kind of search-strategy is the specification of the threshold or cut-off . it will always be arbitrary since there is no way of telling in advance what value for each query will produce the best retrieval .
