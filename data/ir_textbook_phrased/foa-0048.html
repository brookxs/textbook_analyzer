3.3.5 weighting the index relation the simplest notion of an index is binary - either a keyword is associated with a document or it is not . but it is natural to imagine degrees of about-ness . we will capture this strength of association with a single real number , a weight , capturing the strength of the relationship between keyword and document . this weight can be used in two different ways . the first is to reduce the number of links to only the most significant relationships , those with the highest weights . in this respect a weighted indexing system is a more general formulation than a binary formulation ; we can always go to a binary-relation from the weighted one . this might make weights useful even if our retrieval-method is boolean (as it often was in early information-retrieval (ir) systems) . but a second and today more common reason for using a weighted indexing relation is that the retrieval-method can exploit these weights directly . 82 finding out about one way to describe what this number means is probabilistic : we seek a measure of a document 's relevance , conditionalized on the belief that a keyword is relevant : wkd c * ? r (^ relevant | k relevant) (3.10) note that this is a directed relation ; we may or may not believe that the symmetric relation wdk âˆž ^ pr (^ relevant | d relevant) (3.11) should be the same . unless otherwise specified , when we refer to a weight w we will intend it to mean wkd in order to compute statistical estimates for such probabilities we define several important quantities : fkd = number of occurrences of keyword k in document d fk = total number of occurrences of keyword k across entire corpus djfc = number of documents containing keyword k (3.12) we will make two demands on the weight reflecting the degree to which a document is about a particular keyword or topic . the first one goes back to luhn 's central observation [luhn , 1961] : repetition is an indication of emphasis . if an author uses a word frequently , it is because he or she thinks it 's important . define fkd to be the number of occurrences of keyword k in a document d . our second concern is that a keyword be a useful discriminator within the context of the corpus . capturing this notion of corpus-context statistically proves much more difficult ; for now , we simply give it the name discrim ^ . because we care about both , we will devise our weight to be the product of the two factors , corresponding to their conjunction : u * kd oc fkd ' discrimk (3.13) we will now consider several different index weighting-schemes that have been suggested over the years . these all share the same reliance on f ^ as a measure of keyword importance within the document and the same product-form as equation 3.13 . what they do not share weighting and matching against indices 83 is how best to quantify the discrimination power discrintk of the keyword .
