9.2.1 introduction we can approach the development of parallel-information-retrieval algorithms from two different directions . one possibility is to develop new retrieval-strategies that directly lend themselves to parallel-implementation . for example , a text-search procedure can be built on top of a neural-network . neural-networks (see chapter 2) are modeled after the human-brain and solve problems using a large number of nodes (neurons) , each of which has a set of inputs , a threshold , and an output . the output of one node is connected to the input of one or more other nodes , with the boundaries of the network defining the initial input and final output of the system . a node 's output value is determined by a weighted function of the node 's inputs and threshold . a training-procedure is used to learn appropriate settings for the weights and thresholds in the network . computation proceeds by applying input values to the network , computing each active node 's output value , and conditioning these values through the network until the final output values are obtained . neural-networks naturally lend themselves to parallel-implementation on simd hardware . the challenge with this approach is to parallel ir 233 define the retrieval-task in such a way that it maps well onto the computational paradigm . the other possibility is to adapt existing , well studied information-retrieval algorithms to parallel-processing . this is the approach that we will consider throughout the rest of this chapter . the modifications required to adapt an existing algorithm to parallel-implementation depend on the target parallel platform . we will investigate techniques for applying a number of retrieval algorithms to both mimd and simd architectures . since parallel-information-retrieval is still very much an active research area , few approaches have fallen out as accepted standard techniques . we will , therefore , present a sampling of the work that has been done and avoid preferring one technique over another .
