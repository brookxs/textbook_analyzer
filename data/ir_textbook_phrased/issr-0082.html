5.3.2 natural-language-processing section 5.3.1 discussed generation of term phrases as indexes . lexical-analysis determining verb tense , plurality and part-of-speech is assumed to have been completed prior to the following additional processing . natural-language-processing not only produces more accurate term phrases , but can provide higher level semantic-information identifying relationships between concepts . the dr-link system (liddy-93) and its commercial implementation via textwise system adds the functional processes relationship concept detectors , conceptual-graph generators and conceptual-graph matchers that generate higher level linguistic relationships including semantic and discourse-level relationships . this system is representative of natural-language_based processing systems . during the first phase of this approach , the processing tokens in the document are mapped to subject codes as defined by the codes in the longman 's automatic-indexing 129 dictionary of common english (ldoce) . disambiguation uses a priori statistical term-relationships and the ordering of the subject codes in the ldoce , which indicates most likely assignment of a term to a code . these codes equate to index term assignment and have some similarities to the concept-based systems discussed in section 5.4 . the next phase is called the text structurer , which attempts to identify general discourse-level areas within an item . thus a news story may be subdivided into areas associated with evaluation (opinions) , main event (basic facts) , and expectations (predictions) . these have been updated to include analytical information , cause/effect dimension and attributed quotations in the more recent versions of dr-link (see http://199.100.962 on the internet) . these areas can then be assigned higher weighting if the user includes `` preference '' in a search statement . the system also attempts to determine topic-statement identifiers . natural-language-processing is not just determining the topic-statement (s) but also assigning semantic-attributes to the topic such as time frame (past , present , future) . to perform this type-analysis , a general-model of the predicted text is needed . for example , news-items likely follow a model proposed by van dijk (dijk-88) . liddy reorganized this structure into a news schema components consisting of circumstance , consequence , credentials , definition , error , evaluation , expectation , history , lead , main event , no comment , previous event , references and verbal reaction . each sentence is evaluated and assigned weights associated with its possible inclusion in the different components . thus , if a query is oriented toward a future activity , then , in addition to the subject code vector mapping , it would weight higher terms associated with the expectation component . the next level of semantic-processing is the assignment of terms to components , classifying the intent of the terms in the text and identifying the topical statements . the next level of natural-language-processing identifies interrelationships between the concepts . for example , there may be two topics within an item `` national elections '' and `` guerrilla warfare . '' the relationship `` as a result of is critical to link the order of these two concepts . this process clarifies if the elections were caused by the warfare or the warfare caused by the elections . significant information is lost by not including the connector relationships . these types of linkages are generated by general linguistic cues (words in text) that are fairly general and domain-independent . the final step is to assign final weights to the established relationships . the relationships are typically envisioned as triples with two concepts and a relationship between them . although all relationships are possible , constructing a system requires the selection of a subset of possible relationships and the rules to locate the relationships . the weights are based upon a combination of statistical-information and values assigned to the actual words used in establishing the linkages . passive verbs would receive less weight than active verbs . the additional-information beyond the indexing is kept in additional data-structures associated with each item . this information is used whenever it is implicitly included in a search statement that is natural-language based or explicitly requested by the user .
