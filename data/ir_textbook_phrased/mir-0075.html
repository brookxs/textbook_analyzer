4.4 structural qyeries up to now we have considered the text-collection as a set of documents which can be queried with regard to their text-content . this model is unable to take advantage of novel text-features which are becoming commonplace , such as the (a) structural queries (c) 107 figure 4.2 the three main structures : (a) form-like fixed structure , (6) hypertext-structure , and (c) hierarchical-structure . text-structure . the text-collections tend to have some structure built into them , and allowing the user to query those texts based on their structure (and not only their content) is becoming attractive . the standardization of languages to represent structured texts such as html has pushed forward in this direction (see chapter 6) . as discussed in chapter 2 , mixing contents and structure in queries allows us to pose very powerful queries , which are much more expressive than each query mechanism by itself . by using a query-language that integrates both types of queries , the retrieval quality of textual-databases can be improved . this mechanism is built on top of the basic queries , so that they select a set of documents that satisfy certain constraints on their content (expressed using words , phrases , or patterns that the documents must contain) . on top of this , some structural constraints can be expressed using containment , proximity , or other restrictions on the structural elements (e.g. , chapters , sections , etc.) present in the documents . the boolean-queries can be built on top of the structural queries , so that they combine the sets of documents delivered by those queries . in the boolean syntax-tree (recall the example of figure 4.1) the structural queries form the leaves of the tree . on the other hand , structural queries can themselves have a complex syntax . we divide this section according to the type of structures found in text-databases . figure 4.2 illustrates them . although structured-query languages should be amenable for ranking , this is still an open problem . in what follows it is important to distinguish the difference between the structure that a text may have and what can be queried about that structure . in general , natural-language-texts may have any desired structure . however , different models allow the querying of only some aspects of the real structure . when we say that the structure allowed is restricted in some way , we mean that only the aspects which follow this restriction can be queried , albeit the text may have more structural-information . for instance , it is possible that an article has a nested structure of sections and subsections , but the query-model does not accept recursive structures . in this case we will not be able to query for sections included in others , although this may be the case in the texts documents under consideration . 108 query-languages
