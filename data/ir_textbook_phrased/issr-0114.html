9 text-search algorithms 9.1 introduction to text-search techniques 9.2 software text-search algorithms 9.3 hardware text-search systems three classical text-retrieval techniques have been defined for organizing items in a textual database , for rapidly identifying the relevant items and for eliminating items that do not satisfy the search . the techniques are full text scanning (streaming) , word inversion and multiattribute retrieval (faloutsos-85 , salton-83) . in addition to using the indexes as a mechanism for searching text in information-systems , streaming of text was frequently found in the systems as an additional search-mechanism . in addition to completing a query , it is frequently used to highlight the search-terms in the retrieved item prior to display . in the earlier history-of-information systems , where the hardware (cpu , memory and disk systems) were limiters in performance , specialized-hardware text-search systems were created . the were used to offload the search-process from the main computer leaving the user-interface , access and display . if there is a requirement for a system to be able to accurately search for the complete set of search-terms , then streaming will be required as a final step . the need for hardware text-search streamers has been declining with the increases in cpu-power , disk access and memory . but there is still a market for it in the areas of genetic research and many existing legacy-systems in use .
