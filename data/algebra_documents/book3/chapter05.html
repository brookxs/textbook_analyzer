<h2><a name="_Toc535933515"><span style="font-variant: normal; text-transform: uppercase; font-style: normal;">The Solutions of a System of
Equations</span></a></h2>

<p>A system of equations refers to a number of equations with an equal number
of variables. We will only look at the case of two linear equations in two
unknowns. The situation gets much more complex as the number of unknowns
increases, and larger systems are commonly attacked with the aid of a computer.</p>

<p>A system of two linear equations in two unknowns might look like</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><sub><img src="solution_set_files/image002.gif" height="48" width="87"></sub></p>

<p>This is the standard form for writing equations when they are part of a
system of equations: the variables go in order on the left side and the
constant term is on the right. The bracket on the left indicates that the two
equations are intended to be solved simultaneously, but it is not always used.</p>

<p>When we talk about the <i>solution</i> of this system of equations, we mean
the values of the variables that make both equations true at the same time.
There may be many pairs of <i>x</i> and <i>y </i>that make the first equation
true, and many pairs of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> that make the second equation
true, but we are looking for an <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> that would work in <i>both</i>
equations. In the following pages we will look at algebraic methods for finding
this solution, if it exists.</p>

<p>Because these are linear equations, their graphs will be straight lines.
This can help us visualize the situation graphically. There are three
possibilities:</p>


<div class="section" title="1. Independent Equations">
<h3><a name="_Toc535568983">1. Independent Equations</a></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol; color: black;">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b><i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Lines
intersect</span></i></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol; color: black;">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b><i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">One
solution</span></i></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><img src="solution_set_files/image004.gif" height="244" width="277"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: black;">In this case the two equations describe lines
that intersect at one particular point. Clearly this point is on both lines,
and therefore its coordinates (<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>) will satisfy the
equation of either line. Thus the pair (<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>) is the one and
only solution to the system of equations.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="section" title="2. Dependent Equations">
<h3><a name="_Toc535568984">2. Dependent Equations</a></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol; color: black;">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b><i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Equations
describe the same line</span></i></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol; color: black;">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b><i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Infinite
number of solutions</span></i></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><img src="solution_set_files/image006.gif" height="244" width="277"></p>

<p class="MsoBlockText" style="margin-left: 0in;">Sometimes two equations might look different but actually describe the
same line. For example, in</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="color: black;"><sub><img src="solution_set_files/image008.gif" height="48" width="87"></sub></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: black;">The second equation is just two times the first
equation, so they are actually equivalent and would both be equations of the
same line. Because the two equations describe the same line, they have <i>all</i>
their points in common; hence there are an infinite number of solutions to the
system. </span></p>

<ul type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; margin-right: 0.5in;"><b><i><span style="font-family: Arial;">Attempting to solve gives an identity</span></i></b></li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: black;">If you try to solve a dependent system by
algebraic methods, you will eventually run into an equation that is an <i>identity</i>.
An identity is an equation that is always true, independent of the value(s) of
any variable(s). For example, you might get an equation that looks like <i>x</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>x</i>,
or 3&nbsp;=&nbsp;3. This would tell you that the system is a dependent system,
and you could stop right there because you will never find a unique solution.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="section" title="3. Inconsistent Equations">
<h3><a name="_Toc535568985">3. Inconsistent Equations</a></h3>

<ul type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; margin-right: 0.5in;"><b><i><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lines do not intersect (Parallel Lines; have the
     same slope)</span></i></b></li>

</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><img src="solution_set_files/image010.gif" height="244" width="277"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: black;">If two lines happen to have the same slope, but
are not identically the same line, then they will never intersect. There is no
pair (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) that could satisfy both equations, because there is
no point (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) that is simultaneously on both lines. Thus these
equations are said to be <i>inconsistent</i>, and there is no solution. The
fact that they both have the same slope may not be obvious from the equations,
because they are not written in one of the standard forms for straight lines.
The slope is not readily evident in the form we use for writing systems of
equations. (If you think about it you will see that the slope is the negative
of the coefficient of <i>x</i> divided by the coefficient of <i>y</i>).</span></p>

<ul type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; margin-right: 0.5in;"><b><i><span style="font-family: Arial;">Attempting to solve gives a false statement</span></i></b></li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: black;">By attempting to solve such a system of
equations algebraically, you are operating on a false assumption—namely that a
solution exists. This will eventually lead you to a <i>contradiction</i>: a
statement that is obviously false, regardless of the value(s) of the variable(s). At some point in your work you would get an obviously false
equation like 3&nbsp;=&nbsp;4. This would tell you that the system of equations
is inconsistent, and there is no solution.</span></p>

  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">For more complex systems, and especially those
  that contain non-linear equations, finding a solution by algebraic methods
  can be very difficult or even impossible. Using a graphing calculator (or a
  computer), you can graph the equations and actually see where they intersect.
  The calculator can then give you the coordinates of the intersection point.
  The only drawback to this method is that the solution is only an
  approximation, whereas the algebraic method gives the exact solution. In most
  practical situations, though, the precision of the calculator is sufficient.
  For more demanding scientific and engineering applications there are computer
  methods that can find approximate solutions to very high precision.</p>

<div class="Section1" title="Addition Method">

<h2><a name="_Toc535933516"><span style="font-variant: normal; text-transform: uppercase;">Addition Method</span></a></h2>

<p>The whole problem with solving a system of equations is that you cannot
solve an equation that has two unknowns in it. You need an equation with only
one variable so that you can isolate the variable on one side of the equation.
Both methods that we will look at are techniques for eliminating one of the
variables to give you an equation in just one unknown, which you can then solve
by the usual methods.</p>

<p>The first method of solving systems of linear equations is the addition
method, in which the two equations are added together to eliminate one of the
variables.</p>

<p>Adding the equations means that we add the left sides of the two equations
together, and we add the right sides together. This is legal because of the
Addition Principle, which says that we can add the same amount to both sides of
an equation. Since the left and right sides of any equation are equal to each
other, we are indeed adding the same amount to both sides of an equation.</p>

<p>Consider this simple example:</p>

<p><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">Example:</span></b> </p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><sub><img src="addition_method_files/image002.gif" height="48" width="87"></sub></p>

<p>If we add these equations together, the terms containing <i>y</i> will add
up to zero (2<i>y</i> plus <span style="font-family: Symbol;">-</span>2<i>y</i>),
and we will get</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><sub><img src="addition_method_files/image004.gif" height="72" width="79"></sub></p>

<p>or</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">5<i>x</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;5<br>
<b><i>x</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</b></p>

<p>However, we are not finished yet—we know <i>x</i>, but we still don’t know <i>y</i>.
We can solve for <i>y</i> by substituting the now known value for <i>x</i> into
either of our original equations. This will produce an equation that can be
solved for <i>y</i>:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><sub><img src="addition_method_files/image006.gif" height="136" width="88"></sub></p>

<p>Now that we know both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, we can say that the solution to
the system is the pair (1,&nbsp;1/2).</p>

<p>This last example was easy to see because of the fortunate presence of both
a positive and a negative 2<i>y</i>. One is not always this lucky. Consider</p>

<p><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">Example:</span></b> </p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><sub><img src="addition_method_files/image008.gif" height="48" width="87"></sub></p>

<p>Now there is nothing so obvious, but there is still something we can do. If
we multiply the first equation by <span style="font-family: Symbol;">-</span>3,
we get</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><sub><img src="addition_method_files/image010.gif" height="48" width="107"></sub></p>

<p>(Don’t forget to multiply every term in the equation, on both sides of the
equal sign). Now if we add them together the terms containing <i>x</i> will
cancel:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><sub><img src="addition_method_files/image012.gif" height="72" width="99"></sub></p>

<p>or</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><sub><img src="addition_method_files/image014.gif" height="41" width="41"></sub></p>

<p>As in the previous example, now that we know <i>y</i> we can solve for <i>x</i>
by substituting into either original equation. The first equation looks like
the easiest to solve for <i>x</i>, so we will use it:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><sub><img src="addition_method_files/image016.gif" height="112" width="87"></sub></p>

<p>And so the solution point is (<span style="font-family: Symbol;">-</span>4,&nbsp;7/2).</p>

<p>Now we look at an even less obvious example:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">Example:</span></b>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><sub><img src="addition_method_files/image018.gif" height="48" width="92"></sub></p>

<p>Here there is nothing particularly attractive about going after either the <i>x</i>
or the <i>y</i>. In either case, both equations will have to be multiplied by
some factor to arrive at a common coefficient. This is very much like the
situation you face trying to find a least common denominator for adding
fractions, except that here we call it a Least Common Multiple (LCM). As a
general rule, it is easiest to eliminate the variable with the smallest LCM.
In this case that would be the <i>y</i>, because the LCM of 2 and 3 is 6. If
we wanted to eliminate the <i>x</i> we would have to use a LCM of 10&nbsp;(5
times 2). So, we choose to make the coefficients of <i>y</i> into plus and
minus 6. To do this, the first equation must be multiplied by 3, and the second
equation by 2:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><sub><img src="addition_method_files/image020.gif" height="45" width="143"></sub></p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Now adding these two together will eliminate the terms containing <i>y</i>:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><sub><img src="addition_method_files/image022.gif" height="75" width="92"></sub></p>

<p>or</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><i>x</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2</p>

<p>We still need to substitute this value into one of the original equations
	to solve for <i>y</i>: </p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><sub><img src="addition_method_files/image024.gif" height="117" width="95"></sub></p>

<p>Thus the solution is the point (2,&nbsp;2).</p>

<div class="Section1" title="Substitution Method">

<h2><a name="_Toc535933517"><span style="font-variant: normal; text-transform: uppercase;">Substitution Method</span></a></h2>

<p>When we used the Addition Method to solve a system of equations, we still
had to do a substitution to solve for the remaining variable. With the
substitution method, we solve one of the equations for one variable in terms of
the other, and then substitute that into the other equation. This makes more
sense with an example:</p>

<p><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue;">Example:</span></b> </p>

<table style="width: 478.5pt; margin-left: 29.6pt;" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="638">
 <tbody><tr>
  <td style="width: 50%; padding: 5.25pt;" valign="top" width="50%">
  <p>2<i>y</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>x</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3</p>
  </td>
  <td style="width: 50%; padding: 5.25pt;" valign="top" width="50%">
  <p>(1)</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td style="width: 50%; padding: 5.25pt;" valign="top" width="50%">
  <p>4<i>y</i> – 3<i>x</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</p>
  </td>
  <td style="width: 50%; padding: 5.25pt;" valign="top" width="50%">
  <p>(2)</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Equation 1 looks like it would be easy to solve for <i>x</i>, so we take it
and isolate <i>x</i>:</p>

<table style="width: 478.5pt; margin-left: 29.6pt;" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="638">
 <tbody><tr>
  <td style="width: 50%; padding: 5.25pt;" valign="top" width="50%">
  <p>2<i>y</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>x</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3</p>
  </td>
  <td style="width: 50%; padding: 5.25pt;" valign="top" width="50%">
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td style="width: 50%; padding: 5.25pt;" valign="top" width="50%">
  <p><i>x</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 – 2<i>y</i></p>
  </td>
  <td style="width: 50%; padding: 5.25pt;" valign="top" width="50%">
  <p>(3)</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Now we can use this result and substitute 3&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Symbol;">-</span>&nbsp;2<i>y</i> in for <i>x</i> in equation 2:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><sub><img src="substitution_method_files/image002.gif" height="141" width="125"></sub></p>

<p>Now that we have <i>y</i>, we still need to substitute back in to get <i>x</i>.
We could substitute back into any of the previous equations, but notice that
equation 3 is already conveniently solved for <i>x</i>:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><sub><img src="substitution_method_files/image004.gif" height="91" width="76"></sub></p>

<p>And so the solution is (1,&nbsp;1).</p>

<p>As a rule, the substitution method is easier and quicker than the addition
method when one of the equations is very simple and can readily be solved for
one of the variables.</p>
