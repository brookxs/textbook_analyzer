 8.2.1  Background  A significant portion of the brain is devoted to vision and supports the maximum information transfer function from the environment to a human being.  The center of debates in the 1970s was whether vision should be considered data collection or also has aspects of information processing.     In   1969 Arnheim  questioned the then current psychological division of cognitive operations of 204                                                                                               Chapter 8  perception and thinking as separate processes (Arnheim-69). Until then perception was considered a data collection task and thinking as a higher level function using the data. He contended that visual perception includes the process of understanding the information, providing an ongoing feedback mechanism between the perception and thinking. He further expanded his views arguing that treating perception and thinking as separate functions treats the mind as a serial automata (Arnheim-86). Under this paradigm, the two mental functions exclude each other, with perception dealing with individual instances versus generalizations. Visualization is the transformation of information into a visual form which enables the user to observe and understand the information. This concept can be extended where the visual images provide a fundamentally different way to understand information that treats the visual input not as discrete facts but as an understanding process. The Gestalt psychologists postulate that the mind follows a set of rules to combine the input stimuli to a mental representation that differs from the sum of the individual inputs (Rock-90):  Proximity - nearby figures are grouped together Similarity - similar figures are grouped together  Continuity - figures are interpreted as smooth continuous patterns rather than discontinuous concatenations of shapes (e.g., a circle with its diameter drawn is perceived as two continuous shapes, a circle and a line, versus two half circles concatenated together)  Closure - gaps within a figure are filled in to create a whole (e.g., using  dashed lines to represent a square does not prevent understanding it as a square)  Connectedness - uniform and linked spots, lines or areas are perceived as a single unit  Shifting the information processing load from slower cognitive processes to faster perceptual systems significantly improves the information-carrying interfaces between humans and computers (Card-96). There are many ways to present information in the visual space. An understanding of the way the cognitive processes work provides insights for the decisions on which of the presentations will maximize the information passing and understanding. There is not a single correct answer on the best way to present information.
