 6.1.1 Bibliometric Analysis of Science  Most extensive analysis of citation has been in science. Long before Newton [Newton, 1776] appreciated "standing on the shoulders of the giants that came before," scientists realized that they need one another to advance. In some cases the reference is to arguments on which a new author builds; in other cases there is disagreement about hypotheses, data, or other facts.  The field of bibliometrics has found a great deal of interesting structure in graphs created by bibliographic citation links. That is, imagine each document in a corpus is represented by a node in a graph, and a directed edge is drawn from document dj to djy just in case dj refers to d{ in its bibliography.  Figure 6.3 shows this citation structure when the references are ordered by a natural, temporal feature. In any subject area, papers can be indexed chronologically, and a dot is placed at location (/, j) just in case document d\ cites document dj. Because citations can only run backward in time, this graph is upper triangular. "*"  As with many fields, this one begins with a small number of highly cross-linked papers in the upper-left corner. Strong horizontal and vertical stripes can also be seen against a more uncorrelated background.  What field's literature is this? 188       FINDING OUT ABOUT  Citing paper  0            20  Classic  40  100        120         140        160         180  Research front  width Â´ hardness (field)  Review article  200  FIGURE 6.3 Temporal Structure in Citations From [Price, 1986]. Reproduced with permission of Columbia University Press  Horizontal lines correspond to citations of classic papers: chestnuts that everyone includes in their bibliography. Vertical stripes are papers that  have much more extensive bibliographies and that stretch much farther back in time than typical; these are often referred to as review articles.  Note how these semantic determinations can be derived from patterns in the syntactic facts of citation. Other inferences are also possible. Perhaps the most common use of citation graphs is impact analysis.  In terms of the bibliographic graph, a document's importance, its effect on a field, is proportional to its in-degree: the number of citation links  pointing to a document node. Price provides motivation for this measure:  Flagrant violations there may be, but on the whole there is, whether we like it or not, a reasonably good correlation between INFERENCE BEYOND THE INDEX      189  the eminence of a scientist and his productivity of papers. It takes persistence and perseverance to be a good scientist, and these are frequently reflected in a sustained production of scholarly writing. [Price, 1986, pp. 35-36]  This suggests a simple heuristic, widely used by university deans who must quickly evaluate faculty members who are up for promotion: Important authors are those with higher impact than their peers! The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) has made an entire industry of collating bibliographic citations and inverting them. Its Web of Science3 product now makes hypertext navigation of this valuable information straightforward. Similar arguments can be extended to identify important academic departments, universities, even countries. This mode of analysis, used to evaluate individuals (and, by extension, departments, colleges, universities, even countries) consistently makes news when data and politics cross paths [May, 1997].  Finally, as mentioned in Section 5.2.5, cocitation can be used as a basis for interdocument similarity: Two documents are similar to the extent that their bibliographies overlap. Bar-Hillel has been credited with the first suggestion of using cocitation as a similarity metric between documents [Bar-Hillel, 1957; Swanson, 1988]; Henry Small, Eugene Garfield, and others have provided some of the first empirical support for this hypothesis [Small, 1973; Garfield, 1979; Garfield, 1982; Garfield, 1986].  So-called invisible colleges [Merton, 1973], connecting cliques of self-referential colleagues who are relatively independent of the rest of science, also have been identified. Beyond fully isolated cliques, higherorder structure over sets of documents can also be analyzed. We can imagine that the documents of one discipline have much higher connectivity among themselves than they do with papers in other disciplines. A new paper, whose bibliography cites papers coming from more than one discipline, can therefore be imagined to be a new cutting-edge synthesis.  Bibliometrics has also made clear many dangers in using citation data. What we might call the norm of scholarship, the average number of citations in a document, seems to be about 10 to 20 [Price, 1986, p. 161]. Some scientific disciplines rely on much longer bibliographies  3 www.webofscienoe.oom/ 190       FINDING OUT ABOUT  than others; within a discipline, idiosyncratic author variations in bibliography length are also common.
