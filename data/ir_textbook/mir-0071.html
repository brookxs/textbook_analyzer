 4.2.2    Context Queries Many systems complement single-word queries with the ability to search words in a given context, that is, near other words. Words which appear near each other may signal a higher likelihood of relevance than if they appear apart. For instance, we may want to form phrases of words or find words which are proximal in the text. Therefore, we distinguish two types of queries: Ã¯  Phrase  is a sequence of single-word queries. An occurrence of the phrase is a sequence of words. For instance, it is possible to search for the word kenhance,' and then for the word 'retrieval/ In phrase queries it is normally understood that the separators in the text need not be the same as those in the query (e.g., two spaces versus one space), and uninteresting words are not considered at all. For instance, the previous example could match a text such as '...enhance the retrieval...1. Although the notion of a phrase is a very useful feature in most cases, not all systems implement it. ?  Proximity   A more relaxed version of the phrase query is the proximity query. In this case, a sequence of single words or phrases is given, together 102        QUERY LANGUAGES AND translation syntax                      syntactic Figure 4.1 An example of a query syntax tree. It will retrieve all the documents which contain the word 'translation' as well as either the word 'syntax' or the word 'syntactic'. with a maximum allowed distance between them. For instance, the above example could state that the two words should occur within four words, and therefore a match could be c. . .enhance the power of retrieval. . ..' This distance can be measured in characters or words depending on the system. The words and phrases may or may not be required to appear in the same order as in the query. Phrases can be ranked in a fashion somewhat analogous to single words (see Chapters 2 and 5 for details). Proximity queries can be ranked in the same way if the parameters used by the ranking technique do not depend on physical proximity. Although it is not clear how to do better ranking, physical proximity has semantic value. This is because in most cases the proximity means that the words are in the same paragraph, and hence related in some way.
