 2.2.1 Ranking  Under Boolean systems, the status display is a count of the number of items found by the query.  Every one of the items meet all aspects of the Boolean  query. The reasons why an item was selected can easily be traced to and displayed (e.g., via highlighting) in the retrieved items. Hits are retrieved in either a sorted order (e.g., sort by Title) or in time order from the newest to the oldest item. With the introduction of ranking based upon predicted relevance values, the status summary displays the relevance score associated with the item along with a brief descriptor of the item (usually both fit on one display screen line).  The relevance Information Retrieval System Capabilities                                                    39  score is an estimate of the search system on how closely the item satisfies the search statement. Typically relevance scores are normalized to a value between 0.0 and 1.0. The highest value of 1.0 is interpreted that the system is sure that the item is relevant to the search statement. This allows the user to determine at what point to stop reviewing items because of reduced likelihood of relevance. Theoretically every item in the system could be returned but many of the items will have a relevance value of 0.0 (not relevant). Practically, systems have a default minimum value which the user can modify that stops returning items that have a relevance value below the specified value. In addition to ranking based upon the characteristics of the item and the database, in many circumstances collaborative filtering is providing an option for selecting and ordering output. In this case, users when reviewing items provide feedback to the system on the relative value of the item being accessed. The system accumulates the various user rankings and uses this information to order the output for other user queries that are similar. Collaborative filtering has been very successful in sites such as AMAZON.COM MovieFinder.com, and CDNow.com in deciding what products to display to users based upon their queries (Herlocker-99)  Since one line is usually dedicated per item in a summary display, part of a zone truncated by allocated space on the display is typically displayed with the relevance weight of the item. This zone is frequently the Title and provides the user with additional information with the relevance weight to avoid selecting nonrelevant items for review. Presenting the actual relevance number seems to be more confusing to the user than presenting a category that the number falls in. For example, some systems create relevance categories and indicate, by displaying items in different colors, which category an item belongs to. Other systems uses a nomenclature such as High, Medium High, Medium, Low, and Non-relevant. The color technique removes the need for written indication of an item's relevance, thereby providing additional positions in a line to display more of the title but causes problems with users that suffer from partial or total color blindness.  Rather than limiting the number of items that can be assessed by the number of lines on a screen, other graphical visualization techniques showing the relevance relationships of the hit items can be used. For example, a two or three dimensional graph can be displayed where points on the graph represent items and the location of the points represent their relative relationship between each other and the user's query. In some cases color is also used in this representation. This technique allows a user to see the clustering of items by topics and browse through a cluster or move to another topical cluster. This has an analogy of moving through the stacks at a library. In a single image the user can see the effects of his search statement rather than displaying a few items at a time.  Information visualization is also being used in displaying individual items and the terms that contributed to the item's selection. This graphical display assists the user in determining how to reformulate his query to improve finding the information the user requires.   Chapter 8 describes information visualization.
