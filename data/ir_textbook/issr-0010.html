 1.4 Relationship to Database Management Systems  There are two major categories of systems available to process items:  Information Retrieval Systems and Data Base Management Systems (DBMS). Confusion   can  arise  when  the  software  systems   supporting  each   of these  applications get confiised with the data they are manipulating. An Information Retrieval System is software that has the features and functions required to  manipulate "information" items versus a DBMS that is optimized to handle "structured" data. Information is fuzzy text. The term "fuzzy*"' is used to imply the  results from the minimal standards or controls on the creators of the text items. The author is trying to present concepts, ideas and abstractions along with supporting facts. As such, there is minimal consistency in the vocabulary and styles of items discussing the exact same issue. The searcher has to be omniscient to specify all search term possibilities in the query. Introduction to Information Retrieval Systems                                              21  Structured data is well defined data (facts) typically represented by tables. There is a semantic description associated with each attribute within a table that well defines that attribute. For example, there is no confusion between the meaning of "employee name" or "employee salary" and what values to enter in a specific database record. On the other hand, if two different people generate an abstract for the same item, they can be different. One abstract may generally discuss the most important topic in an item. Another abstract, using a different vocabulary, may specify the details of many topics. It is this diversity and ambiguity of language that causes the fuzzy nature to be associated with information items. The differences in the characteristics of the data is one reason for the major differences in functions required for the two classes of systems.  With structured data a user enters a specific request and the results returned provide the user with the desired information. The results are frequently tabulated and presented in a report format for ease of use. In contrast, a search of "information" items has a high probability of not finding all the items a user is looking for. The user has to refine his search to locate additional items of interest. This process is called "iterative search." An Information Retrieval System gives the user capabilities to assist the user in finding the relevant items, such as relevance feedback (see Chapters 2 and 7). The results from an information system search are presented in relevance ranked order. The confusion comes when DBMS software is used to store "information." This is easy to implement, but the system lacks the ranking and relevance feedback features that are critical to an information system. It is also possible to have structured data used in an information system (such as TOPIC). When this happens the user has to be very creative to get the system to provide the reports and management information that are trivially available in a DBMS.  From a practical standpoint, the integration of DBMS's and Information Retrieval Systems is very important. Commercial database companies have already integrated the two types of systems. One of the first commercial databases to integrate the two systems into a single view is the INQUIRE DBMS. This has been available for over fifteen years. A more current example is the ORACLE DBMS that now offers an imbedded capability called CONVECTIS, which is an informational retrieval system that uses a comprehensive thesaurus which provides the basis to generate "themes" for a particular item. CONVECTIS also provides standard statistical techniques that are described in Chapter 5. The INFORMIX DBMS has the ability to link to RetrievalWare to provide integration of structured data and information along with functions associated with Information Retrieval Systems.
