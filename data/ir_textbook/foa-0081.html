 4.4.3 Interactive RAVE  The interactive portion of RAVE is an HTML document, as shown in  Figure 4.19. The top of RAVE's window displays the three queries against  which the subject is to judge each document. Two queries are short sentences or phrases, in this case REASONIMG ABOUT UNCERTAINTY 144      FINDING OUT ABOUT  *;j    Back      Forward    Reload       Home Search       Guide       images       Print     Security       Slop m  TITLE: DESIGN OF A The need for a reliable method of measuring the depth, of ±  RECOGNITION SYSTEM FOR anesthesia has existed since the introduction of s  MONITORING THE DEPTH OF anesthesia.

The planning process is divided into two phases In the first   AUTHOR: CHANG, phase, the system analyses the problem from a global viewpoint. This is   KAI-HSIUNG done by inferring from the heuristic rules to order the original subgoals   YEAR: 1986 and to post constraints. With this global analysis, fruitless search space   INSTITUTION: UNIVERSITY OF can be pruned so that the effort is directed in the right direction during   CINCINNATI (0045) the plan generation. In the second phase, the refinement process selects    operators from the goal-oriented operator representations to achieve each    subgoal. Each operator representation b named by its goal and contains    local knovMge of hov to refine the operator under various conditions.   bti,:.:.;...........;,:,;........,ï,:::,:....................... ,......,,Ñ,........,,.......,..........,........;!,............*,............ÑÑ............*..........................,......................................Ñ..................................ª.....................................,.............................   FIGURE 4.19 RAVE Interface  and LEGAL APPLICATIONS, and the third Is a scrolling pane containing the text of the long, J?e/FfcA:-defined document (in this example, the  thesis A PLANNING MODEL WITH PROBLEM ANALYSIS...). While the subject is asked to judge the documents shown to him or her as ASSESSING THE RETRIEVAL       145  being about the two short queries, the task associated with the relevance feedbackdocument query is to find "documents like this."  Beneath each query the RAVE window contains four radio buttons labeled "Not" (relevant), "Possibly" (relevant), "Relevant," and "Critically" (relevant). Because we asked our subjects to spend two hours each but could not assume their participation would be continuous, there is a "Quit" button that allows the subject to suspend the session; when the subject launches RAVE again, the session is resumed where he or she left off. Finally, the "Next" button is pressed after the subject has read and recorded his or her relevance assessments for a document.
