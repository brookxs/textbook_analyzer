 6,6 Deep Interfaces  Probably because interface technology did not support rich graphical presentations and pointing devices until late in the development of computer science, the human-computer interface (HCI) is often an afterthought in software engineering. This bias remains today in search engine designs, which assume the indexing and match algorithms can be separated from the presentation of results [Harman, 1992b; Rose and Belew, 1990].  Sometimes interface design is approached as a data visualization task [Veerasamy and Belkin, 1996]. Korfhage's VIBE presentation [Korfhage, 1995] highlights a user's and author's perspectives on topical areas. Rather than assuming that there is one absolute preferred perspective on keywords, Korfhage considers what the words look like from the perspective of users and authors, respectively.  In terms of the vector space model, we can think of these as projections. The huge dimensional space of keywords, or even the still large reduced dimension representation, is still far more than we can visualize on a two-dimensional computer screen. We can try to impose other dimensions (e.g., color or size), but we still must pick some projected subspace of the larger data set. Norman and Schneiderman have written extensively on the design of interfaces that are deeply connected to the user's underlying task [Norman, 1988; Schneiderman, 1992]; Marchianoni has focused particularly on interfaces for the "information seeking" task [Marchianoni, 1995]. As part of the Xerox PARC group, Hearst has explored a number of visualization techniques (cf. Figure 6.8); she has also recently provided an extensive survey of interface technologies [Hearst, 1999].
