 2.1.1 Boolean Logic  Boolean logic allows a user to logically relate multiple concepts together to define what information is needed. Typically the Boolean functions apply to processing tokens identified anywhere within an item. The typical Boolean operators are AND, OR, and NOT. These operations are implemented using set intersection, set union and set difference procedures. A few systems introduced the concept of "exclusive or" but it is equivalent to a slightly more complex query using the other operators and is not generally useful to users since most users do not understand it. Placing portions of the search statement in parentheses are used to overtly specify the order of Boolean operations (i.e., nesting function). If parentheses are not used, the system follows a default precedence ordering of operations (e.g., typically NOT then AND then OR). In the examples of effects of Boolean operators given in Figure 2.1, no precedence order is given to the operators and queries are processed Left to Right unless parentheses are included. Most commercial systems do not allow weighting of Boolean queries. A technique to allow weighting Boolean queries is described in Chapter 7. Some of the deficiencies of use of Boolean operators in information systems are summarized by Belkin and Croft (Belkin-89).  A special type of Boolean search is called "M of N" logic. The user lists a set of possible search terms and identifies, as acceptable, any item that contains a subset of the terms. For example, "Find any item containing any two of the following terms: "AA," "BB," "CC." This can be expanded into a Boolean search that performs an AND between all combinations of two terms and "OR"s the results together ((AA AND BB) or (AA AND CC) or (BB AND CC)). Some search examples and their meanings are given in Figure 2.1. Most Information Retrieval Systems allow Boolean operations as well as allowing for the natural language interfaces discussed in Section 2.1.8. As noted in Chapter 1, very little attention has been focused on integrating the Boolean search functions and weighted information retrieval techniques into a single search result.
