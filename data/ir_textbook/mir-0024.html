 2.2    A Taxonomy of Information Retrieval Models The three classic models in information retrieval are called Boolean, vector, and probabilistic. In the Boolean model, documents and queries are represented as sets of index terms. Thus, as suggested in [327], we say that the model is set theoretic. In the vector model, documents and queries are represented as vectors in a t-dimensional space. Thus, we say that the model is algebraic. In the probabilistic model, the framework for modeling document and query representations is based on probability theory. Thus, as the name indicates, we say that the model is probabilistic. Over the years, alternative modeling paradigms for each type of classic model (i.e., set theoretic, algebraic, and probabilistic) have been proposed. Regarding alternative set theoretic models, we distinguish the fuzzy and the extended Boolean models. Regarding alternative algebraic models, we distinguish the generalized vector, the latent semantic indexing, and the neural network models. Regarding alternative probabilistic models, we distinguish the inference network and the belief network models. Figure 2.1 illustrates a taxonomy of these information retrieval models. Besides references to the text content, the model might also allow references to the structure normally present in written text. In this case, we say that we have a structured model. We distinguish two models for structured text retrieval namely, the non-overlapping lists model and the proximal nodes model. As discussed in Chapter 1, the user task might be one of browsing (instead of retrieval). In Figure 2.1, we distinguish three models for browsing namely, flat, structure guided, and hypertext. The organization of this chapter follows the taxonomy of information retrieval models depicted in the figure.We first discuss the three classic models. Second, we discuss the alternative models for each type of classic model. Third, we cover structured text retrieval models. At the end, we discuss models for browsing. We emphasize that the IR model (Boolean, vector, probabilistic, etc.), the logical view of the documents (full text, set of index terms, etc.), and the user task (retrieval, browsing) are orthogonal aspects of a retrieval system as detailed in Chapter 1. Thus, despite the fact that some models are more appropriate for a certain user task than for another, the same IR model can be used with distinct document logical views to perform different user tasks. Figure 2.2 illustrates the retrieval models most frequently associated with each one of six distinct combinations of a document logical view and a user task.
