 5.2.2    Term Reweighting for the Probabilistic Model The probabilistic model dynamically ranks documents similar to a query q according to the probabilistic ranking principle. Prom Chapter 2, we already know that the similarity of a document dj to a query q can be expressed as 2=1 szm(d^q) a V wUq wid     log       v   J   '     + log     p^ -              (5.2) l-P(kt\R)        *    P(ki\R) where P(fci|i?) stands for the probability of observing the term k{ in the set R of relevant documents and P(ki\R) stands for the probability of observing the term k{ in the set R of non-relevant documents. Initially, equation 5.2 cannot be used because the probabilities P(kl\R) and P(kt\R) are unknown. A number of different methods for estimating these probabilities automatically (i.e., without feedback from the user) were discussed in Chapter 2. With user feedback information, these probabilities are estimated in a slightly different way as follows. For the initial search (when there are no retrieved documents yet), assumptions often made include: (a) P(ki\R) is constant for all terms ki (typically 0.5) and (b) the term probability distribution P(ki\R) can be approximated by the distribution in the whole collection. These two assumptions yield: P{k{\R)   =   0.5 where, as before, nt stands for the number of documents in the collection which contain the term k(. Substituting into equation 5.2, we obtain t                                            AT f ,     N     v^              ,     iv-rii sirriin^iaiidj.q) ~ x     ......     1-i For the feedback searches, the accumulated statistics related to the relevance or non-relevance of previously retrieved documents are used to evaluate the probabilities P(ki\R) and P(ki\~R). As before, let Dr be the set of relevant retrieved documents (according to the user judgement) and Drj be the subset of DT composed of the documents which contain the term k{. Then, the probabilities P(ki\R) and P(ki\R) can be approximated by (5.3) USER RELEVANCE FEEDBACK        121 Using these approximations, equation 5.2 can rewritten as r      \Dr,i\                  n,-\Dr,i\ Notice that here, contrary to the procedure in the vector space model, no query expansion occurs. The same query terms are being reweighted using feedback information provided by the user. Formula 5.3 poses problems for certain small values of \Dr\ and \Dr^\ that frequently arise in practice (\Dr\ = 1, \Dr^\ = 0). For this reason, a 0.5 adjustment factor is often added to the estimation of P(kt\R) and P(ki\R) yielding This 0.5 adjustment factor may provide unsatisfactory estimates in some cases, and alternative adjustments have been proposed such as rii/N or (n^ ó |Dr,z|) /{N - \Dr\) [843]. Taking rii/N as the adjustment factor (instead of 0.5), equation 5.4 becomes )-    N-\Dr\+l The main advantages of this relevance feedback procedure are that the feedback process is directly related to the derivation of new weights for query terms and that the term reweighting is optimal under the assumptions of term independence and binary document indexing (wi,q Ä {0,1} and u^j Ä {0,1}). The disadvantages include: (1) document term weights are not taken into account during the feedback loop; (2) weights of terms in the previous query formulations are also disregarded; and (3) no query expansion is used (the same set of index terms in the original query is reweighted over and over again). As a result of these disadvantages, the probabilistic relevance feedback methods do not in general operate as effectively as the conventional vector modification methods. To extend the probabilistic model with query expansion capabilities, different approaches have been proposed in the literature ranging from term weighting for query expansion to term clustering techniques based on spanning trees. All of these approaches treat probabilistic query expansion separately from probabilistic term reweighting. While we do not discuss them here, a brief history of research on this issue and bibliographical references can be found in section 5.6.
