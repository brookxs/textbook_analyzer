 8.8.1    Sequential Searching A few approaches to directly searching compressed text exist. One of the most successful techniques in practice relies on Huffman coding taking words as symbols. That is, consider each different text word as a symbol, count their frequencies, and generate a Huffman codefor the words. Then, compress the text by replacing each word with its code. To improve compression/decompression efficiency, the Huffman code uses an alphabet of bytes instead of bits. This scheme compresses faster and better than known commercial systems, even those based on Ziv-Lempel coding. Since Huffman coding needs to store the codes of each symbol, this scheme has to store the whole vocabulary of the text, i.e. the list of all different text words. This is fully exploited to efficiently search complex queries. Although according to Heaps' law the vocabulary (i.e., the alphabet) grows as 0{n) for 0 lt; (3 lt; 1, the generalized Zipf's law shows that the distribution is skewed enough so that the entropy remains constant (i.e., the compression ratio will not degrade as the text grows). Those laws are explained in Chapter 6. Any single-wrord or pattern query is first searched in the vocabulary. Some queries can be binary searched, while others such as approximate searching or regular expression searching must traverse sequentially all the vocabulary. This vocabulary is rather small compared to the text size, thanks to Heaps' law. Notice that this process is exactly the same as the vocabulary searching performed by inverted indices, either for simple or complex pattern matching. Once that search is complete, the list of different words that match the query is obtained. The Huffman codes of all those wrords are collected and they are searched in the compressed text. One alternative is to traverse byte-wise the compressed text and traverse the Huffman decoding tree in synchronization, so that each time that a leaf is reached, it is checked whether the leaf (i.e., word) was marked as 'matching' the query or not. This is illustrated in Figure 8.24. Boyer-Moore filtering can be used to speed up the search. Solving phrases is a little more difficult. Each element is searched in the vocabulary. For each word of the vocabulary we define a bit mask. We set the /-th bit in the mask of all words which match with the i-th element of the phrase query. This is used together with the Shift-Or algorithm. The text is traversed byte-wise, and only when a leaf is reached, does the Shift-Or algorithm consider that a new text symbol has been read, whose bit mask is that of the leaf (see Figure 8.24). This algorithm is surprisingly simple and efficient. 224        INDEXING AND SEARCHING EH cm cm cm cm m cm cm cm cm Huffman tree cm Vocabulary      Marks cm cm cm cm cm cm n cm Huffman tree rrooi rrfoi ["Tool CZH Vocabulary      Marks Figure 8.24 On the left, searching for the simple pattern 'rose' allowing one error. On the right, searching for the phrase 'ro* rose is,' where 'ro*' represents a prefix search. This scheme is especially fast when it comes to solving a complex query (regular expression, extended pattern, approximate search, etc.) that would be slow with a normal algorithm. This is because the complex search is done only in the small vocabulary, after which the algorithm is largely insensitive to the complexity of the originating query. Its CPU times for a simple pattern are slightly higher than those of Agrep (briefly described in section 8.5.6). However, if the I/O times are considered, compressed searching is faster than all the online algorithms. For complex queries, this scheme is unbeaten by far. On the reference machine, the CPU times are 14 Mb/sec for any query, while for simple queries this improves to 18 Mb/sec if the speedup technique is used. Agrep, on the other hand, runs at 15 Mb/sec on simple searches and at 1-4 Mb/sec for complex ones. Moreover, I/O times are reduced to one third on the compressed text.
