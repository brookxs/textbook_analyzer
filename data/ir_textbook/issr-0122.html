 10.3 Graph Retrieval  Another important media class is graphics, to include tables and charts (e.g., column, bar, line, pie, scatter). Graphs are constructed from more primitive data elements such as points, lines, and labels. An innovative example of a graph retrieval system is Sagebook (Chuah, Roth, and Kerpedjiev 1997) created at Carnegie Mellon University (see www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/sage/sage.html). SageBook, enables both search and customization of stored data graphics. Just as we may require an audio query during audio retrieval, Sagebook supports datagraphic query, representation (i.e., content description), indexing, search, and adaptation capabilities.  Figure 10.3 shows an example of a graphical query and the data-graphics returned for that query. As illustrated in the bottom left hand side of Figure 10.3, queries are formulated via a graphical direct-manipulation interface (called  v-,er FaU Picagfl_________|  ¶----SV     - V  ,- r  l|(l|,,,,lW.......,l,',´lW||M,n'., ,ml,!........Ñ......Ñ......,¶.ÑÑ´,,*ª, Ñ´,      Figure 10.3.

The right hand side of Figure 10.3 displays the relevant graphics retrieved by matching the underlying content and/or properties of the graphical query at the bottom left of Figure 10.3 with those of graphics stored in a library. Both exact matching and similarity based matching is performed on both graphical elements (or graphemes) as well as on the underlying data represented by the graphic. For example, in the query and responses in Figure 10.3, for two graphemes to match, they must be of the same class (i.e. bars, lines, marks) as well as use the same properties (i.e. color, shape, size, width) to encode data. The matches returned are sorted according to their degree of similarity to the query based on the match criteria. In Figure 10.3, all the data-graphics returned by a "close graphics matching strategy" (i.e., they are all of type "chart", have exactly one space in the graphic, and contain graphemes of type horizontal interval bar) are highlighted in the Figure.  In addition, retrieved data-graphics can be manually adapted. SageBook maintains an internal representation of the syntax and semantics of data-graphics, which includes spatial relationships between objects, relationships between datadomains (e.g., interval, 2D coordinate), and the various graphic and data attributes. Search is performed both on graphical and data properties, with three and four alternative search strategies, respectively, to enable varying degrees of match relaxation. Just as in large text and imagery collections, several data-graphic grouping techniques based on data and graphical properties were designed to enable clustering for browsing large collections. Finally, SageBook provides automatic adaptation techniques that can modify the retrieved graphic (e.g., eliminating graphical elements) that do not match the specified query.  The ability to retrieve graphics by content may enable new capabilities in a broad range of domains beyond business graphics. For example, graphics play a predominant role in domains such as cartography (terrain, elevation, features), architecture (blueprints), communications and networking (routers and links), systems engineering (components and connections) and military campaign planning (e.g., forces and defenses overlayed on maps). In each of these cases graphical elements, their properties, relations, and structure, can be analyzed for retrieval purposes.
