 2.5.5    Brief Comparison of Classic Models In general, the Boolean model is considered to be the weakest classic method. Its main problem is the inability to recognize partial matches which frequently leads to poor performance. There is some controversy as to whether the probabilistic model outperforms the vector model. Croft performed some experiments and suggested that the probabilistic model provides a better retrieval performance. However, experiments done afterwards by Salton and Buckley refute that claim. Through several different measures, Salton and Buckley showed that the vector model is expected to outperform the probabilistic model with general collections. This also seems to be the dominant thought among researchers, practitioners, and the Web community, where the popularity of the vector model runs high.
