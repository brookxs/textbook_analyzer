 1.1.1    Information versus Data Retrieval Data retrieval, in the context of an IR system, consists mainly of determining which documents of a collection contain the keywords in the user query which, most frequently, is not enough to satisfy the user information need. In fact, the user of an IR system is concerned more with retrieving Â¶information about a 2        INTRODUCTION subject than with retrieving data which satisfies a given query. A data retrieval language aims at retrieving all objects which satisfy clearly defined conditions such as those in a regular expression or in a relational algebra expression. Thus, for a data retrieval system, a single erroneous object among a thousand retrieved objects means total failure. For an information retrieval system, however, the retrieved objects might be inaccurate and small errors are likely to go unnoticed. The main reason for this difference is that information retrieval usually deals with natural language text which is not always well structured and could be semantically ambiguous. On the other hand, a data retrieval system (such as a relational database) deals with data that has a well defined structure and semantics. Data retrieval, while providing a solution to the user of a database system, does not solve the problem of retrieving information about a subject or topic. To be effective in its attempt to satisfy the user information need, the IR system must somehow interpret' the contents of the information items (documents) in a collection and rank them according to a degree of relevance to the user query. This 'interpretation' of a document content involves extracting syntactic and semantic information from the document text and using this information to match the user information need. The difficulty is not only knowing how to extract this information but also knowing how to use it to decide relevance. Thus, the notion of relevance is at the center of information retrieval. In fact, the primary goal of an IR system is to retrieve all the documents which are relevant to a user query while retrieving as few non-relevant documents as possible.
