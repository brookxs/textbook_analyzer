 4.2         Stemming Algorithms  The concept of stemming has been applied to information systems from their initial automation in the 1960's. The original goal of stemming was to improve performance and require less system resources by reducing the number of unique words that a system has to contain. With the continued significant increase in storage and computing power, use of stemming for performance reasons is no longer as important. Stemming is now being reviewed for the potential improvements it can make In recall versus its associated decline in precision. A system designer can trade off the increased overhead of stemming in creating processing tokens versus reduced search time overhead of processing query terms with trailing "don't cares" (see Section 2.1.5 Term Masking) to include all of their variants. The stemming process creates one large index for the stem versus Term Masking which requires the merging (ORing) of the indexes for every term that matches the search term.
