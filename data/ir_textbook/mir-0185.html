 10.3.2    Non-Search Parts of the Information Access Process The O'Day and Jeffries study [614] found that information seeking is only one part of the full work process their subjects were engaged in. In between searching sessions many different kinds of work was done with the retrieved information, including reading and annotating [617] and analysis. O'Day and Jeffries examined the analysis steps in more detail, finding that 80% of this work fell into six main types: finding trends, making comparisons, aggregating information, identifying a critical subset, assessing, and interpreting. The remaining 20% consisted of cross-referencing, summarizing, finding evocative visualizations for reports, and miscellaneous activities. The Sensemaking work of Russell et al. [690] also discusses information work as a process in which information retrieval plays only a small part. They observe that most of the effort made in Sensemaking is in the synthesis of a good representation, or ways of thinking about, the problem at hand. They describe the process of formulating and crystallizing the important concepts for a given task. 266        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION From these observations it is convenient to divide the entire information access process into two main components: search/retrieval, and analysis /synthesis of results. User interfaces should allow both kinds of activity to be tightly interwoven, However, analysis/synthesis are activities that can be done independently of information seeking, and for our purposes it is useful to make a distinction between the two types of activities.
