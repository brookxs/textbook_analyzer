 14.6    Bibliographic Discussion The early history of online databases and systems makes interesting reading, and Hahn's 'Pioneers of the Online Age' is a good place to start [331]. The early history of online systems is also described by Bourne [107], and the history of electronic databases by Neufeld and Cornog [600]. The current status of the online industry is profiled annually in the May 1 issue of Library Journal (see, for example, [757]). An overview of research issues in OPACs is provided by Large and Beheshti [482]. A 1996 issue of the Journal of the American Society for Information Science was a special topic issue on 'Current Research in Online Public Access Systems' [68]. Comparative information on OPACs (and other library management system software) is readily available. A Council on Library and Information Resources report profiles 12 major vendors and their products [351]. The April 1 issue of Library Journal each year includes an 'Automated System Marketplace" update which discusses trends in library management systems, provides company and product information, and tabulates sales. Library Technology Reports frequently publishes 'consumer reports' of online systems; for instance, one issue was devoted to a survey of Z39.50 clients [813]. Recent monographs by Allen [13] and Marchionini [542] address the issues of user-centered design and electronic information seeking behavior.
