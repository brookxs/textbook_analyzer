 Appendix Porter's Algorithm The rules in the Porter algorithm are separated into five distinct phases numbered from 1 to 5. They are applied to the words in the text starting from phase 1 and moving on to phase 5. Further, they are applied sequentially one after the other as commands in a program. Thus, in what follows, we specify the Porter algorithm in a pseudo programming language whose commands take the form of rules for suffix substitution (as above). This pseudo language adopts the following (semi-formal) conventions: ï  A consonant variable is represented by the symbol C which is used to refer to any letter other than a,e,i,o,u and other than the letter y preceded by a consonant. ï  A vowel variable is represented by the symbol V which is used to refer to any letter which is not a consonant. ï  A generic letter (consonant or vowel) is represented by the symbol L. ï  The symbol lt;jgt; is used to refer to an empty string (i.e., one with no letters). ï  Combinations of C, V", and L are used to define patterns. ï  The symbol * is used to refer to zero or more repetitions of a given pattern. ï  The symbol -f is used to refer to one or more repetitions of a given pattern. ï  Matched parentheses are used to subordinate a sequence of variables to the operators * and -f. ï  A generic pattern is a combination of symbols, matched parentheses, and the operators * and ~f. 433 434       PORTER'S ALGORITHM ï  The substitution rules are treated as commands which are separated by a semicolon punctuation mark. ï  The substitution rules are applied to the suffixes in the current word. ï  A conditional if statement is expressed as 'if (pattern) rule' and the rule is executed only if the pattern in the condition matches the current word. ï  A line which starts with a % is treated as a comment. ï  Curly brackets (braces) are used to form compound commands. ï  A 'select rule with longest suffix' statement selects a single rule for execution among all the rules in a compound command. The rule selected is the one with the largest matching suffix. Thus, the expression (C)* refers to a sequence of zero or more consonants while the expression ((V)*(C)*)* refers to a sequence of zero or more vowels followed by zero or more consonants which can appear zero or more times. It is important to distinguish the above from the sequence (V * C) which states that a sequence must be present and that this sequence necessarily starts with a vowel, followed by a subsequence of zero or more letters, and finished by a consonant. Finally, the command if (*y * L) then ed ógt; lt;/gt; states that the substitution of the suffix ed by nil (i.e., the removal of the suffix ed) only occurs if the current word contains a vowel and at least one additional letter. The Porter algorithm is applied to each word in the text (simple formulation) and is given by the following procedure. % Phase 1: Plurals and past participles. select rule with longest suffix { sses ógt; ss; ies ó? i; ss ó* ss; s ógt; lt;/gt;; } select rule with longest suffix { if ((Cn(V)+(C) + )+(VTeed) then eed ógt; ee; if (*V*ed or *V*ing) then { PORTER'S ALGORITHM        435 select rule with longest suffix { ed ógt;  ing ógt; 0; } select rule with longest suffix { at ógt; ate; bl ó? ble; iz ógt; ize; if ((*CiC2) and  (Ci   =   C2)  and (Ci 0 {l,s,z})) then CXC2 ógt; Ci; if   {({CY{{V)+(C)+)ClV1C2)   and (C2 £ {w,x,y})) then e; } if (*V*y) then y ógt; i; if((C)*((I/)+(C)+)+(I/)* select rule with longest suffix { ational ó? ate; tional ógt; tion; enci ógt; ence; anci ó? ance; izer ógt; ize; abli ó^ able; alii ógt; al; entli ógt; ent; eli ó? e; ousli ógt;ï ous; ization ógt; ize; ation ó? ate; at or ógt; ate; alism ó? al; iveness ó? ive; fulness óy fill: ousness ó-*- ous; aiiti ógt;- al; iviti ógt; ive; biliti ó? ble; } select rule with longest suffix { icate ó* ic; at ive -ó? dgt;; 436        PORTER'S ALGORITHM alize ó? al; iciti ógt; ic; ical ó? ic; ful ó* 4gt;ness ó? cp; } if ((C)*((V)+(C)+)((V)+(C)+)+(V)*) then select rule with longest suffix { al ógt; 0; ance ó? 0; ence ógt; 0; er ógt; 0; ic ógt; 4gt;; able ój- cp; ible ógt;¶ 0; ant ó?
