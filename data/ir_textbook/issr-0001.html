Tied closely to the definition of an Information Retrieval System are the system objectives. It is satisfaction of the objectives that drives those areas that receive the most attention in development. For example, academia pursues all aspects of information systems, investigating new theories, algorithms and heuristics to advance the knowledge base. Academia does not worry about response time, required resources to implement a system to support thousands of users nor operations and maintenance costs associated with system delivery. On the other hand, commercial institutions are not always concerned with the optimum theoretical approach, but the approach that minimizes development costs and increases the salability of their product. This text considers both view points and technology states. Throughout this text, information retrieval is viewed from both the theoretical and practical viewpoint.  The functional view of an Information Retrieval System is introduced to put into perspective the technical areas discussed in later chapters. As detailed algorithms and architectures are discussed, they are viewed as subfiinctions within a total system. They are aiso correlated to the major objective of an Information Retrieval System which  is minimization of human resources required in the Chapter 1  finding of needed information to accomplish a task. As with any discipline, standard measures are identified to compare the value of different algorithms. In information systems, precision and recall are the key metrics used in evaluations. Early introduction of these concepts in this chapter will help the reader in understanding the utility of the detailed algorithms and theory introduced throughout this text.  There is a potential for confusion in the understanding of the differences between Database Management Systems (DBMS) and Information Retrieval Systems. It is easy to confuse the software that optimizes functional support of each type of system with actual information or structured data that is being stored and manipulated. The importance of the differences lies in the inability of a database management system to provide the functions needed to process "information." The opposite, an information system containing structured data, also suffers major functional deficiencies. These differences are discussed in detail in Section 1.4.
