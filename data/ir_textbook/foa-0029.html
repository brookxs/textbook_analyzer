 2.4 Example Corpora  In these experiments, and the rest that follow, we will consistently use two example corpora.  The first of these we will call the "Artificial Intelligence Thesis" (AIT) corpus. This is approximately 5000 Ph.D. and Master's dissertations and abstracts. Virtually every dissertation published within the last 30 years EXTRACTING LEXICAL FEATURES       49  Year  FIGURE 2.3 AIT Year Distribution  has been microfilmed by University Microfilms, Inc. (UMI)J* The corpus is a fairly exhaustive set of theses classified as AI by UMI from the years 1987 to 1997. A histogram of the theses distribution by year is shown in Figure 2.3.  We will focus on a handful of characteristics of each thesis:  ï  Thesis number  ï  Title  ï  Author  ï  Year  ï  University  ï  Advisor  ï  Language  ï  Abstract  ï  Degree  For now, we will lump these attributes into two categories: textual fields and structured attributes. Structured attributes are ones for which we can reason more formally, using database and artificial intelligence techniques. For now, we will concentrate on only the textual fields. The abstract will be the primary textual element associated with each thesis, while its title (also a textual field) will be used as its proxy - a synopsis of  More about AIT origins 50       FINDING OUT ABOUT  the thesis that conveys much of its meaning in a highly abbreviated form. Proxies will prove very important surrogates for the documents (for example, when users are presented with hitlists of retrieved documents). The second corpus we will study could not be provided on the CD because you must provide it yourself; it is all of your email. Email is now a fundamental form of transient, nearly immediate communication for many, but the resulting permanent record of these conversations can also be treated as a static, long-lived type of "literature" [Belew and Rentzepis, 1990]. We will assume that with disk storage as cheaply available as it How do I index    is today, you at some point began to collect email.^ Typically, some of my email?           ^jg w{\\ \ye email others have sent you, but you may have also kept a  copy of all of your "outgoing" email. Many email clients support onthe-fly segregation of email into separate folders. Minimally, this means that our procedures for indexing email must be capable of traversing elaborate directory structures. Later, we will also consider the use of this user-generated structure as a source for learning; cf. Section 7.4.  The directory in which you have filed an email message is one feature we may associate with each message; whether it is an incoming or outgoing message is another. But of course email also has many structured attributes associated with it, in its header. These include:  ï  From: ïTo:  ï  Cc:  ï  Subject:  ï  Date:  In general, we will put off all consideration of structured attributes  associated with documents until later. For now, simply note the many  parallels between our two example corpora: Both have well-defined authors, well-defined time-stamps, and excellent and obvious candidates for proxy text.
