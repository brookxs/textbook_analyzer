 2.7.1    Generalized Vector Space Model As already discussed, the three classic models assume independence of index terms. For the vector model, this assumption is normally interpreted as follows. Definition     Let ki be a vector associated with the index term kz. Independence of index terms in the vector model implies thai the set of vectors {k\, k2, kt) is linearly independent and forms a basis for the subspace of interest.   The dimension of this space is the number t of index terms in the collection. Frequently, independence among index terms is interpreted in a more restrictive sense to mean pairwise orthogonality among the index term vectors i.e., to mean that for each pair of index term vectors k% and k3 we have ki ïkJ =0. In 1985, however, Wong, Ziarko, and Wong [832] proposed an interpretation in which the index term vectors are assumed linearly independent but are not pairwise orthogonal. Such interpretation leads to the generalized vector space model which we now discuss. 42        MODELING In the generalized vector space model, two index term vectors might be non-orthogonal. This means that index term vectors are not seen as the orthogonal vectors which compose the basis of the space. Instead, they are themselves composed of smaller components which are derived from the particular collection at hand as follows. Definition Given the set {k\, k2, ..., kt} of index terms in a collection, as before, let Wij be the weight associated with the term-document pair [fc$, dj]. If the Wii3 weights are all binary then all possible patterns of term co-occurrence (inside documents) can be represented by a set of2t minterms given by mi = (0,0,..., 0), rn2 = (1,0,. ..,0)7 ..., m2t = (1,1,. ..,1). Let gi(rrij) return the weight {0,1} of the index term kz in the minterm nrij. Thus, the minterm mi (for which gi(mi) = 0, for all i) points to the documents containing none of the index terms. The minterm m2 (for which gi(m2) = 1, for i = l, and #2(7712) = 0, for i gt; 1) points to the documents containing solely the index term k±. Further, the minterm m2t points to the documents containing all the index terms. The central idea in the generalized vector space model is to introduce a set of pairwise orthogonal vectors rhi associated with the set of minterms and to adopt this set of vectors as the basis for the subspace of interest. Definition     Let us define the following set of rhi vectors fax    =    (1,0,...,0,0) m2    =    (0,1,...,0,0) rh2t    =    (0,0,...,0,1) where each vector rhi is associated with the respective minterm m*. Notice that rhi ï fh3 =0 for all i ¶=£ j and thus the set of rhi vectors is, by definition, pairwise orthogonal. This set of rhi vectors is then taken as the orthonormal basis for the generalized vector space model. Pairwise orthogonality among the rhi vectors does not imply independence among the index terms. On the contrary, index terms are now correlated by the rhi vectors. For instance, the vector rh^ is associated with the minterm m4 = (l,l,...,0) which points to the documents in the collection containing the index terms fcx, k2, and no others. If such documents do exist in the collection under consideration then we say that the minterm m4 is active and that a dependence between the index terms A"i and ^2 is induced. If we consider this point more carefully, we notice that the generalized vector model adopts as a basic foundation the idea that co-occurrence of index terms inside documents in the collection induces dependencies among these index terms. Since this is an idea which was introduced many years before the generalized vector space ALTERNATIVE ALGEBRAIC MODELS        43 model itself, novelty is not granted. Instead, the main contribution of the model is the establishment of a formal framework in which dependencies among index terms (induced by co-occurrence patterns inside documents) can be nicely represented. The usage of index term dependencies to improve retrieval performance continues to be a controversial issue. In fact, despite the introduction in the 1980s of more effective algorithms for incorporating term dependencies (see Chapter 5), there is no consensus that incorporation of term dependencies in the model yields effective improvement with general collections. Thus, it is not clear that the framework of the generalized vector model provides a clear advantage in practical situations. Further, the generalized vector model is more complex and computationally more expensive than the classic vector model. To determine the index term vector ki associated with the index term ki, we simply sum up the vectors for all minterms mr in which the term kz is in state 1 and normalize. Thus, ft,    = Y Z-^Vr, d3  | 9i(dj)=9i(mr) for all I These equations provide a general definition for the index term vector ki in terms of the mr vectors. The term vector ki collects all the mr vectors in which the index term ki is in state 1. For each rhT vector, a correlation factor a,r is defined. Such a correlation factor sums up the weights Wij associated with the index term ki and each document dj whose term occurrence pattern coincides exactly with that of the minterm mr. Thus, a minterm is of interest (in which case it is said to be active) only if there is at least one document in the collection which matches its term occurrence pattern. This implies that no more than N minterms can be active, where N is the number of documents in the collection. Therefore, the ranking computation does not depend on an exponential number of minterms as equation 2.5 seems to suggest. Notice that the internal product ki ï kj can now be used to quantify a degree of correlation between the index terms ki and kj. For instance, Ki ï Kj ó-                      y                       £i,r ^ ^j,r Vr i 0t(mr) = l A g3{mr)-l which, as later discussed in Chapter 5, is a good technique for quantifying index term correlations. In the classic vector model, a document dj and a user query q are expressed by d3 = J2viwiJ ^ anc* % = Ylviwi,g ^i, respectively. In the generalized vector space model, these representations can be directly translated to the space of minterm vectors mr by applying equation 2.5.  The resultant dj and q vectors 44        MODELING are then used for computing the ranking through a standard cosine similarity function. The ranking that results from the generalized vector space model combines the standard Wij term-document weights with the correlation factors air-However, since the usage of term-term correlations does not necessarily yield improved retrieval performance, it is not clear in which situations the generalized model outperforms the classic vector model. Furthermore, the cost of computing the ranking in the generalized model can be fairly high with large collections because, in this case, the number of active minterms (i.e., those which have to be considered for computing the ki vectors) might be proportional to the number of documents in the collection. Despite these drawbacks, the generalized vector model does introduce new ideas which are of importance from a theoretical point of view.
