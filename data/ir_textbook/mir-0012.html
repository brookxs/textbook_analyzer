 1.3.3    The Web and Digital Libraries If we consider the search engines on the Web today, we conclude that they continue to use indexes which are very similar to those used by librarians a century ago. What has changed then? Three dramatic and fundamental changes have occurred due to the advances in modern computer technology and the boom of the Web. First, it became a lot cheaper to have access to various sources of information. This allows reaching a wider audience than ever possible before. Second, the advances in all kinds of digital communication provided greater access to networks. This implies that the information source is available even if distantly located and that 8        INTRODUCTION the access can be done quickly (frequently, in a few seconds). Third, the freedom to post whatever information someone judges useful has greatly contributed to the popularity of the Web. For the first time in history, many people have free access to a large publishing medium. Fundamentally, low cost, greater access, and publishing freedom have allowed people to use the Web (and modern digital libraries) as a highly interactive medium. Such interactivity allows people to exchange messages, photos, documents, software, videos, and to 'chat' in a convenient and low cost fashion. Further, people can do it at the time of their preference (for instance, you can buy a book late at night) which further improves the convenience of the service. Thus, high interactivity is the fundamental and current shift in the communication paradigm. Searching the Web is covered in Chapter 13, while digital libraries are covered in Chapter 15. In the future, three main questions need to be addressed. First, despite the high interactivity, people still find it difficult (if not impossible) to retrieve information relevant to their information needs. Thus, in the dynamic world of the Web and of large digital libraries, which techniques will allow retrieval of higher quality? Second, with the ever increasing demand for access, quick response is becoming more and more a pressing factor. Thus, which techniques will yield faster indexes and smaller query response times? Third, the quality of the retrieval task is greatly affected by the user interaction with the system. Thus, how will a better understanding of the user behavior affect the design and deployment of new information retrieval strategies?
