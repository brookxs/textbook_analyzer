 7.2.3 Ranking Algorithms  A by-product of use of similarity measures for selecting Hit items is a value that can be used in ranking the output. Ranking the output implies ordering the output from most likely items that satisfy the query to least likely items. This reduces the user overhead by allowing the user to display the most likely relevant  items first.   The original Boolean systems returned items ordered by date of entry into the system versus by likelihood of relevance to the user's search statement.  With the inclusion of statistical similarity techniques into commercial systems and the large number of hits that originate from searching diverse corpora, such as the  Internet,  ranking has become a common feature of modern systems.  A summary of ranking algorithms from the research community is found in an article written  by Belkin and Croft (Belkin-87).  In most of the commercial systems, heuristic rules are used to assist in the ranking of items. Generally/systems do not want to use factors that require knowledge across the corpus (e.g., inverse document frequency) as a basis for their similarity or ranking functions because it is too difficult to maintain current values as the database changes and the added complexity has not been shown to significantly improve the overall weighting process. A good example of how a commercial   product   integrates   efficiency   with   theoretical   concepts   is   the User Search Techniques                                                                             175  RetrievalWare system's approach to queries and ranking (RETR1EVALWARE95).  RetrievalWare first uses indexes (inversion lists) to identify potential relevant items. It then applies coarse grain and fine grain ranking. The coarse grain ranking is based on the presence of query terms within items. In the fine grain ranking, the exact rank of the item is calculated. The coarse grain ranking is a weighted formula that can be adjusted based on completeness, contextual evidence or variety, and semantic distance. Completeness is the proportion of the number of query terms (or related terms if a query term is expanded using the RetrievalWare semantic network/thesaurus) found in the item versus the number in the query. It sets an upper limit on the rank value for the item. If weights are assigned to query terms, the weights are factored into the value. Contextual evidence occurs when related words from the semantic network are also in the item. Thus if the user has indicated that the query term "charge" has the context of "paying for an object" then finding words such as "buy," "purchase," "debt" suggests that the term "charge" in the item has the meaning the user desires and that more weight should be placed in ranking the item. Semantic distance evaluates how close the additional words are to the query term. Synonyms add additional weight; antonyms decrease weight. The coarse grain process provides an initial rank to the item based upon existence of words within the item. Since physical proximity is not considered in coarse grain ranking, the ranking value can be easily calculated.  Fine grain ranking considers the physical location of query terms and related words using factors of proximity in addition to the other three factors in coarse grain evaluation. If the related terms and query terms occur in close proximity (same sentence or paragraph) the item is judged more relevant. A factor is calculated that maximizes at adjacency and decreases as the physical separation increases. If the query terms are widely distributed throughout a long item, it is possible for the item to have a fine grain rank of zero even though it contains the query terms.  Although ranking creates a ranking score, most systems try to use other ways of indicating the rank value to the user as Hit lists are displayed. The scores have a tendency to be misleading and confusing to the user. The differences between the values may be very close or very large. It has been found to be better to indicate the general relevance of items than to be over specific (see Chapter S).
