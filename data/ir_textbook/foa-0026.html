 2.3.1 Stemming and Other Morphological Processing  From the perspective of linguistics, many of the early design issues we address are considered morphological transformations of language,  i.e., an analysis of what we can infer about language based on structural features. As discussed briefly in Chapter 1, the arbitrary way in which white space may or may not separate tokens whose meanings are interdependant (e.g., recall the German word GESCHWDTOIGKEITS B1SCHRANEUETG and English phrase SPEED LIMIT example) will make us interested in phrasal units of indexing as well. In many Asian texts, the relationship between characters and words is quite radically altered. The Kanji alphabet and Unicode standards help to define the problem but bring biases of their own [Fujii and Croft, 1993],  For now we will focus on one of the most common morphological tricks, stemming. Stemming is a direct attempt to remove certain surface markings from words to reveal root form. Beyond deciding which characters are to be combined into tokens, Chapter 1 discussed how important it can be to use a token's root form as an index term: We can EXTRACTING LEXICAL FEATURES       45  hope that our retrieval is robust even when the query contains the plural form CARS while the document contains the singular CAR. Linguists would say that the number feature (whether a noun is singular or plural) is morphologically marked. Linguists also distinguish between inflectional morphology like plurals, and derivational morphology, which can change a word's syntactic category (e.g., changing the noun PRODUCT to the verb PRODUCTIZE) and meaning more radically.  In stemming, suffixes are dropped. Even in the simple case of plural endings, it isn't as simple as removing ss. Consider:  WOMAN/WOMEN  LEAF/LEAVES  FERRY/PERRIES  ALUMlSniS/ALUMOT  DATUM/DATA  Conversely, we cannot assume that every time there is an ending s we can remove it; stemming CRISIS and CHESS to CRISI and CHES would damage their meaning.  The most common approach to this problem [Fox, 1992] is to identify more elaborate patterns over character sequences that reliably pare tokens down to their root forms. A broad range of such patterns can be defined in terms of a context-sensitive transformation grammar.  For example:  Rule 2.1 t*)SSES-+ /ISS  Rule2.2 (.* [AEIOU].*)ED-gt; /I  Rule2.3 (.* [AEIOU].*)Y-+ /U  Rule 2.1 says that strings ending in -SSES should be transformed by taking the stem (i.e., characters prior to these four) and adding only the two characters SS. Rule 2.2 says that stems containing a vowel and ending in -ED should be transformed to leave only the stem; Rule 2.3 says that stems containing a vowel and ending in -Y should be transformed to the stem with an I replacing the Y.*  * These rules are pseudo-code only, using grep-like syntax for regular expressions. Further, they are meant as illustrative examples. See Fox's chapter for a complete exposition of the actual rules used in Porter's stemmer f Fox, 1992]. 46       FINDING OUT ABOUT  A complete algorithm for stemming involves the specificaton of many such rules and a regime for handling conflicts when multiple rules match the same token. An early and influential algorithm due to Lovins [Lovins, 1968] specified 260 suffix patterns and used an iterative longest match heuristic. This means that first preference is given to the pattern (left-hand side of the grammar rule) that matches the most characters in a target token (because this prefers more specific matches over shorter, more generally applicable ones); then rules are iteratively reapplied until no other rules match.  The Porter stemmer [Porter, 1980] (included as part of the FOA software) is a simplified version of Lovin's technique that uses a reduced set of about 60 rules and organizes them into sets, with conflicts within one subset of rules resolved before going on to the next. In fact, if only the first set of rules in Porter's stemmer (focusing exclusively on plurals and the most straightforward suffixes like -ED and -ING) is used, the result has been called weak stemming [Walker, 1989]. A key advantage of all such rule-based grammatical representations of the stemming process (and of efficient implementations of them, such as that provided by Fox) is that modifications to the rules and to ordering among the rules can be accomplished by changing the grammar rather than by endless ad hoc hacking (ad hacking?:) in response to particular character sequences.  The use of any stemmer obviously reduces the size of the keyword vocabulary and consequently results in a compression of the index files. Such compression can vary from 10 to 50 percent, depending on the total size of the keyword vocabulary and how aggressive (e.g., how many suffix rules are used) the stemmer is.  The primary effect of stemming, however, is that two keywords that were once treated independently are considered interchangeable. Stemming is therefore an example of a recall-increasing operation because it will cause a keyword used in the query to match more documents.  The fundamental problem with any stemming technique, of course, is that the morphological features being stripped away may obscure differences in the words' meanings. For example, the token GRAVITY has two word senses5 one describing an attractive force between any two masses and the other having to do with a serious mood. But once the word GRAVITATION" has been stemmed, we have lost the information that might constrain us to the first interpretation. Krovetz EXTRACTING LEXICAL FEATURES       47  [Krovetz, 1993] considers several more sophisticated approaches to keyword morphology, including augmenting Porter's stemmer with a dictionary that is checked after each phase of stemming rules has been applied.
