 8.3.2    Signature Files Signature files are word-oriented index structures based on hashing. They pose a low overhead (10% to 20% over the text size), at the cost of forcing a sequential search over the index. However, although their search complexity is linear (instead of sublinear as with the previous approaches), its constant is rather low, which makes the technique suitable for not very large texts. Nevertheless, inverted files outperform signature files for most applications. Structure A signature file uses a hash function (or 'signature') that maps words to bit masks of B bits. It divides the text in blocks of b words each. To each text block of size 6, a bit mask of size B will be assigned. This mask is obtained by bitwise ORing the signatures of all the words in the text block. Hence, the signature file is no more than the sequence of bit masks of all blocks (plus a pointer to each block). The main idea is that if a word is present in a text block, then all the bits set in its signature are also set in the bit mask of the text block. Hence, whenever a bit is set in the mask of the query word and not in the mask of the text block, then the word is not present in the text block. Figure 8.11 shows an example. However, it is possible that all the corresponding bits are set even though the word is not there. This is called a false drop. The most delicate part of the design of a signature file is to ensure that the probability of a false drop is low enough while keeping the signature file as short as possible. The hash function is forced to deliver bit masks which have at least £ bits set. A good model assumes that £ bits are randomly set in the mask (with passible repetition).   Let a = £/B.   Since each of the b words sets £ bits at 206        INDEXING AND SEARCHING Block 1                         Block 2                         Block 3 Block 4 This is a text. A text has many words.

Hence, the probability that the £ random bits set in the query are also set in the mask of the text block is which is minimized for a = ln(2)/6. The false drop probability under the optimal selection £ = Bln(2)/b is (i/2ln´2))5/6 = 1/2*. Hence, a reasonable proportion B/b must be determined. The space overhead of the index is approximately (1/80) x (B/b) because B is measured in bits and b in words. Then, the false drop probability is a function of the overhead to pay. For instance, a 10% overhead implies a false drop probability close to 2%, while a 20% overhead errs with probability 0.046%. This error probability corresponds to the expected amount of sequential searching to perform while checking if a match is a false drop or not. Searching Searching a single word is carried out by hashing it to a bit mask W, and then comparing the bit masks B% of all the text blocks. Whenever (W  B{ = W), where  is the bitwise AND, all the bits set in W are also set in B% and therefore the text block may contain the word. Hence, for all candidate text blocks, an online traversal must be performed to verify if the word is actually there. This traversal cannot be avoided as in inverted files (except if the risk of a false drop is accepted). No other types of patterns can be searched in this scheme. On the other hand, the scheme is more efficient to search phrases and reasonable proximity queries. This is because all the words must be present in a block in order for that block to hold the phrase or the proximity query. Hence, the bitwise OR of all the query masks is searched, so that all their bits must be present. This BOOLEAN QUERIES        207 reduces the probability of false drops. This is the only indexing scheme which improves in phrase searching. Some care has to be exercised at block boundaries, however, to avoid missing a phrase which crosses a block limit. To allow searching phrases of j words or proximities of up to j words, consecutive blocks must overlap in j words. If the blocks correspond to retrieval units, simple Boolean conjunctions involving words or phrases can also be improved by forcing all the relevant words to be in the block. We were only able to find real performance estimates from 1992, run on a Sun 3/50 with local disk. Queries on a small 2.8 Mb database took 0.42 seconds. Extrapolating to today's technology, we find that the performance should be close to 20 Mb/sec (recall that it is linear time), and hence the example of 250 Mb of text would take 12 seconds, which is quite slow. Construction The construction of a signature file is rather easy. The text is simply cut in blocks, and for each block an entry of the signature file is generated. This entry is the bitwise OR of the signatures of all the words in the block. Adding text is also easy, since it is only necessary to keep adding records to the signature file. Text deletion is carried out by deleting the appropriate bit masks. Other storage proposals exist apart from storing all the bit masks in sequence. For instance, it is possible to make a different file for each bit of the mask, i.e. one file holding all the first bits, another file for all the second bits, etc. This reduces the disk times to search for a query, since only the files corresponding to the £ bits which are set in the query have to be traversed.
