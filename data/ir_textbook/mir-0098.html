 6.1    Introduction Text is the main form of communicating knowledge. Starting with hieroglyphs, the first written surfaces (stone, wood, animal skin, papyrus, and rice paper), and paper, text has been created everywhere, in many forms and languages. We use the term document to denote a single unit of information, typically text in a digital form, but it can also include other media. In practice, a document is loosely denned. It can be a complete logical unit, like a research article, a book or a manual. It can also be part of a larger text, such as a paragraph or a sequence of paragraphs (also called a passage of text), an entry in a dictionary, a judge's opinion on a case, the description of an automobile part, etc. Furthermore, with respect to its physical representation, a document can be any physical unit, for example a file, an email, or a World Wide Web (or just Web) page. A document has a given syntax and structure which is usually dictated by the application or by the person who created it. It also has a semantics, specified by the author of the document (who is not necessarily the same as the creator). Additionally, a document may have a presentation style associated with it, which specifies how it should be displayed or printed. Such a style is usually given by the document syntax and structure and is related to a specific application (for example, a Web browser). Figure 6.1 depicts all these relations. A document can also have information about itself, called metadata. The next section explains different types of metadata and their relevance. The syntax of a document can express structure, presentation style, semantics, or even external actions. In many cases one or more of these elements are implicit or are given together. For example, a structural element (e.g., a section) can have a fixed formatting style. The semantics of a document is also associated with its use. For example, Postscript directives are designed for drawing. The syntax of a document can be implicit in its content, or expressed in a simple declarative language or even in a programming language. For example, many editor formats are declarative while a TeX document uses a powerful typesetting language. Although a powerful language could be easier to parse than the data itself, it might be difficult to convert documents in that language to other formats.  Many syntax languages are proprietary and specific, but open 141 142        TEXT AND MULTIMEDIA LANGUAGES AND PROPERTIES Document Syntax Text + Structure + Other Media Presentation Style Semantics Figure 6.1    Characteristics of a document. and generic languages are better because documents can be interchanged between applications and are more flexible. Text can also be written in natural language. However, at present the semantics of natural language is still not easy for a computer to understand. The current trend is to use languages which provide information on the document structure, format, and semantics while being readable by humans as well as computers. The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), which is covered later on in this chapter, tries to balance all the issues above. Metadata, markup, and semantic encoding represent different levels of formalization of the document contents. Most documents have a particular formatting style. However, new applications are pushing for external formatting such that information can be represented independently of style, and vice versa. The presentation style can be embedded in the document, as in TeX or Rich Text Format (RTF). Style can be complemented by macros (for example, LaTeX in the case of TeX). In most cases, style is defined by the document author. However, the reader may decide part of the style (for example, by setting options in a Web browser). The style of a document defines how the document is visualized in a computer window or a printed page, but can also include treatment of other media such as audio or video. In this chapter we first cover metadata. Following that we discuss text characteristics such as formats and natural language statistics. Next we cover languages to describe text structure, presentation style, or semantics. The last part is devoted to multimedia formats and languages.
