 3.4.3 Summary: SMART Weighting Specification  Although the variety of potential keyword weighting schemes (signal/noise, IDF, keyword discrimination, etc.) may seem large, there is  in fact a systematicity to this variation.  SMART is an extremely influential and widely used software system for investigating IR techniques [Salton, 1971; Buckley, 1985]. One secret of its success is that SMART provides a simple parameter-driven mechanism for easily changing from one form of index weighting to another.  In SMART, the weight is decomposed into three factors:  = freqkd * discrim,                          ^  norm WEIGHTING AND MATCHING AGAINST INDICES       93  Each of these components can then be specified independently:  freclkd =  discrimk =  {0,1} binary  fkd maxNorm  max(fkd) k  i,i    fkd augmented  2      2max(fkd) k  In {fkd) + 1 log  NDoc   log  inverse  1        ND0CV                  A  log------- )         squared  Dk  )  NDoc- Dk         .,.,.,. log-------รณ-------    probabilistic  1 At  Dk  frequency  norm =  r 2_\ wi      sum  2  fourth  max(iy;)    max  I   vector  (3.33)  (3.34)  (3.35)
