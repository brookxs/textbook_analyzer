 8.5.4    Shift-Or Shift-Or is based on hit-parallelism. This technique involves taking advantage of the intrinsic parallelism of the bit operations inside a computer word (of w bits). By cleverly using this fact, the number of operations that an algorithm performs can be cut by a factor of at most w. Since in current architectures w is 32 or 64. the speedup is very significant in practice. The Shift-Or algorithm uses bit-parallelism to simulate the operation of a non-deterministic automaton that searches the pattern in the text (see Figure 3.17). As this automaton is simulated in time O(mn), the Shift-Or algorithm achieves O(ninfir) worst-case time (optimal speedup). The algorithm first builds a table B which for each character stores a bit mask hm...bi.  The mask in B[c] has the i-th bit set to zero if and only if SEQUENTIAL		SEARCHING			213 gt;x	-N        C      ï-	gt;M	--n   d   /ó				a óªï	© B[a} =	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1 B[b] =	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0 SW =	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0 B[c] =	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0 B[d] =	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0 B\*] =	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0 Figure 8.17 Non-deterministic automaton that searches 'abracadabra,1 and the associated B table. The initial self-loop matches any character. Each table column corresponds to an edge of the automaton. pi = c (see Figure 8.17). The state of the search is kept in a machine word D = dm...di, where d{ is zero whenever the state numbered i in Figure 8.17 is active. Therefore, a match is reported whenever dm is zero. In the following, we use to denote the bitwise OR and c' to denote the bitwise AND. D is set to all ones originally, and for each new text character T3, D is updated using the formula D'   lt;-    (£gt;´ 1)   |   B[Tj] (where 'lt;lt;' means shifting all the bits in D one position to the left and setting the rightmost bit to zero). It is not hard to relate the formula to the movement that occurs in the non-deterministic automaton for each new text character. For patterns longer than the computer word (i.e., m gt; ir), the algorithm uses \m/w'] computer words for the simulation (not all them are active all the time). The algorithm is O(n) on average and the preprocessing is O(m + a) time and O(cr) space. It is easy to extend Shift-Or to handle classes of characters by manipulating the B table and keeping the search algorithm unchanged. This paradigm also can search a large set of extended patterns, as well as multiple patterns (where the complexity is the same as before if we consider that m is the total length of all the patterns).
