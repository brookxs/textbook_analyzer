 15.4.3    Structured Documents While multimedia depends on the stream abstraction, structured documents require both the abstractions of streams and structures. Indeed, structured documents in their essence are streams with one or more structures imposed. 422        DIGITAL LIBRARIES often by the insertion of markup in the stream, but sometimes through a separate external structure, like pointers in hypertext. Since Chapter 6 of this book covers many of the key issues of document structure, we focus in this section on issues of particular relevance to digital librarys [288]. For example, since digital librarys typically include both documents and metadata describing them, it is important to realize that metadata as in MARC records can be represented as an SGML document (see Chapter 6 for more details) and that SGML content can be included in the base document and/or be kept separately [293]. Structure is often important in documents when one wants to add value or make texts 'smart' [167]. It can help identify important concepts [626]. SGML is often used to describe structure since most documents fall into one or more common logical structures [750], that can be formally described using a Document Type Definition (DTD). Another type of structure that is important in digital librarys, as well as earlier paper forms, results from annotation [548]. In this case stream and structure are supplemented by scenarios since annotations result from users interacting with a document collection, as well as collaborating with each other through these shared artifacts [680]. Structure is also important in retrieval. Macleod was one of the first to describe special concerns related to IR involving structured documents [533]. Searching on structure as well as content remains one of the distinguishing advantages of IR systems like OpenText (formerly 'PAT' [38]). Ongoing work considers retrieval with structured documents, such as with patterns and hierarchical texts [439]. An alternative approach, at the heart of much of the work in the Berkeley digital libraryI project [775], shifts the burden of handling structure in documents to the user, by allowing multiple layers of filters and tools to operate on so-called 'multivalent documents' [774]. Thus, a page image including a table can be analyzed with a table tool that understands the table structure and sorts it by considering the values in a user-selected column. Structure at the level above documents, that is, of collections of documents, is what makes searching necessary and possible. It also is a defining characteristic of digital librarys, especially when the collections are distributed.
