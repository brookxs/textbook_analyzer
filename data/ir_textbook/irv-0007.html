 Effectiveness and efficiency  Much of the research and development in information retrieval is aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of retrieval. Efficiency is usually measured in terms of the computer resources used such as core, backing store, and C.P.U. time. It is difficult to measure efficiency in a machine independent way. In any case, it should be measured in conjunction with effective-ness to obtain some idea of the benefit in terms of unit cost. In the previous section I mentioned that effectiveness is commonly measured in terms of precision and recall. I repeat here that precision is the ratio of the number of relevant documents retrieved to the total number of documents retrieved, and recall is the ratio of the number of relevant documents retrieved to the total number of relevant documents (both retrieved and not retrieved). The reason for emphasising these two measures is that frequent reference is made to retrieval effectiveness but its detailed discussion is delayed until Chapter 7. It will suffice until we reach that chapter to think of retrieval effectiveness in terms of precision and recall. It would have been possible to give the chapter on evaluation before any of the other material but this, in my view, would have been like putting the cart before the horse. Before we can appreciate the evaluation of observations we need to understand what gave rise to the observations. Hence I have delayed discussing evaluation until some understanding of what makes an information retrieval system tick has been gained. Readers not satisfied with this order can start by first reading Chapter 7 which in any case can be read independently.
