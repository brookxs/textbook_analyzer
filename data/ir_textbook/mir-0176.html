 9.5    Bibliographic Discussion A thorough overview of parallel and distributed computing can be found in the Parallel and Distributed Computing Handbook [852], edited by Albert Zomaya. Many interesting research papers specific to parallel and distributed information systems can be found in the proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Information Systems. Stanfill et al [742, 744, 740] are responsible for much of the early work using massively parallel hardware (in particular, the Thinking Machines Connection Machine) to solve IR problems. Pogue and Willet [645] also explored massively parallel IR using the ICL Distributed Array Processor. Salton and Buckley [701] provide some interesting comments on the early implementations of parallel IR, challenging both their speed and effectiveness. Lu et al [524] analyze how to properly scale SMP hardware for parallel IR and emphasize the importance of proper hardware balance. Investigations into parallel and distributed inverted file implementations have been performed by Tomasic and Garcia-Molina [762, 763, 764], Jeong and Omiecinski [404], and Ribeiro-Neto and Barbosa [673]. Parallel and distributed algorithms for suffix array construction and search have been explored by Navarro et al. [591]. Given P processors and total text of size n, they obtain average indexing times that are O(n/P logn) CPU time and 0{n/P) communication time. Macleod et al [535] offer a number of strategies and tips for building distributed information retrieval systems. Cahoon and McKinley [137] analyze the performance of the Inquery distributed information retrieval system. Source selection and collection fusion issues have been investigated by Gra-vano et al using the G1OSS system [318], Voorhees et al [792], Callan et al [139], Moffat arid Zobel [574], Viles and French [787], and others.
