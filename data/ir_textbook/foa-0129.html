  INFERENCE BEYOND THE INDEX      223  to the Ph.D. advisor/advisee relationship. David Waltz's taxonomy of AI provides an excellent initial thesaurus over keywords [Waltz, 1985.]  6.4.2 An Empirical Foundation for a Philosophy of Science  One advantage of studying a focused corpus like the AIT is that we have an especially good chance of understanding some of these social relations. A history of AI often begins with a seminal conference that took place at Dartmouth in 1956 [McCorduck, 1985; Russell and Norvig, 1995] .t If we    Alternate treat the attendees at that meeting as "founding fathers" (in a population    histories genetic sense!), we can attempt to track their "genetic" impact on the current field of AI.                                                                                 ?S  In an attempt to capture other significant intellectual influences beyond the advisor, the AIG questionnaire asks for committee members other than the chairman. The role of committee members varies a great deal from department to department and from campus to campus. But all of these numbers can be expected to exert some intellectual influence. Asking for committee members is a step toward other nonadvisor influencers, and it is also a matter of record. Research institutions are another way to capture intellectual interactions among collaborators.  Even if and when the AI-Ph.D. family tree is completed, it will certainly not have captured all of what we mean by "artificial intelligence research." For example:  ï  The Dartmouth "founding fathers" probably provide (direct) lineage for a minority of AI Ph.D.s currently working in the field.  ï  Ph.D. theses themselves are probably some of the worst examples of research, in AI and elsewhere. By definition, we are talking about students who are doing some of their first work. They had better improve with time!  ï  Ph.D.s account for only a fraction of AI research.  Nevertheless, science is primarily concerned with accumulating knowledge, at least as much as it is about its initial discovery. A primary argument for interest in the AIG is that traditional academic 224      FINDING OUT ABOUT  relationships, as embodied by Ph.D. genealogies, form a sort of "skeleton" around which the rest of scientific knowledge coalesces. Certainly, individuals can pursue their own research program, and corporations can fund extended investigations into areas that are not represented in academia whatsoever. But it is hard to imagine extended research programs (like that "fathered" by Roger Schank, for example) that do not involve multiple "generations" of investigators; academia is almost certainly the most successful system for such propagation. Further, clear demonstrations of intellectual lineages like this promise much more concrete evidence for memes - the hypothetical analogs of biological genes in cultural systems [Dawkins, 1976] - than analyses of text alone [Best, 2000] can ever provide.  Kuhnian [Kuhn, 1970] andpost-Kuhnian [Hull, 1988;Latour, 1987] analyses highlight the importance of the social aspects of science. "Paradigms" are extremely appealing constructs, but they're also amorphous. For all of its faults, the AI-Ph.D. tree represents incontrovertible facts, just as word frequencies do.
