 4.2.3 Dictionary Look-Up Stemmers  An alternative to solely relying on algorithms to determine a stem is to use a dictionary look-up mechanism. In this approach, simple stemming rules still may be applied. The rules are taken from those that have the fewest exceptions (e.g., removing pluralization from nouns). But even the most consistent rules have exceptions that need to be addressed. The original term or stemmed version of the term is looked up in a dictionary and replaced by the stem that best represents it. This technique has been implemented in the INQUERY and RetrievalWare Systems.  The INQUERY system uses a stemming technique called Kstem. Kstem is a morphological analyzer that conflates word variants to a root form (Kstem-95). It tries to avoid collapsing words with different meanings into the same root. For example, "memorial" and "memorize" reduce to "memory." But "memorial" and "memorize" are not synonyms and have very different meanings. Kstem, like other stemmers associated with Natural Language Processors and dictionaries, returns words instead of truncated word forms. Generally, Kstem requires a word to be in the dictionary before it reduces one word form to another. Some endings are always removed, even if the root form is not found in the dictionary (e.g., 4ness', 'ly'). If the word being processed is in the dictionary, it is assumed to be unrelated to the root after stemming and conflation is not performed (e.g., 'factorial' needs to be in the dictionary or it is stemmed to 'factory'). For irregular morphologies, it is necessary to explicitly map the word variant to the root desired (for example, "matrices" to "matrix").  The Kstem system uses the following six major data files to control and limit the stemming process:  Dictionary of words (lexicon)  Supplemental list of words for the dictionary  Exceptions list for those words that should retain an "e" at the end (e.g., "suites" to "suite" but "suited" to "suit")  DirectConflation - allows definition of direct conflation via  word pairs that override the stemming algorithm  Country_Nationality - conflations between nationalities and countries ("British" maps to "Britain") 78                                                                                               Chapter 4  Proper Nouns - a list of proper nouns that should not be stemmed.  The strength of the Retrieval Ware System lies in its Thesaurus/Semantic Network support data structure that contains over 400,000 words. The dictionaries that are used contain the morphological variants of words. New words that are not special forms (e.g., dates, phone numbers) are located in the dictionary to determine simpler forms by stripping off suffixes and respelling plurals as defined in the dictionary.
