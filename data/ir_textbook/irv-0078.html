 Relevance  Relevance is a subjective notion. Different users may differ about the relevance or non-relevance of particular documents to given questions. However, the difference is not large enough to invalidate experiments which have been made with document collections for which test questions with corresponding relevance assessments are available. These questions are usually elicited from bona fide users, that is, users in a particular discipline who have an information need. The relevance assessments are made by a panel of experts in that discipline. So we now have the situation where a number of questions exist for which the 'correct' responses are known. It is a general assumption in the field of IR that should a retrieval strategy fare well under a large number of experimental conditions then it is likely to perform well in an operational situation where relevance is not known in advance.  There is a concept of relevance which can be said to be objective and which deserves mention as an interesting source of speculation. This notion of relevance has been explicated by Cooper[4]. It is properly termed 'logical relevance'. Its usefulness in present day retrieval systems is limited. However, it can be shown to be of some importance when it is related to the development of question-answering systems, such as the one recently designed by T. Winograd at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Logical relevance is most easily explicated if the questions are restricted to the yes-no type. This restriction may be lifted - for details see Cooper's original paper. Relevance is defined in terms of logical consequence. To make this possible a question is represented by a set of sentences. In the case of a yes-no question it is represented by two formal statements of the form 'p' and 'not-p'. For example, if the query were 'Is hydrogen a halogen element?', the part of statements would be the formal language equivalent of 'Hydrogen is a halogen element' and 'Hydrogen is not a halogen element'. More complicated questions of the 'which' and 'whether' type can be transformed in this manner, for details the reader is referred to Belnap[5,6]. If the two statements representing the question are termed component statements then the subset of the set of stored sentences is a premiss set for a component statement if an only if the component statement is a logical consequence of that subset. (Note we are now temporarily talking about stored sentences rather than stored documents.) A minimal premiss set for a component statement is one that is as small as possible in the sense that if any of its members were deleted, the component statement would no longer be a logical consequence of the resulting set. Logical relevance is now defined as a two-place relation between stored sentences and information need representations (that is, the question represented as component statements). The final definition is as follows:  A stored sentence is logically relevant to (a representation of) an information need if and only if it is a member of some minimal premiss set of stored sentences for some component statement of that need.  Although logical relevance is initially only defined between sentences it can easily be extended to apply to stored documents. A document is relevant to an information need if and only if it contains at least one sentence which is relevant to that need.  Earlier on I stated that this notion of relevance was only of limited use at the moment. The main reason for this is that the kind of system which would be required to implement a retrieval strategy which would retrieve only the logically relevant documents has not been built yet. However, the components of such a system do exist to a certain extent. Firstly, theorem provers, which can prove theorems within formal languages such as the first-order predicate calculus, have reached quite a level of sophistication now (see, for example, Chang and Lee[7]). Secondly, Winograd's system is capable of answering questions about its simple universe blocks in natural language. In principle this system could be extended to construct a universe of documents, that is, the content of a document is analysed and incorporated into the universe of currently 'understood' documents. It may be that the scale of a system of this kind will be too large for present day computers; only the future will tell.  Saracevic[8] has given a thorough review of the notion of relevance in information science. Robertson[9] has summarised some of the more recent work on probabilistic interpretations of relevance.
