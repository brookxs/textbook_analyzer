 2.1.7 Concept/Thesaurus Expansion  Associated with both Boolean and Natural Language Queries is the ability to expand the search terms via Thesaurus or Concept Class database reference tool. A Thesaurus is typically a one-level or two-level expansion of a term to other terms that are similar in meaning. A Concept Class is a tree structure that expands each meaning of a word into potential concepts that are related to the initial term (e.g., in the TOPIC system). Concept classes are sometimes implemented as a network structure that links word stems (e.g., in the RetrievalWare system). An example of Thesaurus and Concept Class structures are shown in Figure 2.4 (Thesaurus-93) and Figure 2.5. Concept class representations assist a user who has minimal knowledge of a concept domain by allowing the user to expand upon a particular concept showing related concepts. A concept based database shows associations that are not normally found in a language based thesaurus. For example, "negative advertising" may be linked to "elections" in a concept database, but are hopefully not synonyms to be found in a thesaurus. Generalization is associated with the user viewing concepts logically higher in a hierarchy that have more general meaning. Specificity is going lower in the thesaurus looking at concepts that are more specific.  Thesauri are either semantic or based upon statistics. A semantic thesaurus is a listing of words and then other words that are semantically similar. Electronic versions of thesauri are commercially available and are language based (e.g., English, Spanish, etc.). Systems such as RetrievalWare and TOPIC provide them as part of the search system. In executing a query, a term can be expanded to all related terms in the thesaurus or concept tree. Optionally, the user may display the thesaurus or concept tree and indicate which related terms should be used in a query. This function is essential to eliminate synonyms which introduce meanings that are not in the user's search statement. For example, a user searching on "pasture lands" and "fields" would not want all of the terms associated with "magnetic fields" included in the expanded search statement.  The capability usually exists to browse the thesaurus or concept trees and add additional terms and term relationships in the case of concept trees. This allows users to enhance the thesaurus or concept tree with jargon specific to their area of interest.

An alternative uses the database or a representative sample of it to create statistically related terms. It is conceptually a thesaurus in that words that are statistically related to other words by their frequently occurring together in the same items. This type of thesaurus is very dependent upon the database being searched and may not be portable to other databases. The statistical techniques for generating a thesaurus are discussed in detail in Chapter 6. Irs a statistical thesaurus it is very difficult to name a thesaurus class or understand by viewing it 36                                                                                                Chapter 2  what caused its creation (i.e., there is not a semantic basis defining the classes). As such, statistical thesauri are frequently used as automatic expansions of user's searches without the user directly interacting with the thesaurus.  Theoretically thesauri and concept trees could be used to either expand a search statement with additional terms or make it more specific but substituting more specific terms. From this perspective expanding the terms increases the recall of the search with a possible decrease in precision. Going to more specific terms increases precision and possibly reduce recall. In most cases the generalization process is used in expanding a search statement with more terms.
