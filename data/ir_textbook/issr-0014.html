 2.1 Search Capabilities  The objective of the search capability is to allow for a mapping between a user's specified need and the items in the information database that will answer that need. The search query statement is the means that the user employs to communicate a description of the needed information to the system. It can consist of natural language text in composition style and/or query terms (referred to as terms in this book) with Boolean logic indicators between them. How the system translates the search query into processing steps to find the potential relevant items is described in later chapters. One concept that has occasionally been implemented in commercial systems (e.g., RetrievalWare), and holds significant potential for assisting in the location and ranking of relevant items, is the "weighting" of search terms. This would allow a user to indicate the importance of search terms in either a Boolean or natural language interface. Given the following natural language query statement where the importance of a particular search term is indicated by a value in parenthesis between 0.0 and 1.0 with 1.0 being the most important:  Find articles that discuss automobile emissions(.9) or sulfur dioxide(.3) on the farming industry.  the system would recognize in its importance ranking and item selection process that automobile emissions are far more important than items discussing sulfur dioxide problems.  The search   statement may apply to the  complete  item  or  contain  additional parameters limiting it to a logical division of the item (i.e., to a zone).  As discussed in Chapter 1, this restriction is useful in reducing retrieval of nonrelevant items by limiting the search to those subsets of the item whose use of a  particular word is consistent with the user's search objective. Finding a name in a Bibliography does not necessarily mean the item is about that person. Recent research has shown that for longer items, restricting a query statement to be satisfied within a contiguous subset of the document (passage searching) provides improved precision (Buckley-95, Wilkinson-95). Rather than allowing the search statement to be satisfied anywhere within a document it may be required to be satisfied within a 100 word contiguous subset of the item (Callan-94).  Based upon the algorithms used in a system many different fiinctions are associated with the system's understanding the search statement. The fiinctions define the relationships between the terms in the search statement (e.g., Boolean, Information Retrieval System Capabilities                                                     29  Natural Language, Proximity, Contiguous Word Phrases, and Fuzzy Searches) and the interpretation of a particular word (e.g., Term Masking, Numeric and Date Range, Contiguous Word Phrases, and Concept/Thesaurus expansion).  Rather than continuing the use of the term processing token to represent the searchable units extracted from an item, the terminology "word" or "term" is also used in some contexts as an approximation that is intuitively more meaningful to the reader.
