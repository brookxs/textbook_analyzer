As discussed in Chapter 2, the search statement uses traditional Boolean logic and/or Natural Language. In generation of the search statement, the user may have the ability to weight (assign an importance) to different concepts in the statement. At this point the binding is to the vocabulary and past experiences of the user. Binding in this sense is when a more abstract form is redefined into a more specific form. The search statement is the user's attempt to specify the conditions needed to subset logically the total item space to that cluster of items that contains the information needed by the user.  The next level of binding comes when the search statement is parsed for use by a specific search system. The search system translates the query to its own metalanguage. This process is similar to the indexing of item processes described in Chapter 5. For example, statistical systems determine the processing tokens of interest and the weights assigned to each processing token based upon frequency of occurrence from the search statement. Natural language systems determine the syntactical and discourse semantics using algorithms similar to those used in indexing. Concept systems map the search statement to the set of concepts used to index items.  The final level of binding comes as the search is applied to a specific database. This binding is based upon the statistics of the processing tokens in the database and the semantics used in the database. This is especially true in statistical and concept indexing systems. Some of the statistics used in weighting are based upon the current contents of the database. Some examples are Document Frequency and Total Frequency for a specific term. Frequently in a concept indexing system, the concepts that are used as the basis for indexing are determined by applying a statistical algorithm against a representative sample of the database versus being generic across all databases (see Chapter 5). Natural Language indexing techniques tend to use the most corpora-independent algorithms. Figure 7.1 illustrates the three potential different levels of binding. Parenthesis are used in the second binding step to indicate expansion by a thesaurus.  The length of search statements directly affect the ability of Information Retrieval Systems to find relevant items. The longer the search query, the easier it is for the system to find items. Profiles used as search statements for Selective Dissemination of Information systems are usually very long, typically 75 to 100 terms. In large systems used by research specialists and analysts, the typical ad hoc search statement is approximately 7 terms. In a paper to be published in SIGIR-97, Fox et al. at Virginia Tech have noted that the typical search statement on the Internet is one or two words. These extremely short search statements for ad hoc queries significantly reduce the effectiveness of many of the techniques User Search Techniques                                                                             167  INPUT                                                     Binding  "Find   me   information    on    the           User     search     statement     using  impact of the oil spills in Alaska on           vocabulary of user the price of oil"  impact,    oil    (petroleum),    spills           Statistical system binding extracts  (accidents),   Alaska,   price   (cost,           processing tokens  value)  impact (.308), oil (.606), petroleum           Weights assigned to search   terms  (.65), spills (.12), accidents (.23),           based    upon    inverse    document  Alaska (.45), price (.16), cost (.25),           frequency algorithm and database value (.10)  Figure 7.1 Examples of Query Binding  whose performance is discussed in Chapter 10 and are requiring investigation into new automatic search expansion algorithms.
