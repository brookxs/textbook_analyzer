 72  Chapter 4  4.1 Introduction to Data Structures  There are usually two major data structures in any information system. One structure stores and manages the received items in their normalized form. The process supporting this structure is called the "document manager." The other major data structure contains the processing tokens and associated data to support search. Figure 4.1 expands the document file creation function in Figure 1.4 from Chapter 1, showing the document manager function. Details on the creation of processing tokens can be found in Section 1.3.1. The results of a search are references to the items that satisfy the search statement, which are passed to the document manager for retrieval. This chapter focuses on data structures used to support the search function. It does not address the document management function nor the data structures and other related theory associated with the parsing of queries. For that background the reader should pursue a text on finite automata and language (regular expressions).

Stemming reduces the diversity of representations of a concept (word) to a canonical morphological representation. The risk with stemming is that concept discrimination information may be lost in the process, causing a decrease in precision and the ability for ranking to be performed. On the positive side, stemming has the potential to improve recall.  The most common data structure encountered in both data base and information systems is the inverted file system (discussed in Section 4.3). It minimizes secondary storage access when multiple search terms are applied across the total database. All commercial and most academic systems use inversion as the searchable data structure. A variant of the searchable data structure is the N-gram structure that breaks processing tokens into smaller string units (which is why it is sometimes discussed under stemming) and uses the token fragments for search. Ngrams have demonstrated improved efficiencies and conceptual manipulations over full word inversion. PAT trees and arrays view the text of an item as a single long stream versus a juxtaposition of words. Around this paradigm search algorithms are defined based upon text strings. Signature files are based upon the idea of fast elimination of non-relevant items reducing the searchable items to a manageable subset. The subset can be returned to the user for review or other search algorithms may be applied to it to eliminate any false hits that passed the signature filter.  A special data structure that is becoming common place because of its use on the Internet is hypertext. This structure allows the creator of an item to manually or automatically create imbedded links within one item to a related item.
