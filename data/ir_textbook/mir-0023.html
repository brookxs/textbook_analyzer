 2.1    Introduction Traditional information retrieval systems usually adopt index terms to index and retrieve documents. In a restricted sense, an index term is a keyword (or group of related words) which has some meaning of its own (i.e., which usually has the semantics of a noun). In its more general form, an index term is simply any word which appears in the text of a document in the collection. Retrieval based on index terms is simple but raises key questions regarding the information retrieval task. For instance, retrieval using index terms adopts as a fundamental foundation the idea that the semantics of the documents and of the user information need can be naturally expressed through sets of index terms. Clearly, this is a considerable oversimplification of the problem because a lot of the semantics in a document or user request is lost when we replace its text with a set of words. Furthermore, matching between each document and the user request is attempted in this very imprecise space of index terms. Thus, it is no surprise that the documents retrieved in response to a user request expressed as a set of keywords are frequently irrelevant. If one also considers that most users have no training in properly forming their queries, the problem is worsened with potentially disastrous results. The frequent dissatisfaction of Web users with the answers they normally obtain is just one good example of this fact. Clearly, one central problem regarding information retrieval systems is the issue of predicting which documents are relevant and which are not. Such a decision is usually dependent on a ranking algorithm which attempts to establish a simple ordering of the documents retrieved. Documents appearing at the top of this ordering are considered to be more likely to be relevant. Thus, ranking algorithms are at the core of information retrieval systems. A ranking algorithm operates according to basic premises regarding the notion of document relevance. Distinct sets of premises (regarding document relevance) yield distinct information retrieval models. The IR model adopted determines the predictions of what is relevant and what is not (i.e., the notion of relevance implemented by the system). The purpose of this chapter is to cover the most Important Information retrieval models proposed over the years.  By 19 20        MODELING doing so, the chapter also provides a conceptual basis for most of the remaining chapters in this book. We first propose a taxonomy for categorizing the 15 IR models we cover. Second, we distinguish between two types of user retrieval tasks: ad hoc and filtering. Third, we present a formal characterization of IR models which is useful for distinguishing the various components of a particular model. Last, we discuss each of the IR models included in our taxonomy.
