 14.2.3    IR in Online Retrieval Systems Since the inception of these online retrieval services, their retrieval functionality has been based primarily on the Boolean model for retrieval, in contrast to research in the IR field which has focused on improving retrieval performance through non-Boolean models, such as the vector space model (see Chapter 2). A number of factors guided the choice of the Boolean model as the basis for these services. Research in indexing and retrieval at the time, particularly the Cran-field studies, a series of experiments comparing natural and controlled vocabulary indexing, suggested that 'natural language' retrieval provided a level of retrieval performance comparable to manual indexing. Boolean logic was already being used in some libraries for manual retrieval systems, such as edge-notched cards and optical coincidence cards, and seemed to offer a natural mechanism for implementing retrieval based on combinations of words in documents. Research on alternate retrieval models was in its infancy, and the effectiveness of these models had not been proven for large databases. Most significantly, perhaps, the limited processing and storage capability of the computers of the time, while enough to support the inverted file structures and logical operations required for Boolean retrieval in an online environment, could not provide real time retrieval performance for other retrieval models which were more computationally intensive. Despite developments in IR research which suggested that alternative models might provide improved retrieval performance, Boolean retrieval has remained the commonest access method offered by database vendors, although in recent years some systems have added a form of natural language input with ranked output processing as an alternative access method. Reasons that have been suggested for the predominance of Boolean searching include financial considerations (cost of major changes in search software and database structures), service issues (a client community trained on existing systems), and lack of evidence in ONLINE IR SYSTEMS AND DOCUMENT DATABASES        405 support of viable alternatives in operational environments [662]. In general, database vendors use proprietary search software which is specific to their system, so that information professionals who search multiple systems are required to learn a different command vocabulary for each. A standard has been developed for a Common Command Language, NISO Z39.58 or ISO 8777, as described in Chapter 4, but it does not substitute for the advanced search features which are unique to individual search systems. The basic functionality for an IR search system is the ability to search for single terms or phrases, or Boolean combinations of them, to create sets of documents that can be further manipulated, then printed or displayed. Typically the system will also offer the option of using proximity operators to specify term relationships (A adjacent to B, A within n words of B, etc.) as discussed in Chapter 5, and to specify the location of the search term within the record (A occurring in title field, B occurring in the descriptor field, etc.). Of course, these capabilities require the storage of a significant amount of positional information within the inverted index. Other functions that may be available are the ability to browse the database index to select search terms (see Chapter 10) or to follow the term relationships within a database thesaurus to find candidate search terms (see Chapter 7). Other, more sophisticated functions, perhaps associated with a specific category of database, are also available, such as the ability to conduct structural searches for compounds in a chemistry database. As a term is entered by a searcher, the system creates a 'set' corresponding to all documents containing that term, and assigns a set number for the searcher's use. Multiple sets of retrieved documents are maintained in temporary storage. These set numbers serve as surrogates for the document set when issuing search commands, and Boolean logic can be used to manipulate existing sets. A display command allows the searcher to review the search history and return to previous sets. Based on data about the size of a set retrieved with search term or expression, and a review of the associated documents and their indexing, searchers continually revise a search until they feel they have achieved the best possible outcome. This iterative process is as much art as science, and its success is highly dependent on the skill and subject knowledge of the searcher. A typical Boolean search on DIALOG is shown in Figure 14.6. In this search, the user requests a specific database (file 61, Library and Information Science Abstracts) and then uses the 'Select Steps' or ss command to create sets of records. The '(w)1 represents a proximity operator, so set 5 (S5) will contain all records containing the phrases 'document retrieval' or 'text retrieval*1 or 'information retrieval.1 Set 13 (S13) will contain all records containing the term 'OPAC or the phrase 'online public access catalog.' The k?' is a truncation operator, and l? ?' limits truncation to one letter, so alternate spellings and plural of "catalog' and the singular or plural of 'OPAC will be retrieved. The two sets are combined with a Boolean AND operator, and finally the set is further limited to records that contain the terms in the title (ti) or descriptor (de) field, resulting in 100 records for review. 406        LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS begin 61 File 61:LISA(LIBRARYINF0SCI)  1969-1998/May (c)	1998 Reed Reference Publishing Set	Items	Description ? ss (document or		information or text)(w)retrieval SI	7363	DOCUMENT S2	92299	INFORMATION S3	6219	TEXT S4	29302	RETRIEVAL S5	15338	(DOCUMENT OR INFORMATION OR TEXT)(W)RETRIEVAL ? ss opac?	? or online(w)public(w)access(w)catalog?
