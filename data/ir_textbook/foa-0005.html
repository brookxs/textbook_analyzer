 1.2.1 Elements of the Query Language  If the query comes from a student during office hours or from a patron at a reference librarian's desk, the query language theyll use to frame their question is entirely natural, that most expressive "mother tongue" familiar to both question-asker and -answerer. But for the software search engines we will consider, we must assume a much more constrained "artificial" query language. Like other languages, ours will have both a meaningful vocabulary - the set of important keywords any user is allowed to mention in any queries - and a syntax that allows us to construct more elaborate query structures.
