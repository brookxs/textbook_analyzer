 63.1 Automatic Thesaurus Construction  Before considering WordNet, another elaborate thesaurus, it is useful to relate these manually constructed representations with automatic, statistically derived analogs. Such comparisons have been part of IR research since its beginnings [Joyce and Needham, 1958; Dennis, 1964; Soergel, 1974]. Section 5.2.5 has discussed how the same information used to cluster documents can be used with keywords. The semantics of relations based strictly on cooccurrence frequencies are not obvious [van Rijsbergen, 1977] but seem to provide evidence for the RT (related term, or synonymy relation) discussed earlier.  Using this information to construct hierarchic relations among keywords corresponds to (hierarchic) clustering techniques. Thesaurusspecific techniques generally exploit a heuristic that high-frequency keywords correspond to broad, general terms while low-frequency keywords correspond to narrow, specific ones [Srinivasan, 1992]. This heuristic can be used to organize keywords into levels of a taxonomy, with the hierarchic parent/child relation formed between those keywords with similar document distributions. relevance feedback can also be used to provide thesaurus structure[Guntzer et al, 1989]. Whether constructed manually or automatically, thesuarus structures support many new forms of navigation [Rada and Bicknell, 1989; McMath et al., 1989].  Ellipses are used to elide some parts of this display: other types of LYMPHOMA, MOH-HODGKIM and the redundant children of LYMPHOMA expanded In the second two tree locations. 212      FINDING OUT ABOUT  Netscape: MeSH Browser i  ;   Back      Forward    Reload       Home      Search      Guide      Images      Print     Security  islt;;££^jlfc^  Eater another MsSH term to frrowse  A general term for various aeo$kstic diseases of tta lymjloii tissue.
