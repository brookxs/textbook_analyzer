 10.1 Spoken Language Audio Retrieval  Just as a user may wish to search the archives of a large text collection, the ability to search the content of audio sources such as speeches, radio broadcasts, and conversations would be valuable for a range of applications. An assortment of techniques have been developed to support the automated recognition of speech (Waibel and Lee 1990). These have applicability for a range of application areas such as speaker verification, transcription, and command and control. For example, Jones et al. (1997) report a comparative evaluation of speech and text retrieval in the context of the Video Mail Retrieval (VMR) project. While speech transcription word error rates may be high (as much as 50% or more depending upon the source, speaker, dictation vs. conversation, environmental factors and so on), redundancy in the source material helps offset these error rates and still support effective retrieval. In Jones et al.'s speech/text comparative experiments, using standard information retrieval evaluation techniques, speaker-dependent techniques retain approximately 95% of the performance of retrieval of text transcripts, speaker independent techniques about 75%. However, system scalability remains a significant challenge. For example, whereas even the best speech recognition systems have on the order of 100,000 words in an electronic lexicon, text lexicons include upwards of 500,0000 vocabulary words. Another challenge is the need expend significant time and effort to develop an annotated video mail corpus to support machine learning and evaluation.  Some recent efforts have focused on the automated transcription of broadcast news. For example, Figure 10.1 illustrates BBN's Rough 'n 'Ready prototype that aims to provide information access to spoken language from audio and video sources (Kubala et al. 2000). Rough'n'Ready "creates a Rough summarization of speech that is Ready? for browsing."   Figure 10.1 illustrates a Multimedia Information Retrieval  243  January 31, 1998 sample from ABC's World News Tonight in which the left hand column indicates the speaker, the center column shows the translation with highlighted named entities (i.e., people, organizations, locations) and the rightmost column lists the topic of discussion. Rough'n'Ready's transcription is created by the BYBLOSô large vocabulary speech recognition system, a continuous-density Hidden Markov Model (HMM) system that has been competitively tested in annual formal evaluations for the past 12 years (Kubala, F. et al, 1997). BYBLOS runs at 3 times real-time, uses a 60,000 word dictionary, and most recently reported word error rates of 18.8% for the broadcast news transcription task.  ij   £fc    |lt;ft    Vfcw,  Nlp7*aol/RUMarCte*digital libraryhbn  World Sews Tonight 01/31/98  it's a strategy to pressure on council making deals and it's known each day in Southern California latest danger from hell.

Good evening and defense secretary William Cohens said today that a military strike against a rock would be quota substantial in size and impact but Cohen stressed that the strike would not be able to remove Saddam Hussein from power or eliminate his deadly arsenal the defense secretary also had strong words today for the United Nations Security Council ABC's John Mcwethy reports.

Frankly 1 find it... incredibly hard to accept the proposition but in the face oi Saddam's actions and that of members of the Security Council cannot bring themselves to to clear that this is a fundamental or material breach ... of old conduct on his part I think it challenges the credibility of Security Council.  Figure 10.1. BBN's Rough and Ready  Additional research in broadcast news processing is addressing multilingual information access. For example, Gauvain (2000) at LIMSI reports a North American broadcast news transcription system that performs with a 13.6% word error rate and reports spoken document retrieval performance using the SDR'98 TREC-7 data. Current work is investigating broadcast transcription of German and French broadcasts. Joint research between the Tokyo Institute of Technology and NHK broadcasting (Furui et al. 2000) is addressing transcription and topic extraction from Japanese broadcast news. The focus of Furui et al. is on improving processing by modeling filled pauses, performing on-line incremental speaker adaptation and by using a context dependent language model that models readings of words. The language model includes Chinese characters (Kanji) and two kinds of Japanese characters (Hira-gana and Kata-kana).
