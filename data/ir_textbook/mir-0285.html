 14.3.4    Alternatives to Vendor OPACs While early OPACs were developed inhouse, sometimes by enthusiastic amateurs at considerable expenditure of time and money, and a significant risk of failure, ONLINE PUBLIC ACCESS CATALOGS (OPACS)        411 Æ Endeavor Information Systems, Inc. With a significant academic library clientele, Endeavor has replaced a number of NOTIS systems. Its system, Voyager, is based on a multi-tier architecture with Oracle as the DBMS. The public access client and server are Z39.50 compliant. The search engine supports natural language queries and relevance ranking to display results.

Its newest system, Millennium, is based on its INNOPAC library management system but adds a thin client architecture with modules developed in Java. In addition to its own search engine, INNOPAC uses one licensed from Fulcrum Technologies. In Millennium, relevance ranking is available for full-text searching.

Its Q series of library management system tools uses a three-tier, client/server architecture. The search engine is Excalibur Retrieval Ware, on license from Excalibur Technologies. Standard Boolean searching is available but greater functionality is supplied by natural language entry, dictionary-based query expansion, fuzzy search for bad data, and relevance ranked output.

However, there are some instances of systems developed with a research focus for implementation in academic libraries. Notable examples are the Okapi system [416] at City University, London, MARIAN [264] at Virginia Tech, the MELVYL system at the University of California [526], and the Cheshire II system [486] for a UC Berkeley branch library. The Cheshire II system was designed for the UC Berkeley Mathematics, Statistics and Astronomy library using standards such as Z39.50 and SGML. It provides integrated access to bibliographic, full-text and multimedia resources. The search engine offers both probabilistic ranking and Boolean searches, which can be combined in a single search. Cheshire II was designed as a research as well as an operational environment, and issues such as combining probabilistic and 412        LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS Boolean models, and design of the client interface to support searching with a variety of Z39.50 servers while minimizing cognitive overload on searchers [486].
