 2.7.2    Latent Semantic Indexing Model As discussed earlier, summarizing the contents of documents and queries through a set of index terms can lead to poor retrieval performance due to two effects. First, many unrelated documents might be included in the answer set. Second, relevant documents which are not indexed by any of the query keywords are not retrieved. The main reason for these two effects is the inherent vagueness associated with a retrieval process which is based on keyword sets. The ideas in a text are more related to the concepts described in it than to the index terms used in its description. Thus, the process of matching documents to a given query could be based on concept matching instead of index term matching. This would allow the retrieval of documents even when they are not indexed by query index terms. For instance, a document could be retrieved because it shares concepts with another document which is relevant to the given query. Latent semantic indexing is an approach introduced in 1988 which addresses these issues (for clustering-based approaches which also address these issues, see Chapter 5). The main idea in the latent semantic indexing model [287] is to map each document and query vector into a lower dimensional space which is associated with concepts. This is accomplished by mapping the index term vectors into this lower dimensional space. The claim is that retrieval in the reduced space may be superior to retrieval in the space of index terms. Before proceeding, let us define basic terminology. Definition    As before, let t he the number of index terms in the collection and N be the total number of documents. Define M=(Mij) as a term-document association matrix with t rows and N columns.   To each element M^  of this matrix is assigned a weight W{^ associated with the term-document pair {kt.dj\. This u\,j weight could be generated using the tf-idf weighting technique common in the classic vector space model ALTERNATIVE ALGEBRAIC MODELS        45 Latent semantic indexing proposes to decompose the M association matrix in three components using singular value decomposition as follows. M = KSD1 The matrix K is the matrix of eigenvectors derived from the term-to-term correlation matrix given by MM1 (see Chapter 5). The matrix Dl is the matrix of eigenvectors derived from the transpose of the document-to-document matrix given by MlM. The matrix S is an r x r diagonal matrix of singular values where r ó min(t, N) is the rank of M. Consider now that only the s largest singular values of S are kept along with their corresponding columns in K and Dt (i.e., the remaining singular values of 5 are deleted). The resultant Ms matrix is the matrix of rank s which is closest to the original matrix M in the least square sense. This matrix is given by Ms = KsSsDi s where 5, 5 lt; r, is the dimensionality of a reduced concept space. The selection of a value for s attempts to balance two opposing effects. First, s should be large enough to allow fitting all the structure in the real data. Second, s should be small enough to allow filtering out all the non-relevant representational details (which are present in the conventional index-term based representation). The relationship between any two documents in the reduced space of dimensionality 5 can be obtained from the MlMs matrix given by =    (KlS.Dta)tKtSaDta =   DsSsSsDl =    (DsSs)(DsSsy In the above matrix, the (i,j) element quantifies the relationship between documents dx and dj. To rank documents with regard to a given user query, we simply model the query as a pseudo-document in the original M term-document matrix. Assume the query is modeled as the document with number 0. Then, the first row in the matrix MlMs provides the ranks of all documents with respect to this query. Since the matrices used in the latent semantic indexing model are of rank s, s ´t, and s ´ N, they form an efficient indexing scheme for the documents in the collection. Further, they provide for elimination of noise (present in index term-based representations) and removal of redundancy. The latent semantic indexing model introduces an interesting conceptualization of the information retrieval problem based on the theory of singular value decomposition. Thus, it has its value as a new theoretical framework. Whether it is superior in practical situations with general collections remains to be verified. 46 MODELING Query Terms Document Terms Documents Figure 2.7    A neural network model for information retrieval.
