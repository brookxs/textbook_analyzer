 4.7.1 Definition of Hypertext Structure  The Hypertext data structure is used extensively in the Internet environment and requires an electronic media storage for the item. Hypertext allows one item to reference another item via an imbedded pointer. Each separate item is called a node and the reference pointer is called a link. The referenced item can be of the same or a different data type than the original (e.g., a textual item references a photograph). Each node is displayed by a viewer that is defined for the file type associated with the node.  For example, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) defines the internal structure for information exchange across the World Wide Web on the Internet. A document is composed of the text of the item along with HTML tags that describe how to display the document. Tags are formatting or structural keywords contained between less-than, greater than symbols (e.g., lt;titlegt;, lt;stronggt; meaning display prominently). The HTML tag associated with hypertext linkages is lt;a href= ..JNAME /agt; where "a" and "/a" are an anchor start tag and anchor end tag denoting the text that the user can activate, "href is the hypertext reference containing either a file name if the referenced item is on this node or an address (Uniform Resource Locator - URL) and a file name if it is on another node. "#NAME" defines a destination point other than the top of the item to go to. The URL has three components: the access method the client used to retrieve the item, the Internet address of the server where the item is stored, and the address of the item at the server (i.e., the file including the directory it is in). For example, the URL for the HTML specification appears:  http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTML.html  "HTTP" stands for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol which is the access protocol used to retrieve the item in HTML. Other Internet protocols are used for other activities such as file transfer (ftp://), a specific text search system (gopher://), remote logon (tenet://) and collaborative newsgroups (news://). The destination point is found in "info.cern.ch" which is the name of the "info" machine at CERN with uchf being Switzerland, and 47hypertext/WWW/MarkUP/HTML.html" defines where to find the file HTML.html. Figure 4.14 shows an example of a segment of a HTML document. Most of the formatting tags indicated by lt; gt; are not described, being out of the scope of this text, but detailed descriptions can be 96                                                                                                Chapter 4  found in the hundreds of books available on HTML. The lt;a href= ... gt; are the previously described hypertext linkages.  An item can have many hypertext linkages. Thus, from any item there are multiple paths that can be followed in addition to skipping over the linkages to continue sequential reading of the item. This is similar to the decision a reader makes upon reaching a footnote, whether to continue reading or skip to the footnote. Hypertext is sometimes called a "generalized footnote."  In a conventional item the physical and logical structure are closely related. The item is sequential with imbedded citations to other distinct items or  lt;CENTERgt;  lt;IMG SO'Vimages/homeJglo.jpg" WIDTH=468 HEIGHT=107  BORDER=0 ALT="WELCOME TO NETSCAPEgt;lt;BRgt;  lt;digital librarygt;  lt;AHREF=7comprod/mirror/index.htmrgt;  lt;DDgt;  The     beta    testing     is     over:     please     read     our     report     lt;A  HREF="http://www.charm.net/doc/charm/report/theme.html"gt; and your  can                  find                  more                  references                  at  HREF="http://www.charm.net/doc/charm/results/tests.html"gt;  Figure 4.14 Example of Segment of HTML  locations in the item. From the author's perspective, the substantive semantics lie in the sequential presentation of the information. Hypertext is a non-sequential directed graph structure, where each node contains its own information. The author assumes the reader can follow the linked data as easily as following the sequential presentation. A node may have several outgoing links, each of which is then associated with some smaller part of the node called an anchor. When an anchor is activated, the associated link is followed to the destination node, thus navigating the hypertext network. The organizational and reference structure of a conventional item is fixed at printing time while hypertext nodes and links can be changed dynamically. New linkages can be added and the information at a node can change without modification to the item referencing it.  Conventional items are read sequentially by a user. In a hypertext environment, the user "navigates" through the node network by following links. This is the defining capability that allows hypertext to manage loosely structured information. Each thread through different nodes could represent a different concept with additional detail. In a small and familiar network the navigation works well, but in a large information space, it is possible for the user to become disoriented. This issue is discussed in detail in Chapters 5, 7, and 8.  Quite often hypertext references are used to include information that is other than text (e.g., graphics, audio, photograph, video) in a text item.   The Data Structure                                                                                             97  multiple different uses for hypertext references are evolving as more experience is gained with them. When the hypertext is logically part of the item, such as in a graphic, the referenced file is usually resident at the same physical location. When other items created by other users are referenced, they frequently are located at other physical sites. When items are deleted or moved, there is no mechanism to update other items that reference them. Linkage integrity is a major issue in use of hypertext linkages.  Dynamic HTML became available with Navigator 4.0 and Internet Explorer 4.0. It is a collective term for a combination of the latest HTML tags and options, style sheets and programming that will let you create WEB pages that are more animated and responsive to user interaction. Some of the features supported are an object-oriented view of a WEB page and its elements, cascading style sheets, programming that can address most page elements add dynamic fonts. Object oriented views are defined by the Document Object Model - DOM (Micorsoft calls this the Dynamic HTML Object Model while Netscape calls it the HTML Object Model). For example every heading on a page can be named and given attributes of text style and color that can be manipulated by name in a small "program" or script included on the page. A style sheet describes the default style characteristics (page layout, font, text size, etc) of a document or portion of a document. Dynamic HTML allows the specification of style sheets in a cascading fashion (linking style sheets to predefined levels of precedence within the same set of pages. As a result of a user interaction, a new style sheet can be applied changing the appearance of the display. Layering is the use of alternative style sheets to vary the content of a page by providing content layers that overlay and superimpose existing content sections. The existing HTML programming capabilities are being expanded to address the additional data structures. Netscape is also allowing for dynamic fonts to be part of the WEB page thus eliminating the font choice being dependent upon what the browser provides. Since there is no International standard definition of Dynamic HTML, it is being defined in parallel by both Microsoft and Netscape thus precipitating differences in definition and function.
