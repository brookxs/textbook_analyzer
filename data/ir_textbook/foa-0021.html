 1.8 Summary  This chapter has covered enormous ground and attempted to summarize topics that will be discussed in the rest of this text. Major points include:  ï  We constantly and naturally Find Out About (FOA) many, many things. Computer search engines need to support this activity, just as naturally.  ï  Language is central to our FOA activities. Our understanding of prior work in linguistics and the philosophy of language will inform our search engine development, and the increasing use of search engines will provide empirical evidence reflecting back to these same disciplines.  ï  IR is the field of computer science that traditionally deals with retrieving free-text documents in response to queries. This is done by indexing all the documents in a corpus with keyword descriptors. There are a number of techniques for automatically recommending keywords, but it also involves a great deal of art.  ï  Users' interests must be shaped into queries constructed from these same keywords. Retrieval is accomplished by matching the query against the documents' descriptions and returning a list of those that appear closest.  ï  A central component of the FOA process is the users' relevance feedback, assessing how closely the retrieved documents match what they had "in mind."  ï  Search engines accomplish a function related to database systems, but their natural language foundations create fundamental differences as well. OVERVIEW       37  ï In order to know how to shop for a good search engine, as well as to allow the science of FOA to move forward, it is important to develop an evaluation methodology by which we can fairly compare alternatives.  In this overview we've made some simplifying assumptions and raised more questions than we've answered, but that is the goal! By now, I hope you have been convinced that there are many facets to the problem of FOA, ranging from a good characterization of what users seek, to what the documents mean, to methods for inferring semantic clues about each document, to the problem of evaluating whether our search engines are performing as we intend. The rest of this book will consider each of these facets - and others - in greater detail. But like all truly great problems, issues surrounding FOA will remain long after this text is dust.
