 1.1.2    Information Retrieval at the Center of the Stage In the past 20 years, the area of information retrieval has grown well beyond its primary goals of indexing text and searching for useful documents in a collection. Nowadays, research in IR includes modeling, document classification and categorization, systems architecture, user interfaces, data visualization, filtering, languages, etc.   Despite its maturity, until recently, IR was seen as a narrow area of interest mainly to librarians and information experts. Such a tendentious vision prevailed for many years, despite the rapid dissemination, among users of modern personal computers, of IR tools for multimedia and hypertext applications. In the beginning of the 1990s, a single fact changed once and for all these perceptions รณ the introduction of the World Wide Web. The Web is becoming a universal repository of human knowledge and culture which has allowed unprecedent sharing of ideas and information in a scale never seen before. Its success is based on the conception of a standard user interface which is always the same no matter what computational environment is used to run the interface. As a result, the user is shielded from details of communication protocols, machine location, and operating systems. Further, any user can create his own Web documents and make them point to any other Web documents without restrictions. This is a key aspect because it turns the Web into a new publishing medium accessible to everybody. As an immediate BASIC CONCEPTS        3 consequence, any Web user can push his personal agenda with little effort and almost at no cost. This universe without frontiers has attracted tremendous attention from millions of people everywhere since the very beginning. Furthermore, it is causing a revolution in the way people use computers and perform their daily tasks. For instance, home shopping and home banking are becoming very popular and have generated several hundred million dollars in revenues. Despite so much success, the Web has introduced new problems of its own. Finding useful information on the Web is frequently a tedious and difficult task. For instance, to satisfy his information need, the user might navigate the space of Web links (i.e., the hyperspace) searching for information of interest. However, since the hyperspace is vast and almost unknown, such a navigation task is usually inefficient. For naive users, the problem becomes harder, which might entirely frustrate all their efforts. The main obstacle is the absence of a well defined underlying data model for the Web, which implies that information definition and structure is frequently of low quality. These difficulties have attracted renewed interest in IR and its techniques as promising solutions. As a result, almost overnight, IR has gained a place with other technologies at the center of the stage.
