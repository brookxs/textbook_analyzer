 12.5.1    Image Features and Distance Functions We mainly focus on the color features, because color presents an interesting problem (namely, the % cross-talk" of features), which can be resolved by the GEMINI 358        MULTIMEDIA IR: INDEXING AND SEARCHING pixel count orange pink dark blue bright red light blue Figure 12.7    An example of a color histogram of a fictitious sunset photograph: many red, pink, orange, purple, and blue-ish pixels; few yellow, white, and green-ish ones. approach (algorithm 2). For color, we compute a /e-element color histogram for each item and scene, where k = 256 or 64 colors. Each component in the color histogram is the percentage of pixels that are most similar to that color. Figure 12.7 gives an example of such a histogram of a fictitious photograph of a sunset: there are many red, pink, orange, and purple pixels, but only a few white and green ones. Once these histograms are computed, one method to measure the distance between two histograms (A: x 1 vectors) x and y is given by xj - y3) (12.6) where the superscript t indicates matrix transposition, and the color-to-color similarity matrix A has entries ai3 which describe the similarity between color i and color j.
