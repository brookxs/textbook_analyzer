 7.4.2    Basic Concepts There are two general approaches to text compression: statistical and dictionary based. Statistical methods rely on generating good probability estimates (of appearance in the text) for each symbol. The more accurate the estimates are, the better the compression obtained. A symbol here is usually a character, a text word, or a fixed number of characters. The set of all possible symbols in the text is called the alphabet The task of estimating the probability on each next symbol is called modeling. A model is essentially a collection of probability distributions, one for each context in which a symbol can be coded. Once these probabilities are available the symbols are converted into binary digits, a process called coding. In practice, both the encoder and decoder use the same model. The decoder interprets the output of the encoder (with reference to the same model) to find out the original symbol. There are two well known statistical coding strategies: Huffman coding and arithmetic coding. The idea of Huffman coding is to assign a fixed-length bit encoding to each different symbol of the text. Compression is achieved by assigning a smaller number of bits to symbols with higher probabilities of appearance. Huffman coding was first proposed in the early 1950s and was the most important compression method until the late 1970s, when arithmetic coding made higher compression rates possible. Arithmetic coding computes the code incrementally, one symbol at a time, as opposed to the Huffman coding scheme in which each different symbol is pre-encoded using a fixed-length number of bits. The incremental nature does not allow decoding a string which starts in the middle of a compressed file. To decode a symbol in the middle of a file compressed with arithmetic coding, it is necessary to decode the whole text from the very beginning until the desired word is reached. This characteristic makes arithmetic coding inadequate for use in an IR environment. Dictionary methods substitute a sequence of symbols by a pointer to a previous occurrence of that sequence. The pointer representations are references to entries in a dictionary composed of a list of symbols (often called phrases) that are expected to occur frequently.   Pointers to the dictionary entries are 176        TEXT OPERATIONS chosen so that they need less space than the phrase they replace, thus obtaining compression. The distinction between modeling and coding does not exist in dictionary methods and there are no explicit probabilities associated to phrases. The most well known dictionary methods are represented by a family of methods, known as the Ziv-Lempel family. Character-based Huffman methods are typically able to compress English texts to approximately five bits per character (usually, each uncompressed character takes 7-8 bits to be represented). More recently, a word-based Huffman method has been proposed as a better alternative for natural language texts. This method is able to reduce English texts to just over two bits per character. As we will see later on, word-based Huffman coding achieves compression rates close to the entropy and allows random access to intermediate points in the compressed text. Ziv-Lempel methods are able to reduce English texts to fewer than four bits per character. Methods based on arithmetic coding can also compress English texts to just over two bits per character. However, the price paid is slower compression and decompression, and the impossibility of randomly accessing intermediate points in the compressed text. Before proceeding, let us present an important definition which will be useful from now on. Definition Compression ratio is the size of the compressed file as a fraction of the uncompressed file.
