 (Active) Colophon  Production of this book would have been impossible without the use of a number of tools. Many of these were provided by their developers free of charge or as shareware. These include:  #  the emacs editor and related tools from Gnu Project;  ï  the HTjhX and TgK formatting systems, and the OzTex port to  MacQS;  ï  the gimp image manipulation package; and  *  the Linux operating system,  to name only a few.

I therefore propose the following, admittedly unusual, procedure:  After expenses directly related to producing FOAy I hereby commit to passing on 50 percent of all royalties I receive from FOA to organizations who have produced the tools listed above (and others). If you go to the FOA Web site 3and register your copy of the text, you will then be allowed to "vote" on which of these worthy organizations you'd like the money to go to; the Web page will contain full details.  3 http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/-rik/FOA/
