 5.5.1 Probability Ranking Principle  We begin with an important assumption called the Probability Ranking Principle (PRP):t  If a reference retrieval system's response to each request is a ranking of the documents in the collection in order of decreasing probability of relevance... the overall effectiveness of the system to its user will be the best that is obtainable, [van Rijsbergen, p. 113]  This assumption reduces the problem of building an optimal IR system to one of ordering documents in order of decreasing probability of relevance. Defining our retrieval task in these terms is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the amount of expected error in retrieval performance (cf. Section 5.5.6) J  There are at least two possible interpretations of precisely what a probability of relevance, Pr(Rel), means, in terms of an underlying event space [Maron, 1977; Maron, 1982a; Maron and Kuhns, I960], The first is to imagine (again considering a particular query) that the "experiment" of showing the document to a user is repeated across multiple users. Alternatively, we can imagine that the same query/document relevance  ^ MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS   169  question is put repeatedly to the same user, who sometimes replies that it is relevant and sometimes that it isn't. However we interpret Pr(Rel), we will focus on one particular query and compute Pr(Rel) conditionalized by any and all features we might associate with the document d.  Consistent with previous notation (cf. Sections 4.3.4 and 5.3.1), we will define Rank(d) to be a positive integer assigned to each document in the Retrset, in descending order of similarity with respect to a (henceforth implicit) query q, and using the matching function Match(q, d):  Match(q, d) G 5ft Rank(d) G Af+ Rank(di) lt; Rank(dj) 4=4gt; Match(q, df) gt; Match{q, d;-)     (5.33)  According to the PRP, we can hope that our Match(q, d) function accurately reflects the probability of relevance:  Match{qy d) oc Pr(Relq\di)                        (5.34)  (Henceforth, we again restrict our attention to a single query and drop the subscript q.) In fact we only need to require that it reliably ranks documents (again with respect to an implicit query q):  Rank(di) lt; Rank{dj) lt;=^ Pr{Rel\d{) gt; Pr{Rel\dj)         (5.35)  Finally, to emphasize the representation of the document into its constituent features, as well as the sensitivity of our notions of relevance on this representation (cf. [van Rijsbergen, 1992]), the remainder of this section will change notation slightly. Let x be a vector of features x\ describing the document. The PRP is then restated:  Matchiq, d) oc Pr(Rel \ x)                         (536)
