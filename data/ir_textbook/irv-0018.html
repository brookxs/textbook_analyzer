 Normalisation  It is probably useful at this stage to recapitulate and show how a number of levels of normalisation of text is involved in generating document representatives. At the lowest level we have the document which is merely described by a string of words. The first step in normalisation is to remove the 'fluff' words. We now have what traditionally might have been called the 'keywords'. The next stage might be to conflate these words into classes and describe documents by sets of class names which in modern terminology are the keywords or index terms. The next level is the construction of keyword classes by automatic classification. Strictly speaking this is where the normalisation stops.  Index term weighting can also be thought of as a process of normalisation, if the weighting scheme takes into account the number of different index terms per document. For example, we may wish to ensure that a match in one term among ten carries more weight than one among twenty. Similarly, the process of weighting by frequency of occurrence in the total document collection is an attempt to normalise document representatives with respect to expected frequency distributions.
