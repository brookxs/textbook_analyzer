 4.2.5 Conclusions  Frakes summarized studies of various stemming studies (Frakes-92).   He cautions that some of the authors failed to report test statistics, especially sizes, Data Structure                                                                                            81  making interpretation difficult. Also some of the test sample sizes were so small as to make their results questionable. Frakes came to the following conclusions:  Stemming can affect retrieval (recall) and where effects were identified they were positive. There is little difference between retrieval effectiveness of different frill stemmers with the exception of the Hafer and Weiss stemmer.  Stemming is as effective as manual conflation. Stemming is dependent upon the nature of the vocabulary.  To quantify the impact of stemmers, Paice has defined a stemming performance measure called Error Rate Relative to Truncation (ERRT) that can be used to compare stemming algorithms (Paice-94). The approach depends upon the ability to partition terms semantically and morphologically related to each other into "concept groups." After applying a stemmer that is not perfect, concept groups may still contain multiple stems rather than one. This introduces an error reflected in the Understemming Index (UI). Also it is possible that the same stem is found in multiple groups. This error state is reflected in the Overstemming Index (01). The worst case stemming algorithm is where words are stemmed via truncation to a word length (words shorter than the length are not truncated). UI and 01 values can be calculated based upon truncated word lengths. The perfect case is where UI and 01 equal zero. ERRT is then calculated as the distance from the origin to the (UI, 01) coordinate of the stemmer being evaluated (OP) versus the distance from the origin to the worst case intersection of the line generated by pure truncation (OT) (see Figure 4-4).  The values calculated are biased by the initial grouping of the test terms. Larger ERRT values occur with looser grouping. For the particular test runs, the UI of the Porter Algorithm was greater than the UI of the Paice/Husk algorithms (Paice-90). The 01 was largest for the Paice and the least for Porter. Finally, the ERRT of the Porter was greater than the Paice algorithm. These results suggest that the Paice algorithm appeared significantly better than the Porter algorithm. But the differences in objectives between the stemmers (Porter being a light stemmer - tries to avoid overstemming leaving understemming errors and Paice being the opposite, a heavy stemmer) makes comparison less meaningful. While this approach to stemmer evaluation requires additional work to remove imprecisions and provide a common comparison framework, it provides a mechanism to develop a baseline to discuss future developments.  The comparisons by Frakes and Paice support the intuitive feeling that stemming as a generalization of processing tokens for a particular concept (word) can only help in recall. In experiments, stemming has never been proven to significantly improve recall (Harman-91). Stemming can potentially reduce 82                                                                                                Chapter 4  01  Ul  Figure 4.4 Computation of ERRT value  precision. The impact on precision can be minimized by the use of ranking items based upon all the terms in the query, categorization of terms and selective exclusion of some terms from stemming. Unless the user is very restrictive in the query , the impact of the other search terms and those expanded automatically by the system ameliorates the effects of generalization caused by stemming. Stemming in large databases should not be viewed as a significant compression technique to save on storage. Its major advantage is in the significant reduction of dictionary sizes and therefore a possible reduction in the processing time for each search term.
