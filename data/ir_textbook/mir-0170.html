 9.3.1    Introduction Distributed computing is the application of multiple computers connected by a network to solve a single problem. A distributed computing system can be viewed as a MIMD parallel processor with a relatively slow inter-processor communication channel and the freedom to employ a heterogeneous collection of processors in the system. In fact, a single processing node in the distributed system could be a parallel computer in its own right. Moreover, if they all support the same public interface and protocol for invoking their services, the computers in the system may be owned and operated by different parties. Distributed systems typically consist of a set of server processes, each running on a separate processing node, and a designated broker process responsible 250        PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED IR for accepting client requests, distributing the requests to the servers, collecting intermediate results from the servers, and combining the intermediate results into a final result for the client. This computation model is very similar to the MIMD parallel processing model shown in Figure 9.2. The main difference here is that the subtasks run on different computers and the communication between the subtasks is performed using a network protocol such as TCP/IP [176] (rather than, for example, shared memory-based inter-process communication mechanisms). Another significant difference is that in a distributed system it is more common to employ a procedure for selecting a subset of the distributed servers for processing a particular request rather than broadcasting every request to every server in the system. Applications that lend themselves well to a distributed implementation usually involve computation and data that can be split into coarse-grained operations with relatively little communication required between the operations. Parallel information retrieval based on document partitioning fits this profile well. In section 9.2.2 we saw how document partitioning can be used to divide the search task up into multiple, self-contained subtasks that each involve extensive computation and data processing with little communication between them. Moreover, documents are almost always grouped into collections, either for administrative purposes or to combine related documents into a single source. Collections, therefore, provide a natural granularity for distributing data across servers and partitioning the computation. Note that since term partitioning imposes greater communication overhead during query processing, it is rarely employed in a distributed system. To build a distributed IR system, we need to consider both engineering issues common to many distributed systems and algorithmic issues specific to information retrieval. The critical engineering issues involve defining a search protocol for transmitting requests and results; designing a server that can efficiently accept a request, initiate a subprocess or thread to service the request, and exploit any locality inherent in the processing using appropriate caching techniques; and designing a broker that can submit asynchronous search requests to multiple servers in parallel and combine the intermediate results into a final end user response. The algorithmic issues include how to distribute documents across the distributed search servers, how to select which servers should receive a particular search request, and how to combine the results from the different servers. The search protocol specifies the syntax and semantics of messages transmitted between clients and servers, the SÄaquence of messages required to establish a connection and carry out a search operation, and the underlying transport mechanism for sending messages (e.g., TCP/IP). At a minimum, the protocol should allow a client to: obtain information about a search server, e.g., a list of databases available for searching at the server and possibly statistics associated with the databases; DISTRIBUTED IR        251 Æ submit a search request for one or more databases using a well defined query language; Æ receive search results in a well denned format; ï retrieve items identified in the search results. For closed systems consisting of homogeneous search servers, a custom search protocol may be most appropriate, particularly if special functionality (e.g., encryption of requests and results) is required. Alternatively, a standard protocol may be used, allowing the system to interoperate more easily with other search servers. The Z39.50 [606] standard (see Chapter 4) for client/server information retrieval defines a widely used protocol with enough functionality to support most search applications. Another proposed protocol for distributed, heterogeneous search, called STARTS (Stanford Proposal for Internet Meta-Searching) [317], was developed at Stanford University in cooperation with a consortium of search product and service vendors. STARTS was designed from scratch to support distributed information retrieval and includes features intended to solve the algorithmic issues related to distributed IR, such as merging results from heterogeneous sources. The other engineering issues related to building efficient client/server systems have been covered extensively in the literature (see, for example, Comer and Stevens [176] and Zomaya [852]). Rather than review them here, we continue with a more detailed look at the algorithmic issues involved in distributed IR.
