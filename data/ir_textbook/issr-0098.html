 7.2 Similarity Measures and Ranking  Searching in general is concerned with calculating the similarity between a user's search statement and the items in the database. Although many of the older systems are unweighted, the newer classes of Information Retrieval Systems have logically stored weighted values for the indexes to an item. The similarity may be applied to the total item or constrained to logical passages in the item. For example, every paragraph may be defined as a passage or every 100 words. The PIRCS system from Queen's College, CUNY, applies its algorithms to subdocuments defined as 550 word chunks (Kwok-96, Kwok-95). In this case, the similarity will be to the passages versus the total item. Rather limiting the definition of a passage to a fixed length size, locality based similarity allows variable length passages (neighborhoods) based upon similarity of content (Kretser-99). This then leads to the ability to define locality based searching and retrieval of the precise locations of information that satisfies the query. The highest similarity for any of the passages is used as the similarity measure for the item. Restricting the similarity measure to passages gains significant precision with minimal impact on recall. In results presented at TREC-4, it was discovered that passage retrieval makes a significant difference when search statements are long (hundreds of terms) but does not make a major difference for short queries. The lack of a large number of terms makes it harder to find shorter passages that contain the search terms expanded from the shorter queries. 168                                                                                                Chapter 7  Once items are identified as possibly relevant to the user's query, it is best to present the most likely relevant items first. This process is called "ranking." Usually the output of the use of a similarity measure in the search process is a scalar number that represents how similar an item is to the query.
