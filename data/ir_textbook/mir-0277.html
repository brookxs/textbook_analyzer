 14.2.1    Databases The history of commercial online retrieval systems begins with the creation of databases of bibliographic information in electronic form. In fact, Neufeld and Cornog claim 'databases can almost be said to have created the information industry as we now know it' [600]. Abstracting and indexing tools in printed form were available in the nineteenth century and became increasingly available in the twentieth century. Professional organizations, commercial firms, and government bodies served as publishers, selecting relevant materials from the world's literature, creating bibliographic records for them, and providing abstracts and indexing information. These databases were concentrated in the sciences, with titles such as Chemical Abstracts, Biological Abstracts, and Engineering Index, but humanities (Historical Abstracts) and social sciences (PsycINFO) products soon became available. As publishers of abstracts and indexes turned to computer-assisted typesetting and printing for their products, the resulting magnetic tapes of information began to be used for information retrieval purposes. Today virtually all print abstracting and indexing products are also available in electronic form, and many new products are available solely in electronic form, without a print equivalent. As storage costs have dropped dramatically, many of these electronic databases 400        LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS ï  The DIALOG Corporation DIALOG, 'the world's largest online information company,' contains about 500 databases covering a full range of subjects, including science, technology and medicine, humanities, business, and electronic newspapers.

These are referred to as full-text databases, and include databases of journal articles and newspapers as well as reference materials such as encyclopedias and directories. Characteristics of some common databases (as available on DIALOG) are given in Figure 14.3. Databases and Indexing In general, bibliographic databases are expensive to produce, because they require rigorous selection and analysis of the documents that they cover. Some databases cover materials in a specific group of journals, others attempt to be comprehensive, collecting the world's literature within the defined subject scope. Every item must be examined for relevance to the database's goals, indexed, ONLINE IR SYSTEMS AND DOCUMENT DATABASES        401 Æ CA SEARCH: Chemical Abstracts Coverage:   bibliographical records for worldwide literature of chemistry and its applications File size: 14 million records; weekly updates of 11,000 records ï  MEdigital libraryINE Coverage: the broad field of biomedicine, including clinical and experimental medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacology, psychiatry, etc. It indexes articles from 3,700 journals worldwide File size:   about 9.5 million records;  weekly updates of 7700 records ï  New York Times - Fulltext Coverage: full-text of New York Times from 1981 to the present File size: 1.8 million records; daily updates ï  PsycINFO: Psychological Abstracts Coverage: bibliographic records for materials in psychology and related behavioral and social sciences, including psychiatry, sociology, anthropology, education, pharmacology, and linguistics; 1887 to the present File size: 1.5 million records; monthly updates of 5000 records Figure 14.3    Characteristics of some well known databases on DIALOG. abstracted, and entered in the system. Despite the promise of SGML tagging of materials by primary producers, most of this work is still done by the database producer, with a clerical staff to handle data input and subject specialists to abstract (more commonly, edit the author's abstract) and index the material. Each bibliographic database is a unique product designed to meet the information needs of a particular user group. Therefore, there is no single standard for the content of a database record. Typically, it contains tagged information that includes a record key, bibliographic data such as author, title, and source of the document, an abstract, and subject indicators such as indexing terms or category codes. In full-text databases (see Chapters 2 and 4), the text of the document is also included. Sample database records from BIOSIS PREVIEWS (Biological Abstracts) and Historical Abstracts are shown in Figures 14.4 and 14.5. Note that the vocabulary (descriptors and codes) used for subject description is very dependent on the field of study (in this case, biology and history). As these database records show, the subject information they contain is of two types: so-called "natural language' or 4free text1 information found in the title or abstract field, and terms from an indexing or controlled vocabulary which are assigned by human indexers. Most databases include indexing terms in a descriptor field, usually taken from a database-specific thesaurus (e.g., for PsycINFO, the Thesaurus of Psychological Index Terms). Other types of codes or indexing may be applied as relevant to the database (for instance, biosystematic 402        LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS DIALOG(R)File 5:BIOSIS PREVIEWS(R) (c) 1998 BIOSIS.

The assignment of these subject terms contributes significantly to the cost of database production.   Obviously an automated indexing system would be of interest to database producers, though production systems currently in use are best described as performing 'machine-assisted1 rather than automatic indexing. ß With permission of BIOSIS UK.

DOCUMENT TYPE: ARTICLE ABSTRACT: Tells the story of the Union navy's Kearsarge, a sloop-of-war that patrolled English seas looking for Confederate commerce raiders.   Upon docking at the Irish port of Cobh (Queenstown) in November 1863, 16 locals stowed away. They were subsequently returned to Cobh, but in the meantime Captain John Winslow temporarily enlisted the men in order, he said, that they be justifiably clothed and fed, although other ship diaries indicate that the ship was short-handed and Winslow intended a real enlistment. Whatever the reality, the captain inadvertently created an international crisis since his action technically violated the British Foreign Enlistments Act. It is unclear whether Confederates plotted the incident to embarrass the Union in Britain because there are disparities between official accounts and the diaries of individual crewmen.

Prom ABC-CLIO,CA,USA. A subject of early (and ongoing) research has been the relative value of 'free text' and controlled vocabulary terms in contributing to retrieval performance. This subject was addressed in the Cranfield studies in the 1960s [415], and has continued to be examined by researchers up to the present time; good reviews of this research have been presented by Svenonius [752], Lancaster [479], and Rowley [688]. No definitive answer has been found, though later studies seem to suggest a complementarity between the two types of indexing in promoting good retrieval.
