 5.3.2 Natural Language Processing  Section 5.3.1 discussed generation of term phrases as indexes. Lexical analysis determining verb tense, plurality and part of speech is assumed to have been completed prior to the following additional processing. Natural language processing not only produces more accurate term phrases, but can provide higher level semantic information identifying relationships between concepts.  The DR-LINK system (Liddy-93) and Its commercial Implementation via Textwise System adds the functional processes Relationship Concept Detectors, Conceptual Graph Generators and Conceptual Graph Matchers that generate higher level linguistic relationships including semantic and discourse level relationships. This system is representative of natural language based processing systems. During the first phase of this approach, the processing tokens in the document are mapped to Subject Codes as defined by the codes in the Longman's Automatic Indexing                                                                                   129  Dictionary of Common English (LDOCE). Disambiguation uses a priori statistical term relationships and the ordering of the subject codes in the LDOCE, which indicates most likely assignment of a term to a code. These codes equate to index term assignment and have some similarities to the concept-based systems discussed in Section 5.4.  The next phase is called the Text Structurer, which attempts to identify general discourse level areas within an item. Thus a news story may be subdivided into areas associated with EVALUATION (opinions), Main event (basic facts), and Expectations (Predictions). These have been updated to include Analytical Information, Cause/Effect Dimension and Attributed Quotations in the more recent versions of DR-LINK (see http://199.100.962 on the Internet). These areas can then be assigned higher weighting if the user includes "Preference" in a search statement. The system also attempts to determine TOPIC statement identifiers. Natural language processing is not just determining the topic statement(s) but also assigning semantic attributes to the topic such as time frame (past, present, future). To perform this type analysis, a general model of the predicted text is needed. For example, news items likely follow a model proposed by van Dijk (Dijk-88). Liddy reorganized this structure into a News Schema Components consisting of Circumstance, Consequence, Credentials, Definition, Error, Evaluation, Expectation, History, Lead, Main Event, No Comment, Previous Event, References and Verbal reaction. Each sentence is evaluated and assigned weights associated with its possible inclusion in the different components. Thus, if a query is oriented toward a future activity, then, in addition to the subject code vector mapping, it would weight higher terms associated with the Expectation component.  The next level of semantic processing is the assignment of terms to components, classifying the intent of the terms in the text and identifying the topical statements. The next level of natural language processing identifies interrelationships between the concepts. For example, there may be two topics within an item "national elections" and "guerrilla warfare." The relationship "as a result of is critical to link the order of these two concepts. This process clarifies if the elections were caused by the warfare or the warfare caused by the elections. Significant information is lost by not including the connector relationships. These types of linkages are generated by general linguistic cues (words in text) that are fairly general and domain independent.  The final step is to assign final weights to the established relationships. The relationships are typically envisioned as triples with two concepts and a relationship between them. Although all relationships are possible, constructing a system requires the selection of a subset of possible relationships and the rules to locate the relationships. The weights are based upon a combination of statistical information and values assigned to the actual words used in establishing the linkages. Passive verbs would receive less weight than active verbs.  The additional information beyond the indexing is kept in additional data structures associated with each item. This information is used whenever it is implicitly included in a search statement that is natural language based or explicitly requested by the user.
