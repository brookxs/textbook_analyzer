 Matching functions  Many of the more sophisticated search strategies are implemented by means of a matching function. This is a function similar to an association measure, but differing in that a matching function measures the association between a query and a document or cluster profile, whereas an association measure is applied to objects of the same king. Mathematically the two functions have the same properties; they only differ in their interpretations.  There are many examples of matching functions in the literature. Perhaps the simplest is the one associated with the simple matching search strategy.  If M is the matching function, D the set of keywords representing the document, and Q the set representing the query, then:  is another example of a matching function. It is of course the same as Dice's coefficient of Chapter 3.  A popular one used by the SMART project, which they call cosine correlation, assumes that the document and query are represented as numerical vectors in t-space, that is Q = (q1, q2, . . , qt) and D = (d1, d2, . . ., dt) where qi and di are numerical weights associated with the keyword i. The cosine correlation is now simply  or, in the notation for a vector space with a Euclidean norm,  where [[theta]] is the angle between vectors Q and D.
