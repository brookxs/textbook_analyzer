 13.5.3    Helpful Tools There are many software tools to help browsing and searching. Some of them are add-ons to browsers, such as Alexa [10]. Alexa is a free Web navigation service that can be attached as a toolbar at the bottom of any browser and accompanies the user in his surfing. It provides useful information about the sites that are visited, including their popularity, speed of access, freshness, and overall quality (obtained from votes of Alexa users). Alexa also suggests related sites helping one's navigation.   Another navigation service and searching guide is WebTaxi [805]. There are other tools that use visual metaphors, which can be broadly classified into two types: tools designed to visualize a subset of the Web and tools designed to visualize large answers. Both cases need to represent a large graph in a meaningful way. Specific commercial examples of tools to visualize Web subsets are Microsoft's SiteAnalyst (formerly from NetCarta), 3MAPA from Dynamic Diagrams, IBM's Mapuccino (formerly WebCutter [527], shown in Figure 10.22), SurfSerf, Merzscope from Merzcom, CLEARweb, Astra SiteManager, WebAn-alyzer from InContext, HistoryTree from SmartBrowser, etc. Non-commercial works include WebMap [220], Sitemap, Ptolomeaus, and many earlier research [234, 578, 564, 20]. We have not included more generic visualization software, where Web visualization is just a particular case, or other related visualization tools such as Web usage analysis [642, 294, 737]. Metaphors to visualize large answers are covered in Chapter 10. Visual tools are not yet deployed in the whole Web because there is no standard way of communicating visualizers and search engines. One possible approach is to use a markup language based on XML (see Chapter 6), as proposed in [15].
