    Matrix decompositions factored  matrix decomposition  18.3 18.2 We begin by giving two theorems on the decomposition of a square matrix into the product of three matrices of a special form. The first of these, Theorem 18.1.1, gives the basic factorization of a square real-valued matrix into three factors. The second, Theorem 18.1.1, applies to square symmetric matrices and is the basis of the singular value decomposition described in Theorem 18.2. Theorem. (Matrix diagonalization theorem) Let be a square real-valued matrix with linearly independent eigenvectors. Then there exists an eigen decomposition (223)       (224)  End theorem. To understand how Theorem 18.1.1 works, we note that has the eigenvectors of as columns (225)   (226)   (227)   (228)     We next state a closely related decomposition of a symmetric square matrix into the product of matrices derived from its eigenvectors. This will pave the way for the development of our main tool for text analysis, the singular value decomposition (Section 18.2 ). Theorem. (Symmetric diagonalization theorem) Let be a square, symmetric real-valued matrix with linearly independent eigenvectors. Then there exists a symmetric diagonal decomposition (229)        End theorem. We will build on this symmetric diagonal decomposition to build low-rank approximations to term-document matrices. Exercises. What is the rank of the diagonal matrix below? (230) Show that is an eigenvalue of (231) Find the corresponding eigenvector.
