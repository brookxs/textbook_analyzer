 13.7.3    Teaching the User Interfaces are slowly improving in assisting the user with the task of acquiring a better grasp of what Web pages are being retrieved. Query forms must specify clearly if one or all the words must be in a page, which words should not be in a page, etc., without using a written Boolean query language. Second, users should try to give as many terms as possible, in particular terms that must be or should not be in the pages. In particular, a user should include all possible synonyms of a word. If the user can restrict the search to a field (for example, the page title) or limit some attribute (date, country), this will certainly reduce the size of the answer. In case of doubt, the user should remember to look at the help information provided by the search engine. If he cannot find where one of the relevant terms is in a page, he can use the Find option of the browser. Even if we are able to pose a good query, the answer can still be quite large. Considering that the visual tools mentioned before are not yet available for the general public, the user must learn from experience. There are many strategies for quickly finding relevant answers. If the user is looking for an institution, he can always try to guess the corresponding URL by using the www prefix followed by a guessed institution acronym or brief name and ending with a top level domain (country code or com, edu, org, gov for the US). If this does not work, the user can search the institution name in a Web directory. If we are looking for work related to a specific topic, a possible strategy is: (1) select an article relevant to the topic, if possible with non-common author surnames or title keywords (if it is not available, try any bibliographic database or a Web directory search for a first reference); and (2) use a search engine to find all Web pages that have all those surnames and keywords. Many of the results are likely to be relevant, because we can find: (a) newer papers that reference the initial reference, (b) personal Web pages of the authors, and most important, (c) pages about the topic that already contain many relevant references. This strategy can be iterated by changing the reference used as better references appear during the search. As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, the Web poses so many problems, that it is easier and more effective to teach the user how to properly profit from search engines and Web directories, rather than trying to guess what the user really wants. Given that the coverage of the search engines is low, use several engines or a metasearcher. Also, remember that you have to evaluate the quality of each answer, even if it appears to be relevant. Remember that anybody can publish in the Web, and that does not mean that the data is correct or still valid. The lessons learned in the examples shown above are: (1) search engines still return too much hay together with the needle: and (2) Web directories do not have enough depth to find the needle. So, we can use the following rules of thumb: 392        SEARCHING THE WEB Æ Specific queries Look in an encyclopedia, that is the reason that they exist. In other words, do not forget libraries. Æ Broad queries Use Web directories to find good starting points. ï Vague queries Use Web search engines and improve the query formulation based on relevant answers.
