 Averaging techniques  The method of pooling or averaging of the individual P-R curves seems to have depended largely on the retrieval strategy employed. When retrieval is done by co-ordination level, micro-evaluation is adopted. If S is the set of requests then:  where As is the set of documents relevant to request s. If [[lambda]] is the co-ordination level, then:  where B[[lambda]]s is the set of documents retrieved at or above the co-ordination level [[lambda]]. The points (R[[lambda]] , P[[lambda]] ) are now calculated as follows:  Figure 7.2 shows graphically what happens when two individual P-R curves are combined in this way. The raw data are given in Table 7.1.  An alternative approach to averaging is macro-evaluation which can be independent of any parameter such as co-ordination level. The average curve is obtained by specifying a set of standard recall values for which average precision values are calculated by averaging over all queries the individual precision values corresponding to the standard recall values. Often no unique precision value corresponds exactly so it becomes necessary to interpolate.  Table 7.1. THE RAW DATA FOR THE MICRO-EVALUATION IN FIGURE 7.2
