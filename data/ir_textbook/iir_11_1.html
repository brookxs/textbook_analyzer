    Review of basic probability theory We hope that the reader has seen a little basic probability theory previously. We will give a very quick review; some references for further reading appear at the end of the chapter. A variable represents an event (a subset of the space of possible outcomes). Equivalently, we can represent the subset via a random variable , which is a function from outcomes to real numbers; the subset is the domain over which the random variable has a particular value. Often we will not know with certainty whether an event is true in the world. We can ask the probability of the event . For two events and , the joint event of both events occurring is described by the joint probability . The conditional probability expresses the probability of event given that event occurred. The fundamental relationship between joint and conditional probabilities is given by the chain rule : (56)  Writing for the complement of an event, we similarly have: (57)   partition rule    (58)  From these we can derive Bayes' Rule for inverting conditional probabilities: (59)    prior probability   posterior probability    likelihood    Finally, it is often useful to talk about the odds of an event, which provide a kind of multiplier for how probabilities change: (60)
