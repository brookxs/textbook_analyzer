 14.2.2    Online Retrieval Systems The use of the computer for bibliographic information retrieval was first demonstrated in the 1950s, and initiated by the National Library of Medicine in 1964 using batch processing [107]. Also in the 1960s, federally funded projects were carried out to develop prototype online systems which were then implemented in government research laboratories.   The first production service, Lockheed's 404        LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS DIALOG system, was implemented for NASA and subsequently made available to other government locations before becoming a commercial activity in the early 1970s and undergoing several changes in ownership. Today DIALOG operates worldwide with databases offered via the Internet to libraries and other organizations as well as individuals. With a few exceptions, database vendors do not produce information but rather make it available to searchers via a common search interface. Database vendors license databases from the producers, process the databases to introduce as much standardization as is feasible (e.g., standard field names), mount the database through the creation of inverted indexes, create database descriptions and aids to searchers in a standard format, and conduct training sessions for clients (see Figure 14.1). These organizations offer a value-added service by providing a common gateway to multiple databases. A database vendor may offer cross-database searches; for example, DIALOG allows the searcher to search simultaneously a predetermined or searcher-selected grouping of databases to create a merged set of references, then process the set to remove duplicates.
