 11.3.1    Request Specification Two different interfaces can be presented to the user for querying multimedia objects. The first type of interface is based on browsing and navigation. Usually, due to the complex structure of multimedia objects, it may be useful to let users browse and navigate inside the structure of multimedia objects to locate the desired objects. Such an approach is typically used in CAD/CAM/CASE environments due to the complex structure of the objects under consideration. Navigation, however, is not always the best way to find multimedia objects, in that it may be heavily time consuming when the object desired is deeply nested. The second approach for selecting objects is therefore based, as traditionally in DBMSs, on specifying the conditions the objects of interest must satisfy, by means of queries. Queries, in turn, can be specified in two different ways: the first, typical of a traditional database context, is to enter the query by using a specific query language. However, in some cases (especially when images and audio data are considered), a query by example approach is preferred. Under this approach, queries are specified by using actual data inside a visual environment; the user provides the system with an object example that is then used to retrieve all the stored objects similar to the given one. For example, the user may choose a house and pose the query: 'Retrieve all houses of similar shape and different color.' This approach requires the use of a GUI environment where the user can pick examples and compose the query object. In order to pick examples, the system must supply some domains, i.e., sets of typical values, one for each object feature (see section 11.2).
