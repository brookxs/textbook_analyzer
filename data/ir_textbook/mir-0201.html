 10.6.3    Query Term Hits Between Documents Other visualization ideas have been developed to show a different kind of information about the relationship between query terms and retrieved documents. Rather than showing how query terms appear within individual documents, as is done in KWIC interfaces and TileBars, these systems display an overview or summary of the retrieved documents according to which subset of query terms they contain. The following subsections describe variations on this idea. 294        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION Figure 10.17     A sketch of the InfoCrystai retrieval results display [738]. InfoCrystal The InfoCrystai shows how many documents contain each subset of query terms [738]. This relieves the user from the need to specify Boolean ANDs and ORs in their query, while still showing which combinations of terms actually appear in documents that were ordered by a statistical ranking (although beyond four terms the interface becomes difficult to understand). The InfoCrystai allows visualization of all possible relations among N user-specified 'concepts' (or Boolean keywords). The InfoCrystai displays, in a clever extension of the Venn diagram paradigm, the number of documents retrieved that have each possible subset of the N concepts. Figure 10.17 shows a sketch of what the InfoCrystai might display as the result of a query against four keywords or Boolean phrases, labeled A, B, C. and D. The diamond in the center indicates that one document was discovered that contains all four keywords. The triangle marked with *12" indicates that 12 documents were found containing attributes A, B, and D, and so on. The InfoCrystai does not show proximity among the terms within the documents, nor their relative frequency. So a document that contains dozens of hits on 'volcano' and 'lava' and one hit on 'Mars' will be grouped with documents that contain mainly hits on 'Mars' but just one mention each of 'volcano* and iava." authoring CONTEXT        295 navigation l hypertext-engineering knowledge representation usabili1y-links-and-fbtion                             .   _        u               ._....._.                  __^ ^                        '  ^^                    ïï^"'¶'     ^                 ó------fmplernentationsand-in1er1aces application Figure 10.18     An example of the VIBE retrieval results display [452]. VIBE and Lyberworld Graphical presentations that operate on similar principles are VIBE [452] and Lyberworld [363]. In these displays, query terms are placed in an abstract graphical space. After the search, icons are created that indicate how many documents contain each subset of query terms. The subset status of each group of documents is indicated by the placement of the icon. For example, in VIBE a set of documents that contain three out of five query terms are shown on an axis connecting these three terms, at a point midway between the representations of the three query terms in question. (See Figure 10.18.) Lyberworld presents a 3D version of this idea. Lattices Several researchers have employed a graphical depiction of a mathematical lattice for the purposes of query formulation, where the query consists of a set of constraints on a hierarchy of categories (actually, semantic attributes in these systems) [631, 147]. This is one solution to the problem of displaying documents in terms of multiple attributes; a document containing terms A, B, C, and D could be placed at a point in the lattice with these four categories as parents. However, if such a representation were to be applied to retrieval results instead of query formulation, the lattice layout would in most cases be too complex to allow for readability. None of the displays discussed in this subsection have been evaluated for effectiveness at improving query specification or understanding of retrieval results, but they are intriguing ideas and perhaps are useful in conjunct ion with other displays. 296        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION  ¶3m ___ d Figure 10.19     The SuperBook interface for showing retrieval results on a large manual in context [481]. 10.6.4    SuperBook: Context via Table of Contents The SuperBook system [481, 229, 230] makes use of the structure of a large document to display query term hits in context. The table of contents (TOC) for a book or manual are shown in a hierarchy on the left-hand side of the display, and full text of a page or section is shown on the right-hand side. The user can manipulate the table of contents to expand or contract the view of sections and subsections. A focus-plus-context mechanism is used to expand the viewing area of the sections currently being looked at and compress the remaining sections. When the user moves the cursor to another part of the TOC, the display changes dynamically, making the new focus larger and shrinking down the previously observed sections. After the user specifies a query on the book, the search results are shown in the context of the table of contents hierarchy. (See Figure 10.19.) Those sections that contain search hits are made larger and the others are compressed. The query terms that appear in chapter or section names are highlighted in reverse video. When the user selects a page from the table of contents view, the page itself is displayed on the right-hand side and the query terms within the page are highlighted in reverse video. The SuperBook designers created innovative techniques for evaluating its special features. Subjects were compared using this system against using paper (Iocunieiitatiori and against a more standard online infoririatiori access system. Subjects were also compared on different kinds of carefully selected tasks: browsing topics of interest, citation searching, searching to answer questions, and searching and browsing to write summary essays.   For most of the tasks CONTEXT        297 SuperBook subjects were faster and more accurate or equivalent in speed and accuracy to a standard system. When differences arose between SuperBook and the standard system, the investigators examined the logs carefully and hypothesized plausible explanations. After the initial studies, they modified SuperBook according to these hypotheses and usually saw improvements as a result [481]. The user studies on the improved system showed that users were faster and more accurate at answering questions in which some of the relevant terms were within the section titles themselves, but they were also faster and more accurate at answering questions in which the query terms fell within the full text of the document only, as compared both to a paper manual and to an interface that did not provide such contextualizing information. SuperBook was not faster than paper when the query terms did not appear in the document text or the table of contents. This and other evidence from the SuperBook studies suggests that query term highlighting is at least partially responsible for improvements seen in the system.
