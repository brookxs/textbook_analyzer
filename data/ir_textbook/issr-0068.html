This chapter focuses on the process and algorithms to perform indexing. The indexing process is a transformation of an item that extracts the semantics of the topics discussed in the item. The extracted information is used to create the processing tokens and the searchable data structure. The semantics of the item not only refers to the subjects discussed in the item but also in weighted systems, the depth to which the subject is discussed. The index can be based on the full text of the item, automatic or manual generation of a subset of terms/phrases to represent the item, natural language representation of the item or abstraction to concepts in the item. The results of this process are stored in one of the data structures (typically inverted data structure) described in Chapter 4. Distinctions, where appropriate, are made between what is logically kept in an index versus what is physically stored.  This text includes chapters on Automatic Indexing and User Search techniques. There is a major dependency between the search techniques to be implemented and the indexing process that stores the information required to execute the search. This text categorizes the indexing techniques into statistical, natural language, concept, and hypertext linkages. Insight into the rationale for this classification is presented in Section 5.1.
