 4.7.3 XML  The extensible Markup Language (XML) is starting to become a standard data structure on the WEB. Its first recommendation (1.0) was issued on February 10, 1998. It is a middle ground between the simplicities but lack of flexibility of HTML and the complexity but richness of SGML (ISO 8879). Its objective is extending HTML with semantic information. The logical data structure within XML is defined by a Data Type Description (DTD) and is not constrained to the 70 defined tags and 50 attributes in the single DTD for HTML. The user can create any tags needed to describe and manipulate their structure. The W3C (Worldwide Web Consortium) is redeveloping HTML as a suite of XML tags. The following is a simple example of XML tagging:  lt;companygt;Widgets Inc.lt;/companygt; lt;citygt;Bostonlt;/citygt;  lt;stategt;Masslt;/stategt; lt;prodoctgt;widgetslt;/productgt;  The W3C is also developing a Resource Description Format (RDF) for representing properties of WEB resources such as images, documents and relationships between them. This will include the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) for attaching labels to material for filtering (e.g., unsuitable for children). Data Structure                                                                                            99  Hypertext links for XML are being defined in the Xlink (XML Linking Language) and Xpoint (XML Pointer language) specifications. This will allow for distinction for different types of links to locations within a document and external to the document. This will allow an application to know if a link is just a repositioning reference within an item or link to another document that is an extension of the existing document. This will help in determining what needs to be retrieved to define the total item to be indexed.  Finally XML will include an XML Style Sheet Linking definition to define how to display items on a particular style sheet and handle cascading style sheets. This will allow designers to limit what is displayed to the user (saving on display screen space) and allow expansion to the whole item if desired.
