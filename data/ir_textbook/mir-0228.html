 11.3.3    Uncertainty, Proximity, and Weights in Query Expressions As we have already remarked, the execution of a content-dependent query returns a set of relevant objects. An interesting aspect in designing a multimedia query language is how it is possible to specify the degree of relevance of the retrieved objects. In general, this can be done in three different ways: ï  By using some imprecise terms and predicates, such as normal, unacceptable, typical. Each of those terms does not represent a precise value but a set of possible acceptable values with respect to which the attribute or the feature has to be matched. ï  By specifying particular proximity predicates.  In this case, the predicate does not represent a precise relationship between objects or between attributes/features and values. Rather, the relationship represented is based on the computation of a semantic distance between the query object and the stored ones, on the basis of the extracted features. The Nearest object search is an example of proximity predicate, by which the user requests all the objects which are closest or within a certain distance of a given object. Indexing support for this kind of query is discussed in Chapter 12. ï  By assigning each condition or term a given weighty specifying the degree of precision by which a condition must be verified by an object. For example, the query 'Find all the objects containing an image representing a screen (HIGH) and a keyboard (LOW)' [657], can be used to retrieve all the objects containing an image representing a screen and a keyboard. However, the objects containing only a screen are also retrieved and returned to the user, after the ones containing both the screen and the keyboard, since the condition imposing the containment of a keyboard is weaker than the condition imposing the containment of a screen. The use of imprecise terms and relationships, as well as the use of weights, allows the user to drive the similarity-based selection of relevant objects. The corresponding query is executed by assigning some importance and preference values to each predicate and term. Then* objects are retrieved and presented to the user as an ordered list. This ordering is given by a score associated with each object, giving a measure of the matching degree between the object and 338        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES the query. The computation of the score is based on probabilistic models, using the preference values assigned to each predicate.
