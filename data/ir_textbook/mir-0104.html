 6.3.4    Similarity Models In this section we define notions of syntactic similarity between strings or documents. Similarity is measured by a distance function. For example, if we have strings of the same length, we can define the distance between them as the number of positions that have different characters. Then, the distance is 0 if they are equal. This is called the Hamming distance. A distance function should also be symmetric (that is, the order of the arguments does not matter) and should satisfy the triangle inequality (that is, distance(a, c) lt; distance(a, b) 4- distance(b, c)). An important distance over strings is the edit or Levenshtein distance mentioned earlier. The edit distance is defined as the minimum number of characters, insertions, deletions, and substitutions that we need to perform in any of the strings to make them equal. For instance, the edit distance between 'color1 and 'colour1 is one, while the edit distance between 'survey1 arid 'surgery' is two. The edit distance is considered to be superior for modeling syntactic errors than other more complex methods such as the Soundex system, which is based on phonetics [595]. Extensions to the concept of edit distance include different weights for each operation, adding transpositions, etc. There are other measures. For example, assume that we are comparing two given strings and the only operation allowed is deletion of characters. Then, after all non-common characters have been deleted, the remaining sequence of characters (not necessarily contiguous in the original string, but in the same order) is the longest common subsequence (LCS) of both strings. For example, the LCS of 'survey' and "surgery' is %surey.' MARKUP LANGUAGES        149 Similarity can be extended to documents. For example, we can consider lines as single symbols and compute the longest common sequence of lines between two files. This is the measure used by the dif f command in Unix-like operating systems. The main problem with this approach is that it is very time consuming and does not consider lines that are similar. The latter drawback can be fixed by taking a weighted edit distance between lines or by computing the LCS over all the characters. Other solutions include extracting fingerprints (any piece of text that in some sense characterizes it) for the documents and comparing them, or finding large repeated pieces. There are also visual tools to see document similarity. For example, Dotplot draws a rectangular map where both coordinates are file lines and the entry for each coordinate is a gray pixel that depends on the edit distance between the associated lines.
