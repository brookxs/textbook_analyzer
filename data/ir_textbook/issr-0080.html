 53 Natural Language  The goal of natural language processing is to use the semantic information in addition to the statistical information to enhance the indexing of the item. This improves the precision of searches, reducing the number of false hits a user reviews. The semantic information is extracted as a result of processing the 124  Chapter 5  language rather than treating each word as an independent entity. The simplest output of this process results in generation of phrases that become indexes to an item. More complex analysis generates thematic representation of events rather  Figure 5.7 Extended Bayesian Network  than phrases. Statistical approaches use proximity as the basis behind determining the strength of word relationships in generating phrases. For example, with a proximity constraint of adjacency,    the phrases 'Venetian blind" and "blind  Venetian" may appear related and map to the same phrase.  But syntactically and  semantically those phrases are very different concepts. Word phrases generated by natural language processing algorithms enhance indexing specification and provide another level of disambiguation. Natural language processing can also combine the concepts into higher level concepts sometimes referred to as thematic representations. One example represents them as concept-relationship-concept triples   (Liddy-93).
