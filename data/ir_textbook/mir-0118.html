 7.2    Document Preprocessing Document preprocessing is a procedure which can be divided mainly into five text operations (or transformations): (1)  Lexical analysis of the text with the objective of treating digits, hyphens, punctuation marks, and the case of letters. (2)  Elimination of stopwords with the objective of filtering out words with very low discrimination values for retrieval purposes. (3)  Stemming of the remaining words with the objective of removing affixes (i.e., prefixes and suffixes) and allowing the retrieval of documents containing syntactic variations of query terms (e.g., connect, connecting, connected, etc). (4)  Selection of index terms to determine which words/stems (or groups of words) will be used as an indexing elements.    Usually, the decision on whether a particular word will be used as an index term is related to the syntactic nature of the word.   In fact, noun words frequently carry more semantics than adjectives, adverbs, and verbs. (5)  Construction of term categorization structures such as a thesaurus, or extraction of structure directly represented in the text, for allowing the expansion of the original query with related terms (a usually useful procedure). In the following, each of these phases is discussed in detail. But, before proceeding, let us take a look at the logical view of the documents which results after each of the above phases is completed. Figure 1.2 is repeated here for convenience as Figure 7.1. As already discussed, by aggregating the preprocessing phases, we are able to move the logical view of the documents (adopted by the system) from that of a full text to that of a set of high level indexing terms.
