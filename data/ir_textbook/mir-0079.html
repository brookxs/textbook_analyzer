 4.5    Query Protocols In this section we briefly cover some query languages that are used automatically by software applications to query text databases. Some of them are proposed as standards for querying CD-ROMs or as intermediate languages to query library systems. Because they are not intended for human use, we refer to them as protocols rather than languages. More information on protocols can be found in Chapters 14 and 15. The most important query protocols are: ï  Z39.50 is a protocol approved as a standard in 1995 by ANSI and NISO. This protocol is intended to query bibliographical information using a standard interface between the client and the host database manager which is independent of the client user interface and of the query database language at the host. The database is assumed to be a text collection with some fixed fields (although it is more flexible than usual). The Z39.50 protocol is used broadly and is part, for instance, of WAIS (see below). The protocol does not only specify the query language and its semantics, but also the way in which client and server establish a session, communicate and exchange information, etc.   Although originally conceived only to operate on bibliographical information (using the Machine Readable Cataloging Record (MARC) format), it has been extended to query other types of information as well. ï  WAIS   (Wide Area Information Service) is a suite of protocols that was popular at the beginning of the 1990s before the boom of the Web.  The goal of WAIS was to be a network publishing protocol and to be able to query databases through the Internet. In the CD-ROM publishing arena, there are several proposals for query protocols. The main goal of these protocols is to provide 'disk interchangeability." This means more flexibility in data communication between primary information providers and end users. It also enables significant cost savings since it allows access to diverse information without the need to buy, install, and train users for different data retrieval applications. We briefly cover three of these proposals: 114        QUERY LANGUAGES Æ CCL (Common Command Language) is a NISO proposal (Z39.58 or ISO 8777) based on Z39.50. It defines 19 commands that can be used interactively. It is more popular in Europe, although very few products use it. It is based on the classical Boolean model. ï  CD-RDx   (Compact Disk Read only Data exchange) uses a client-server architecture and has been implemented in most platforms.   The client is generic while the server is designed and provided by the CD-ROM publisher who includes it with the database in the CD-ROM. It allows fixed-length fields, images, and audio, and is supported by such US national agencies as the CIA, NASA, and GSA. ï  SFQL   (Structured Full-text Query Language) is based on SQL and also has a client-server architecture. SFQL has been adopted as a standard by the aerospace community (the Air Transport Association/Aircraft Industry Association). Documents are rows in a relational table and can be tagged using SGML. The language defines the format of the answer, which has a header and a variable length message area. The language does not define any specific formatting or markup. For example, a query in SFQL is: Select abstract from journal.papers where title contains  "text search" The language supports Boolean and logical operators, thesaurus, proximity operations, and some special characters such as wild cards and repetition. For example: where paper contains  "retrieval"  or like  "info ï/," and date gt; 1/1/98 Compared with CCL or CD-RDx, SFQL is more general and flexible, although it is based on a relational model, which is not always the best choice for a document database.
