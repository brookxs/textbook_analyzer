 5.2.6 Computational Considerations  All these techniques depend, of course, on being able to compute the SVD for the Index relation. Given the enormous size of this matrix รณ typically 104 keywords times 105 to 109 documents - this is a nontrivial concern. However, the fact that these matrices are sparse (i.e., any one document vector has a relatively small fraction of keywords associated with it) means that special techniques can be used. In particular, Berry has developed methods based on Lanczos and subspace iteration methods in his SVDPack1 implementation [Berry, 1992; Berry et al., 1994; Letsche, 1996].+  Once the document corpus has finally been compressed, another serious recurring computation must be done: Every time a user issues a query, it must be transformed from the original space of "raw" keywords into the reduced /c-dimensional space. This means we must keep the matrix Uk available to transform each query into the reduced representation.  Another computational issue has to do with the effect of new documents being added to the collection, or older ones being removed. This is one particular type* of drift we might expect in FOA; Section 7.3.2 discusses several others. The addition or deletion of any one document will affect the SVD statistics of the entire corpus very slightly, especially if it is a very large corpus.  SVD is patentable?!  Temporal drift
