 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS       299  8.2.1 The FOA Language Game  Lurking at the core of the entire FOA enterprise is the fundamental question of semaBtics: What do the words in our language mean? Computer scientists are most familiar with artificial languages (formal grammars, programming languages, etc.) for which precise semantics in terms of a particular machine are absolutely necessary. Many philosophers of language, notably Frege and Ludwig Wittgenstein, have advocated that a similarly precise semantics of natural language is also possible. Words are predicates about states of the world: Either they apply or they don't  An alternative point of view says that such a precise and abstract semantics can never be achieved. What language means is what it means to us, the language users. That is, words' meaning cannot be separated from the forms of life of which they are a part. As it happens the same Ludwig Wittgenstein has argued forcefully on this side of the debate too!^  One of Wittgenstein's most useful devices for getting across his theory of language was his notion of the language game (Sprachspiele in German) [Wittgenstein, 1953]. Wittgenstein gives many varieties of language games, from chidren's games as simple as "ring-around-the-rosy" [Wittgenstein, 1953, Section 7] to such "adult" games as:  ï  forming and testing hypotheses;  ï  making up a story and reading it; and  ï  asking questions.  It is interesting to compare the multiplicity of the tools in language and of the ways they are used [Wittgenstein, 1953, Section 23]. Certainly FOA counts as another example of a language game, but one with special  rules.  Another interesting aspect of Wittgenstein's theory is how well it anticipates the models of language meaning arising from modern machine learning techniques. The common cause is that Wittgenstein was  centrally concerned with learning by children. This is evident in his aringaround-the-rosy" example, and in his explicit attention to consequences  of learning that apply equally well to our algorithms:  [Consider] two pictures, one of which consists of colour patches with vague contours, and the other of patches... with clear contours. The degree to which the sharp picture can resemble  Early versus  late  Wittgenstein 300       FINDING OUT ABOUT  the blurred one depends on the latter's degree of vagueness___Won't you then have to say: "Anything and nothing  is right." And this is the position you are in if you look for the definition corresponding to our concepts in aesthetics or ethics.  In such a difficulty always ask yourself: How did we learn the meaning of this word [vague] ? From what sort of examples? In what language games? Then it will be easier for you to see that the word must have a family of meanings. [Wittgenstein 1953, Sections 76, 77]  Our current versions of the FOA language games are tied to the technologies by which we are currently allowed to communicate with one another. For now, centralized search engines are in the center of this dialog. Authors write and sometimes try to influence the audiences their documents reach. Later, readers use a few of the first words that come to mind to tease out some possible answers. Search engines do their best to connect these two vocabularies.  Reading and writing are the primitive language games on which FOA is based. The tools available to help writers and readers are currently strong constraints in the FOA rules. People can only express what they are allowed to express. If only simple query languages are available, only simple questions will be asked. If all documents are treated interchangeably, as context-free samples of text, then the tacit context assumed by the author is not available.  And so, our abilities to automatically learn what the words really do mean to authors and to readers will change as the evidence in the WWW dialogs changes. Especially unclear are guarantees about communication privacy and security: If we believe all our words are for everyone's ears, then many things will never be said via the Net. If search engines watch over our shoulders as we browse, should we be grateful because it will understand what we mean, or should we send them a bill for the valuable training data we have provided? As companies like Amazon.com8 use new technologies that allow them to "eavesdrop" on commercial transactions^ consumers must ultimately decide what their privacy and more effective indexing are worth to them personally.  1 Ajnazon.com  * newB.cnet.oom/news/0-1007-200-1S17791 .html CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS       301  Passion FIGURE 8.2 The Semiotic View  Semiotics  The next step toward a theory of what the FOA language game might mean involves semiotics, the subfield of linguistics centrally concerned with the ability of signs to convey meaning. Dating back at least to the American pragmatist philosopher C. S. Peirce and the French linguist Saussure, semiotics is now often associated with Umberto Eco (most famous for his popular novel Name of the Rose [Eco, 1983]). David Blair has written an excellent overview of the field [Blair, 1990, chapter 4].  In order to get away from using words as communicative signs, semioticists often use other symbols, such as the ROSE shown in Figure 8.2 In brief, semiotic theory imagines meaning being trapped by the triad of signifier, signified, and sign. Hawkes (quoted from Blair) uses a gift of ROSES as an example of how meaning can be conveyed:  ... a BUNCH OF ROSES can be used to signify passion. When  it does so, the BUNCH OF ROSES is the signifier, the passion  the signified. The relation between the two (the associative total) produces the third term, the BUNCH OF ROSES as a sign. And, as a sign it is important to understand that the BUNCH OF ROSES is quite a different thing from the BUNCH OF ROSES as a signifier, that is, as a horticultural entity. As a signifies the BUNCH OF ROSES is empty, as a sign it is full. What has filled it (with signification) is a combination of my intent and the nature of society's conventional modes and channels which offer me a range of vehicles for the purpose. The range is extensive, 302       FINDING OUT ABOUT  I'm looking for  documents  ABOUT  "Message passing interface"  "MPI"  "MPI"  "Multi-perspective interactive (video)"  FIGURE 8.3 A Semiotic Analysis of Keyword Mismatch  but conventionalized and so finite, and it offers a complex system of ways, of signing. [Hawkes, 1977, p. 131, quoted from Blair, 1990, monospace font not in original]  That is, in a successful communicative act, the sign of ROSES successfully unites what the signifier was trying to express with what the receiving listener thinks they are pointing at, i.e., the content of the sign.  Figure 8.3 applies this analysis to the case when a mediating search engine stands between linguistic sign users. When a keyword like MPI is used as part of a query by a user intent on the features of the MESSAGE PASSING INTERFACE (a communication standard used by parallel computers and language compilers), it is confounded with documents authored by people who use MPI to mean MULTI-PERSPECTIVE INTERACTIVE (video). The same signifier MPI points to two different significations. If a specialist in PARALLEL COMPUTING has MULTIMEDIA VIDEO documents returned by the search engine, the communication of a unifying sign has not been accomplished.

Reproduced with permission of Academic Press  like libraries, contains written language, which communicates between readers and writers separated by arbitrary amounts of time and space. Differences between orality and literacy are some of the most important to understand if FOA is to become a part of traditional linguistics [Ong, 1982].  An important dimension of the difference between oral and literate communication concerns the attentional focus of sender and receiver and how and when it is given. Before any symbols can be exchanged, the sender must apply attention to the construction of a message, and before a receiver can understand it he or she must be "listening." Communication is a demand for attention by the author and of a reader.  Grice has defined what he calls the cooperative principle to make explicit the co-dependence of sender and receiver's communicative tasks [Grice, 1957; Grice, 1975]. Grice's maxims (see Figure 8.4) help to codify ways in which this tacit contract can lead to meaningful communication or be broken."^" Although these were drafted with oral communica-    Star Trek script tion in mind, they remain (with Strunk and White's Elements of Style    generator [Strunk and White, 1979]) excellent advice to authors on how to write clearly.  A second important difference between oral and written communication is its intimacy. Spoken language is imagined to be a quiet act, between a particular speaker and a listener. The FOA communicative acts with which we are most concerned involve much more public displays of language. In 1975, Saracevic [Saracevic, 1975] talked about this as 304       FINDING OUT ABOUT  communicating public knowledge, a concept "as pertinent now as when it was written" [Sparck Jones and Willett, 1997, p. 86].  The author had an intended audience in mind when he or she wrote, but once the document is written and published, it is (like graffiti!) there for all to read. Search engines connect huge sets of authors with vast audiences of readers. The language used in queries and indexing vocabularies is bound to be loud and broad.
