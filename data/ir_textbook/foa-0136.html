 6.7 FOA (The Law)  The careful reader will have noticed that there have been an unusually large number of examples drawn from the legal domain. There are a number of things it can teach us about general principles of FOA [Belew,  1987a]. The common law tradition is very old and has been connected  to an organized corpus of documents in free text for a very long time. As the Doonesbury cartoon (part of Gary Trudeau's bicentennial series) in Figure 6.25 suggests, legal documents help to demonstrate just how long prose can live beyond its drafting. Hafner was one of the first to  recognize this, manually representing a wide range of attributes for a small number of documents in the legal domain [Hafner, 1978]. This work has now become a part of a larger effort within AI to model the legal reasoning process (e.g., reasoning by analogy [Ashley, 1990]).

All Rights Reserved  we are most concerned with what we can learn from lawyers who have FOA the law, which might generalize to other corpora and searchers.  First, the fact that judicial opinions have been written for so long and in such a particular "voice" has meant that it is also possible to consider special linguistic characteristics of this legal genre [Goodrich, 1987; Levi, 1982].  Second, notions of citation are especially well used within this corpus. Simple concepts like impact have been described [Shapiro, 1985), and theories of legal citation proposed [Merryman, 1977; Tapper, 1980; Ggden, 1993]. Obviously, manipulation of access to the legal printed record (for example, by controlling which judges' opinions are made available!) has enormous political ramifications [Brenner, 1992]. This became even more true because recent consolidation of the media 244      FINDING OUT ABOUT  industry means that one or two corporations effectively control the entire process of legal publication.  Third, the backbone of the legal process is an adversarial argument. This dialectic is often explicit, for example, as marked by the cf. and but of. citation conventions (cf. Section 6.1). The presence of such syntactic markers makes it conceivable to analyze polarization across an entire legal literature. Of course, the arguments contained in briefs and opinions have a great deal more structure than simple opposition. The analysis of legal argument structures, in conjunction with the textual foundations of common law, is perhaps the most important feature of the legal domain to FOA. On the one hand, it is possible to model individual documents and their logical features so as to reason about them [Hafher, 1978; McCarty, 1980]. Special deontic logics have been developed especially to deal with the concepts of "rights" and "obligations" that are at the heart of many legal relations [Lowe, 1985].  Statistical analyses of large document corpora may seem contrary to logical analyses of the arguments contained in each of them, and in fact this chasm runs very deep. Not only does it suggest different technology bases from the arsenal of (roughly inductive versus deductive) AI techniques, but it also reflects a tension within the law itself. Rose [Rose, 1994, p. 95] refers to a spectrum of legal philosophies ranging from "formalism" to "realism " On the one hand, many legal documents certainly seem to function logically, with careful definitions and reasoning that Langdell [Langdell, 1887] has idealized as "mechanical jurisprudence." At the same time, analyses such as the Critical Legal Studies [Unger, 1983] have helped to demonstrate that the law is just another social process.  It is exactly this dual nature of the law, and hence of legal texts, that makes it especially interesting as an example of FOA [Nerhot, 1991]. Individual applications include litigation support systems, which allow lawyers to search through the truckloads of documents involved in extended trials. On a much larger scale, systems like West Group5s WestLaw22 and Reed Elsevier's LEXIS23 systems provide access to the bulk of statutory and case law to all practicing lawyers [Cohen, 1991; Bing, 1987].  2* www. westiaw. ogxxl / 23 www.lexis.com INFERENCE BEYOND THE INDEX      245
