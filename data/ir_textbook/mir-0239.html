 12.4.3    Experiments Performance results with the GEMINI approach on time series are reported in [6]. There, the method is compared to a sequential scanning method. The R*-tree was used for the spatial access method within GEMINI. The sequences were artificially generated random walks, with length n = 1024; their number A7 varied from 50 to 400. Figure 12.5 shows the break-up of the response time, as a function of the number / of DFT coefficients kept. The diamonds, triangles, and squares indicate total time, post-processing time, and i?*-tree time, respectively. Notice that, as we keep more features /, the i?*~tree becomes bigger and slower, but more accurate (fewer false alarms, and therefore shorter post-processing time). This tradeoff reaches an equilibrium for / = 2 or 3. For the rest of the experiments, the / = 2 Fourier coefficients were kept for indexing, resulting in a four-dimensional i?*-tree (two real numbers for each complex DFT coefficient). 356        MULTIMEDIA IR: INDEXING AND SEARCHING p; 80 63	lt; gt;-----------------^óó ?

Figure 12.6 shows the response time for the two methods (GEMINI and sequential scan), as a function of the number of sequences N. Clearly, GEMINI outperforms the sequential scanning. The major conclusions from the application of GEMINI on time series are the following: (1J GEMINI can be successfully applied to time series, and specifically to the ones that behave like 'colored noises' (stock prices movements, currency exchange rates, water level in rivers etc.). (2) For signals with skewed spectrum like the above ones, the minimum in the response time is achieved for a small number of Fourier coefficients (/ = 1,2,3).   Moreover, the minimum is rather flat, which implies that TWO-DIMENSIONAL COLOR IMAGES        357 a suboptimal choice for / will give search time that is close to the minimum. Thus, with the help of the lower-bounding lemma and the energy-concentrating properties of the DFT, we managed to avoid the 'dimensionality curse.' (3) The success in ID series suggests that GEMINI is promising for 2D or higher-dimensionality signals, if those signals also have skewed spectrum. The success of JPEG (that uses DOT) indicates that real images indeed have a skewed spectrum. Finally, the method has been extended to handle subpattern matching; for time sequences, the details are in [249]. We only mention the main idea here. Assuming that query patterns have length of at least iu, we preprocess every sequence of the database, by allowing a sliding window of length w at each and every possible position, and by extracting the / features for a given positioning of the window. Thus, every sequence becomes a trail in the /-dimensional feature space, which can be further approximated by a set of few MBRs that cover it. Representing each sequence by a few MBRs in feature space may allow false alarms, but no false dismissals. The approach can be generalized for subpattern matching in 2D signals (and, in general, in n-dimensional vector fields).
