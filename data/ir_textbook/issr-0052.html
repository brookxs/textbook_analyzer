 4.2.2 Porter Stemming Algorithm  The Porter Algorithm is based upon a set of conditions of the stem, suffix and prefix and associated actions given the condition. Some examples of stem conditions are:  1. The measure, m, of a stem is a function of sequences of vowels (a, e, i, o, u, y) followed by a consonant. If V is a sequence of vowels and C is a sequence of consonants, then m is:  C(VC)mV 76  Chapter 4  where the initial C and final V are optional and m is the number   VC repeats.  Measure                          Example  rn=0                                 free, why  m=l                                frees, whose  m=2                                prologue, compute  2.   *lt;Xgt;            - stem ends with letter X  3.   *v*                - stem contains a vowel  4.   *d                 - stem ends in double consonant  5.   *o                 - stem ends with consonant-vowel-consonant sequence  where the final consonant is not w, x, or y  Suffix conditions take the form current_suffix = = pattern Actions are in the form old_suffix -gt; new_suffix  Rules are divided into steps to define the order of applying the rules.    The following are some examples of the rules:  STEP    CONDITION     SUFFIX  la 1b  Ibl1  1c  2  3 4  5a 5b  NULL  *v*  NULL *v* mgt;0 mgt;0  mgt;l   and and *lt;Lgt;  *d  sses ing at  y  aliti  icate  able  e NULL  REPLACEMENT EXAMPLE  ss stresses-gt;stress  NULL making-gt;mak  ate inflat(ed)-gt;inflate  i happy-gt;happi  al formaliti-gt; formal  ic duplicate-gt;duplic  NULL adjustable-gt;adjust  NULL inflate-gt;inflat  single letter control l-gt;control  Given process  the word   "duplicatable,"   the following are the steps in the stemming  dupSicat rule 4  duplicate rule Ibi  duplic rule 3  1 Ibl rules are expansion rules to make correction to stems for proper conflation. For example stemming of skies drops the es, making it ski, which Is the wrong concept and the I should be changed to y. Data Structure                                                                                             77  The application of another rule in step 4, removing "ic," can not be applied since only one rule from each step is allowed be applied.
