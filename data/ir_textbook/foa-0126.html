 6.3.3 Taxonomies  As their central role in WordNet suggests, the hierarchic BT/NT, or hypernymy, relations are especially important. Because of the constant analytic pressure of the Western intellectual tradition, topics continue  to be refined into smaller topics, which the next generation of scholars  immediately refines further. This has led to a wide range of classification taxonomies associated with various social groups of scholars and scientists. 218      FINDING OUT ABOUT  Library of Congress  LoC numbers subject headings  Assoc.

The single most important source of subject indexing is the Library of Congress (LoC). Its indexing system is the basis of most large libraries because it covers all disciplines. For exactly the same reason, however, the indexers at the LoC have too much to do, and the resulting indices are admittedly crude. Partly as a response to the lack of adequate indexing structures, various professional groups have developed their own taxonomies to help organize the information within their particular technical specialty. For example, the Association of Computing Machinery has developed the ACM Computing Reviews Classification15 for use by its Computing Reviews publication [ACM, 1986]. This taxonomy is much more specific, and therefore more widely used by computer specialists. However, it lacks many of the advantages of the LoC system. In general, the keywords are assigned by the authors rather than by trained librarians. The system is rarely, if ever, integrated into the operations of libraries. And although the indexing structure is  5 is6-www. infbrmatik .unl-dortmund. de/CRclass. html INFERENCE BEYOND THE INDEX      219  much more refined than that of the LoC, it is still too crude for most research currently going on in any subspecialty. This has caused some practitioners in various subspecialties to develop their own extensions. For example, David Waltz was commissioned by Scientific Data-Link to extend the ACM's Computing Reviews taxonomy for the sub-specialty of artificial intelligence [Waltz, 1985]. Waltz's extension is extremely refined and helpful to AI practitioners. At the same time, it is even more ad hoc, its "sponsoring institution" has less impact, and consequently it is even less well accepted within libraries.  All three of these indexing systems are examples of top-down knowledge structures. That is, they are developed by various social institutions as prescriptive languages used to represent the consensus opinion as to how information is to be organized. Such "consensual" knowledge structures are critical if individuals are to share information. Each indexing system represents a compromise between increased scope and diminished resolution. Increased scope brings along with it broader acceptance and adherence. These advantages occur at the expense of acceptance by users actively involved in technical specialties.  The central role of hierarchic BT/NT relations in organizing keyword vocabularies should make us especially concerned with a precise semantics for this relationship. Most would agree that if B is a broader term than A, then A "is a" B. But as knowledge engineers within AI have known for a long time, the ubiquitous IS_A relation admits a number of interpretations, which can support different types of inference [Brachman, 1979; Brachman, 1983]. In general, the BT/NT relation seems to correspond most closely to the "a kind of" implication relating predicates A andB:  (Vx)B(x)-gt; A(x)                              (6.11)  Earlier generations of Internet users participated in the construction of the extensive UseNet hierarchy16 of discussion boards, on topics from ALT.SEX.FETISH.ROBOTS to COMP.SYS.MAC.OOP.TCL; see  Section 7.5.5 for an example of the use of this hierarchy in text classification tasks.

One of the most exciting recent developments is the development of collaborative classification efforts such as the Open Directory Project (DMOZ)yls which involves large communities of experts, each working to make sense within his or her own area of expertise.
