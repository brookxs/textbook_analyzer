 9.3.3    Source Selection Source selection is the process of determining which of the distributed document collections are most likely to contain relevant documents for the current query, and therefore should receive the query for processing. One approach is to always assume that every collection is equally likely to contain relevant documents and simply broadcast the query to all collections. This approach is appropriate when documents are randomly partitioned or there is significant semantic overlap between the collections. When document collections are partitioned into semantically meaningful collections or it is prohibitively expensive to search every collection every time, the collections can be ranked according to their likelihood of containing relevant documents. The basic technique is to treat each collection as if it were a single large document, index the collections, and evaluate the query against the collections to produce a ranked listing of collections. We can apply a standard cosine similarity measure using a query vector and collection vectors. To calculate a term weight in the collection vector using tf-idf style weighting (see Chapter 2), term frequency tf-hJ is the total number of occurrences of term i in collection j, and the inverse document frequency idft for term i is log(JV/nj), where N is the total number of collections and nt is the number of collections in which terin i appears. A danger of this approach is that although a particular collection may receive a high query relevance score, there may not be individual documents within the collection that receive a high query relevance score, essentially resulting in a false drop and unnecessary work to score the collection. Moffat and Zobel [574] DISTRIBUTED IR        253 propose avoiding this problem by indexing each collection as a series of blocks, where each block contains B documents. When B equals 1, this is equivalent to indexing all of the documents as a single, monolithic collection. When B equals the number of documents in each collection, this is equivalent to the original solution. By varying Â£?, a tradeoff is made between collection index size and likelihood of false drops. An alternative to searching a collection index was proposed by Voorhees [792], who proposes using training queries to build a content model for the distributed collections. When a new query is submitted to the system, its similarity to the training queries is computed and the content model is used to determine which collections should be searched and how many hits from each collection should be returned.
