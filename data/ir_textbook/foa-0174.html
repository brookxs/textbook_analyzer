 8.2.3 Argument Structures  Another important notion of context surrounding any particular document is the system of argumentation within which it participates.  The tendency of search engines to slice and dice documents into salads of their constituent words has been called the bag-of-words phenomenon. It is typically used in contrast to syntactic parsing methods, which place these words as part of well-structured, grammatical constructs. But there is another level of violence done to language when word frequency counts are collected, and that has to do with the argument structures by which sentences are strung together to form persuasive communicative acts.  Many of modern cultures' most well-documented communications involve the use of language as a persuasive device. Mathematical theorem proving, legal opinions, scientific papers, Op-Ed newspaper and magazine pages, artistic criticism, all have in common the fundamental purpose of convincing an audience.  A mathematical paper (purportedly!)* convinces by proving theorems. In legal corpora, the fundamental principle of stare decisis on which the common law tradition is based has already been mentioned. Within science, varying disciplines have wildly differing standards for what constitutes a convincing argument. Political and artistic forms of  Math proofs are more informal than you may think? 306      FINDING OUT ABOUT  persuasion are being changed as they move from the media of newspapers and magazines to the WWW.  While the modes of argument supporting each of these social activities have diverged, there remains a common thread connecting all such documents, viz., their common heritage as written artifacts. Since long strips of papyrus were first rolled onto scrolls, our expectations about a fundamentally linear progression through a text have held. The Greeks' theories of narrative and rhetoric, analyzing how good stories and persuasive arguments are constructed, are still worth knowing today. Clearly these theories were shaped by the linear media of scrolls and books that then conveyed culture. The fundamentally nonlinear capabilities of hypertext media seem to open the door to radically different notions of argument. On the other hand, many modern theories of cognition continue to highlight the fundamentally linear and sequential flow of human attention [Newell, 1990]; we can only think about one thing at a time, no matter how fast we click. It will probably be artists, using new forms of media and hypertext authorship, who teach us the most about how these new technologies can be used most expressively. It is still too early to tell how our existing social institutions will absorb these technological changes. Attempts to index musical content offer some glimpses of the future [Bakhmutova et al, 1997; Foote, 1997; Ghias et al, 1995; Wold etal, 1996].  The editors dual  representation of a document
