One of the most critical aspects of an information system that determines its effectiveness is how it represents concepts in items. The transformation from the received item to the searchable data structure is called Indexing, This process can be manual or automatic, creating the basis for direct search of items in the Document Database or indirect search via Index Files. Rather than trying to create a searchable data structure that directly maps to the text in the input items, some systems transform the item into a completely different representation that is concept based and use this as the searchable data structure. The concept weighting schemes have demonstrated the capability to find items that the traditional weighted and non-weighted data structures have missed. Systems that use a specialized hardware text search processor do not require the searchable data structure, but search the original standardized documents (see Chapter 9).  Once the searchable data structure has been created, techniques must be defined that correlate the user-entered query statement to the set of items in the database to determine the items to be returned to the user. This process is called Search and is often different between searches applied to the document database (called ad hoc queries) and searches against incoming items to determine the Mail File(s) the item should be delivered to (called dissemination searches). In the newer systems a by-product of the search process is a relative value for each item 52                                                                                                Chapter 3  with respect to its correlation to the query constraints. This value is used in ranking the item. In some cases a simplified ranking algorithm is applied to the items found from the search process after it is completed.  Closely associated with the indexing process is the information extraction process. Its goal is to extract specific information to be normalized and entered into a structured database (DBMS). It is similar to the process of creating the search structure for an item in that both must locate concepts in the item. Information extraction differs because it focuses on very specific concepts and contains a transformation process that modifies the extracted information into a form compatible with the end structured database. This process was referred to in Chapter 2 as Automatic File Build. Another way information extraction can be used is in the generation of a summary of an item. The emphasis changes from extracting facts to go into index fields to extracting larger contextual constructs (e.g., sentences) that are combined to form a summary of an item.
