    Biword indexes One approach to handling phrases is to consider every pair of consecutive terms in a document as a phrase. For example, the text Friends, Romans, Countrymen would generate the biwords : friends romans romans countrymen ``stanford university'' AND ``university palo'' AND ``palo alto'' Among possible queries, nouns and noun phrases have a special status in describing the concepts people are interested in searching for. But related nouns can often be divided from each other by various function words, in phrases such as the abolition of slavery or renegotiation of the constitution. These needs can be incorporated into the biword indexing model in the following way. First, we tokenize the text and perform part-of-speech-tagging.We can then group terms into nouns, including proper nouns, (N) and function words, including articles and prepositions, (X), among other classes. Now deem any string of terms of the form NX*N to be an extended biword. Each such extended biword is made a term in the vocabulary. For example: renegotiation of the constitution N X X N This algorithm does not always work in an intuitively optimal manner when parsing longer queries into Boolean queries. Using the above algorithm, the query cost overruns on a power plant ``cost overruns'' AND ``overruns power'' AND ``power plant'' The concept of a biword index can be extended to longer sequences of words, and if the index includes variable length word sequences, it is generally referred to as a phrase index . Indeed, searches for a single term are not naturally handled in a biword index (you would need to scan the dictionary for all biwords containing the term), and so we also need to have an index of single-word terms. While there is always a chance of false positive matches, the chance of a false positive match on indexed phrases of length 3 or more becomes very small indeed. But on the other hand, storing longer phrases has the potential to greatly expand the vocabulary size. Maintaining exhaustive phrase indexes for phrases of length greater than two is a daunting prospect, and even use of an exhaustive biword dictionary greatly expands the size of the vocabulary. However, towards the end of this section we discuss the utility of the strategy of using a partial phrase index in a compound indexing scheme.
