 12.6    Automatic Feature Extraction GEMINI is useful for any setting that we can extract features from.   In fact, algorithms for automatic feature extraction methods exist, like the 'MultidimenTRENDS AND RESEARCH ISSUES        361 2000		Total ti CPUti CPU time for na	ne - GEMINI ------ me-GEMINI ó-  -we sequential ive sequential 0000			8000			6000 4000		___------óó	--------------------------' _------0 Figure 12.9    Response time vs. selectivity, for the sequential ('naive') retrieval and for GEMINI. sional Scaling' (MDS) and 'FastMap.' Extracting features not only facilitates the use of off-the-shelf spatial access methods, but it also allows for visual data mining: we can plot a 2D or 3D projection of the data set, and inspect it for clusters, correlations, and other patterns. Figure 12.10 shows the results of FastMap on 35 documents of seven classes, after deriving k = 3 features/dimensions. The classes include basketball reports ('Bbr'), abstracts of computer science technical reports (cAbs5), cooking recipes ('Rec'), and so on. The distance function was a decreasing function of the cosine similarity. The figure shows the 3D scatter-plot, (a) in its entirety and (b) after zooming into the center, to highlight the clustering abilities of FastMap. Notice that the seven classes are separated well, in only k = 3 dimensions.
