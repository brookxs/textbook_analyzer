 3.3.5 Weighting the Index Relation  The simplest notion of an index is binary- either a keyword is associated with a document or it is not. But it is natural to imagine degrees of about-ness. We will capture this strength of association with a single real number, a weight, capturing the strength of the relationship between keyword and document. This weight can be used in two different ways. The first is to reduce the number of links to only the most significant relationships, those with the highest weights. In this respect a weighted indexing system is a more general formulation than a binary formulation; we can always go to a binary relation from the weighted one. This might make weights useful even if our retrieval method is Boolean (as it often was in early information retrieval (IR) systems). But a second and today more common reason for using a weighted indexing relation is that the retrieval method can exploit these weights directly. 82      FINDING OUT ABOUT  One way to describe what this number means is probabilistic: We seek a measure of a document's relevance, conditionalized on the belief that a keyword is relevant:  Wkd c* ?r(^ relevant | k relevant)                   (3.10)  Note that this is a directed relation; we may or may not believe that the symmetric relation  Wdk âˆž^ Pr(^ relevant | d relevant)                   (3.11)  should be the same. Unless otherwise specified, when we refer to a weight w we will intend it to mean Wkd In order to compute statistical estimates for such probabilities we define several important quantities:  fkd = number of occurrences of keyword k in document d fk = total number of occurrences of keyword k across entire corpus Djfc = number of documents containing keyword k                  (3.12)  We will make two demands on the weight reflecting the degree to which a document is about a particular keyword or topic. The first one goes back to Luhn's central observation [Luhn, 1961]: Repetition is an indication of emphasis. If an author uses a word frequently, it is because he or she thinks it's important. Define fkd to be the number of occurrences of keyword k in a document d.  Our second concern is that a keyword be a useful discriminator within the context of the corpus. Capturing this notion of corpus-context statistically proves much more difficult; for now, we simply give it the name discrim^.  Because we care about both, we will devise our weight to be the product of the two factors, corresponding to their conjunction:  u*kd oc fkd ' discrimk                                (3.13)  We will now consider several different index weighting schemes that have been suggested over the years. These all share the same reliance on f^ as a measure of keyword importance within the document and the same product form as Equation 3.13. What they do not share WEIGHTING AND MATCHING AGAINST INDICES       83  is how best to quantify the discrimination power discrintk  of the keyword.
