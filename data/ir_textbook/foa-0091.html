 5.2.4 How Many Dimensions k to Reduce To?  A central question remains: How many dimensions k should be used? To date, the only answers are empirical. Early experiments suggest that  using too few dimensions dramatically degrades performance.^ The original MED corpus used in early LSI experiments [Deerwester et aL, 1990; Dumais, 1991] happens to be distinguished by a particularly topically focused vocabulary. While a few hundred dimensions may suffice to discriminate this small set of documents, it might be necessary to use more dimensions when describing a broader domain of discourse.

From [Landauer and Dumais, 1997]. Reproduced with permission of the Association of Computing Machinery  Empirically, however, reduction to around 500 dimensions seems to provide significant improvements to even very large corpora. For example, Figure 5.5 shows one experiment [Landauer and Dumais, 1997], where/: is varied over four orders of magnitude. Some attempts to select k theoretically, borrowing a rank-plus-shift method from signal processing, have also been made [Zha and Zhang, 1998]. The most satisfying answer may come from probabilistic models that relate the raw frequency statistics to an underlying distribution [Papadimitriou et al., 1998; Hoffman, 1999].
