 1.3.2    Information Retrieval in the Library Libraries were among the first institutions to adopt IR systems for retrieving information. Usually, systems to be used in libraries were initially developed by academic institutions and later by commercial vendors. In the first generation, such systems consisted basically of an automation of previous technologies (such as card catalogs) and basically allowed searches based on author name and title. In the second generation, increased search functionality was added which allowed searching by subject headings, by keywords, and some more complex query facilities. In the third generation, which is currently being deployed, the focus is on improved graphical interfaces, electronic forms, hypertext features, and open system architectures. Traditional library management system vendors include Endeavor Information Systems Inc., Innovative Interfaces Inc., and EOS International. Among systems developed with a research focus and used in academic libraries, we distinguish Okapi (at City University, London), MELVYL (at University of California), and Cheshire II (at UC Berkeley). Further details on these library systems can be found in Chapter 14.
