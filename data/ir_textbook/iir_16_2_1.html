    Cardinality - the number of clusters  cardinality       16.3  Since our goal is to optimize an objective function, clustering is essentially a search problem. The brute force solution would be to enumerate all possible clusterings and pick the best. However, there are exponentially many partitions, so this approach is not feasible. For this reason, most flat clustering algorithms refine an initial partitioning iteratively. If the search starts at an unfavorable initial point, we may miss the global optimum. Finding a good starting point is therefore another important problem we have to solve in flat clustering.
