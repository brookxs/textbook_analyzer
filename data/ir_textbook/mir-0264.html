 13.6    Metasearchers Metasearchers are Web servers that send a given query to several search engines, Web directories and other databases, collect the answers and unify them. Examples are Metacrawler [715] and SawySearch [383, 223]. The main advantages of metasearchers are the ability to combine the results of many sources and the fact that the user can pose the same query to various sources through a single common interface. Metasearchers differ from each other in how ranking 388        SEARCHING THE WEB Metasearcher	URL	Sources used Cyber 411	www.cyber411.com	14 Dogpile	www.dogpile.com	25 Highway 61	www. higliway61. com	5 Inference Find	www.infind.com	6 Mamma	www.mamma.coin	7 MetaCrawler	www.metacrawler.com	7 MetaFind	www.met af ind.c om	7 MetaMiner	www.miner.uol.com.br	13 MetaSearch	www.metasearch.com	_ SavvySearch	savvy.cs.colostate.edu:2000	gt;13 Table 13.5    URLs of metasearchers and number of sources that they use (October 1998). is performed in the unified result (in some cases no ranking is done), and how well they translate the user query to the specific query language of each search engine or Web directory (the query language common to all of them could be small). Table 13.5 shows the URLs of the main metasearch engines as well as the number of search engines, Web directories and other databases that they search. Metasearchers can also run on the client, for example, Copernic, EchoSearch, WebFerret, WebCompass, and WebSeeker. There are others that search several sources and show the different answers in separate windows, such as A1140ne, OneSeek, Proteus, and Search Spaniel. The advantages of metasearchers are that the results can be sorted by different attributes such as host, keyword, date, etc; which can be more informative than the output of a single search engine. Therefore browsing the results should be simpler. On the other hand, the result is not necessarily all the Web pages matching the query, as the number of results per search engine retrieved by the metasearcher is limited (it can be changed by the user, but there is an upper limit). Nevertheless, pages returned by more than one search engine should be more relevant. We expect that new metasearchers will do better ranking. A first step in this direction is the NEC Research Institute metasearch engine, Inquirus [488, 489]. The main difference is that Inquirus actually downloads and analyzes each Web page obtained and then displays each page, highlighting the places where the query terms were found. The results are displayed as soon as they are available in a progressive manner, otherwise the waiting time would be too long. This technique also allows non-existent pages or pages that have changed and do not contain the query any more to be discarded, and. more important, provides for better ranking than normal search engines. On the other hand, this inetajsoaivher is not available to the general public.

The use of metasearchers is justified by coverage studies that show that a small percentage of Web pages are in all search engines [91]. In fact, fewer than 1% of the Web pages indexed by AltaVista, HotBot, Excite, and Infoseek are in all of those search engines. This fact is quite surprising and has not been explained (yet). Metasearchers for specific topics can be considered as software agents and are covered in section 13.8.2.
