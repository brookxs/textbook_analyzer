 5.4.1    Query Expansion based on a Similarity Thesaurus In this section we discuss a query expansion model based on a global similarity thesaurus which is constructed automatically [655]. The similarity thesaurus is based on term to term relationships rather than on a matrix of co-occurrence (as discussed in section 5.3). The distinction is made clear in the discussion below. Furthermore, special attention is paid to the selection of terms for expansion and to the reweighting of these terms. In contrast to previous global analysis approaches, terms for expansion are selected based on their similarity to the whole query rather than on their similarities to individual query terms. A similarity thesaurus is built considering term to term relationships. However, such relationships are not derived directly from co-occurrence of terms inside documents. Rather, they are obtained by considering that the terms are concepts in a concept space. In this concept space, each term is indexed by the documents in which it appears. Thus, terms assume the original role of documents while documents are interpreted as indexing elements. The following definitions establish the proper framework. Definition As before (see Chapter 2), let t he the number of terms in the collection, N be the number of documents in the collection, and fx j be the frequency 132        QUERY OPERATIONS of occurrence of the term k{ in the document dj. Further, let tj be the number of distinct index terms in the document dj and itfj be the inverse term frequency for document dj. Then, t itfj = log ó analogously to the definition of inverse document frequency. Within this framework, to each term k{ is associated a vector fc$ given by where, as in Chapter 2, Wi0 is a weight associated to the index-document pair [ki,dj]. Here, however, these weights are computed in a rather distinct form as follows. where maxj(fij) computes the maximum of all factors /^ for the i-th term (i.e., over all documents in the collection). We notice that the expression above is a variant of tf-idf weights hut one which considers inverse term frequencies instead. The relationship between two terms ku and kv is computed as a correlation factor cu^v given by wuj x wvj                                               (5.12) We notice that this is a variation of the correlation measure used for computing scalar association matrices (defined by Equation 5.5). The main difference is that the weights are based on interpreting documents as indexing elements instead of repositories for term co-occurrence. The global similarity thesaurus is built through the computation of the correlation factor cu,v for each pair of indexing terms [ku,kv] in the collection (analogously to the procedure in section 5.3). Of course, this is computationally expensive. However, this global similarity thesaurus has to be computed only once and can be updated incrementally. Given the global similarity thesaurus, query expansion is done in three steps as follows. ï First, represent the query in the concept space used for representation of the index terms. AUTOMATIC GLOBAL ANALYSIS        133 ï  Second, based on the global similarity thesaurus, compute a similarity sirn(q,kv) between each term kv correlated to the query terms and the whole query q. ï  Third,  expand the query with the top r  ranked terms  according to sim(q, kv). For the first step, the query is represented in the concept space of index term vectors as follows. Definition     To the query q is associated a vector q in the term-concept space given by q= y}Twliqki where Wi,q is a weight associated to the index-query pair [kt,q].   This weight is computed analogously to the index-document weight formula in equation 5.11. For the second step, a similarity sim(q, kv) between each term kv (correlated to the query terms) and the user query q is computed as sim(q,kv) = q- kv = kueQ where cu,v is the correlation factor given in equation 5.12. As illustrated in Figure 5.2, a term might be quite close to the whole query while its distances to individual query terms are larger. This implies that the terms selected here for query expansion might be distinct from those selected by previous global analysis methods (which adopted a similarity to individual query terms for deciding terms for query expansion). For the third step, the top r ranked terms according to sim(q, kv) are added to the original query q to form the expanded query q . To each expansion term kv in the query q is assigned a weight wvq' given by ^ _   sirnjq.ky) Wv,q    ~~ Np The expanded query q is then used to retrieve new documents to the user. This completes the technique for query expansion based on a similarity thesaurus. Contrary to previous global analysis approaches, this technique has yielded improved retrieval performance (in the range of 20%) with three different collections. It is worthwhile making one final observation. Consider a document dj which is represented in the term-concept space by dj = *%2ktÄd u?ij^´- Further, assume that the original query q is expanded to include all tne t index terms 134        QUERY OPERATIONS Q=lKa,Kb) Figure 5.2    The distance of a given term kv to the query centroid Qc might be quite distinct from the distances of kv to the individual query terms. (properly weighted) in the collection.  Then, the similarity sim(q^dj) between the document dj and the query q can be computed in the term-concept space by E vj X wu,q X cu,v Such an expression is analogous to the formula for query-document similarity in the generalized vector space model (see Chapter 2). Thus, the generalized vector space model can be interpreted as a query expansion technique. The main differences with the term-concept idea are the weight computation and the fact that only the top r ranked terms are used for query expansion with the term-concept technique.
