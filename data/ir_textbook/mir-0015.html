 1.5    Organization of the Book For ease of comprehension, this book has a straightforward structure in which four main parts are distinguished: text IR, human-computer interaction (HCI) ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK 11 for IR, multimedia IR, and applications of IR. Text IR discusses the classic problem of searching a collection of documents for useful information. HCI for IR discusses current trends in IR towards improved user interfaces and better data visualization tools. Multimedia IR discusses how to index document images and other binary data by extracting features from their content and how to search them efficiently. On the other hand, document images that are predominantly text (rather than pictures) are called textual images and are amenable to automatic extraction of keywords through metadescriptors, and can be retrieved using text IR techniques. Applications of IR covers modern applications of IR such as the Web, bibliographic systems, and digital libraries. Each part is divided into topics which we now discuss.
