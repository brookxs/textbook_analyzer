 The idea here is that the user explores a document space which has a flat organization. For instance, the documents might be represented as dots in a (two-dimensional) plan or as elements in a (single dimension) list. The user then glances here and there looking for information within the documents visited. For instance, he might look for correlations among neighbor documents or for keywords which are of interest to Mm. Such keywords could then be added to the original query in an attempt to provide better contextualization. This is a process called relevance feedback which is discussed in detail in Chapter 5. Also, the user could explore a single document in a flat manner. For example, he could use a browser to look into a Web page, using the arrows and the scroll bar. One disadvantage is that in a given page or screen there may not be any indication about the context where the user is. For example, if he opens a novel at a random page, he might not know in which chapter that page is. Web search engines such as "Yahoo!1 provide, besides the standard search interface, a hierarchical directory which can be used for browsing (and frequently, for searching). However, the organization is not flat as discussed below. 66        MODELING
