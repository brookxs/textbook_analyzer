 1.3.5 Multimedia Database Search  Chapter 10 provides additional details associated with multi-media search against different modalities of information. From a system perspective, the multimedia data is not logically its own data structure, but an augmentation to the existing structures in the Information Retrieval System. It will reside almost entirely in the area described as the Document Database. The specialized indexes to allow search of the multi-media (e.g., vectors representing video and still images, text created by audio transcription) will be augmented search structures. The original source will be kept as normalized digital real source for access possibly in their own specialized retrieval servers (e.g., the Real Media server, ORACLE Video Server, etc.) The correlation between the multi-media and the textual domains will be either via time or positional synchronization. Time synchronization is the example of transcribed text from audio or composite video sources. Positional synchronization is where the multi-media is localized by a hyperlink in a textual item. The synchronization can be used to increase the precision of the search process. Added relevance weights should be assigned when the multi-media search and the textual search result in hits in close proximity. For example when the image of Tony Blair is found in the section of a video where the transcribed audio is discussingTony Blair, then the hit is more likely then when either event occurs independently. The same would be true when the JPEG image hits on Tony Blair in a textual paragraph discussing him in an HTML item.  Making the multi-media data part of the Document Database also implies that the linking of it to Private and Public Index files will also operate the same way as with text.
