 6.3.1    Formats There is no single format for a text document, and an IR system should be able to retrieve information from many of them. In the past, IR systems would convert a document to an internal format. However, that has many disadvantages, because the original application related to the document is not useful any more. On top of that, we cannot change the contents of a document. Current IR systems have filters that can handle most popular documents, in particular those of word processors with some binary syntax such as Word, WordPerfect or FrameMaker. Even then, good filters might not be possible if the format is proprietary and its details are not public. This is not the case for full ASCII syntax, as in TeX documents. Although documents can be in a binary format (for example, parts of a Word document), documents that are represented in human-readable ASCII form imply more portability and are easier to modify (for example, they can be edited with different applications). Other text formats were developed for document interchange. Among these we should mention the Rich Text Format (RTF), which is used by word processors and has ASCII syntax. Other important formats were developed for displaying or printing documents. The most popular ones are the Portable Document Format (PDF) and Postscript (which is a powerful programming language for drawing). Other interchange formats are used to encode electronic mail, for example MIME (Multipurpose internet Mail Exchange). MIME supports multiple character sets, multiple languages, and multiple media. On top of these formats, nowadays many files are compressed. Text compression is treated in detail in Chapter 7, but here we comment on the most TEXT        145 popular compression software and associated formats. These include Compress (Unix), ARJ (PCs), and ZIP (for example gzip in Unix and Winzip in Windows). Other tools allow us to convert binary files, in particular compressed text, to ASCII text such that it can be transmitted through a communication line using only seven bits. Examples of these tools are uuencode/uudecode and binhex.
