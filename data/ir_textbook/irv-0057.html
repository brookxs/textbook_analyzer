 Bibliographic remarks  The book by Lancaster and Fayen[16] contains details of many operational on-line systems. Barraclough[17] has written an interesting survey article about on-line searching. Discussions on search strategies are usually found embedded in more general papers on information retrieval. There are, however, a few specialist references worth mentioning.  Anew classic paper on the limitations of a Boolean search is Verhoeff et al.[18]. Miller[19] has tried to get away from a simple Boolean search by introducing a form of weighting although maintaining essentially a Boolean search. Angione[20] discusses the equivalence of Boolean and weighted searching. Rickman[21] has described a way of introducing automatic feedback into a Boolean search. Goffman[22] has investigated an interesting search strategy based on the idea that the relevance of a document to a query is conditional on the relevance of other documents to that query. In an early paper by Hyvarinen[23], one will find an information-theoretic definition of the 'typical member' cluster representative. Negoita[24] gives a theoretical discussion of a bottom-up search strategy in the context of cluster-based retrieval. Much of the early work on relevance feedback done on the SMART project has now been reprinted in Salton[25]. Two other independence pieces of work on feedback are Stanfel[26] and Bono[27].
