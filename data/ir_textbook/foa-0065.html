 4.2.2 Using relevance feedback to Adapt Documents' Indices  An alternative use of relevance feedback is to make changes to the documents rather than to the query. Previously, the argument was that it is sensible to make the query look more like those documents the users liked; now the argument is the converse: Documents found relevant to a query should be described more like the query used to identify them. Changes made to document vectors according to this heuristic are known as document modifications and are shown in Figure 4.7.  Note that unlike query modification, adaptive document modifications made in response to ReWhkre not expected to be of (immediate) use to the users who provide it. Instead, the hope is that these changed document representations will be available later, to others who might be searching. As Salton [Salton and McGill, 1983] described the goal: 116      FINDING OUT ABOUT  Following a large number of such interactions documents which are wanted by the users will have been moved slowly into the active portion of the document space - that part in which large numbers of users' queries are concentrated, while items which are normally rejected will be located on the periphery of the space, [p. 145]  This provocative proposal, allowing a search engine to learn from its users, is considered in much greater detail in Chapter 7.
