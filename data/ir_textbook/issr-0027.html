 2.2.3 Highlighting  Another display aid is an indication of why an item was selected. This indication, frequently highlighting, lets the user quickly focus on the potentially  relevant parts of the text to scan for item relevance. Different strengths of highlighting indicates how strongly the highlighted word participated in the  selection of the item. Most systems allow the display of an item to begin with the first highlight within the item and allow subsequent jumping to the next highlight. Another capability, which is gaining strong acceptance, is for the system to determine the passage in the document most relevant to the query and position the browse to start at that passage. The DCARS system that acts as a user frontend to the RetrievalWare search system allows the user to browse an item in the order of the paragraphs or individual words that contributed most to the rank value associated with the item.  Highlighting has always been useful in Boolean systems to indicate the cause of the retrieval This is because of the direct mapping between the terms in the search and the terms in the item. Using Natural Language Processing, automatic expansion of terms via thesauri, and the similarity ranking algorithms Information Retrieval System Capabilities                                                    41  discussed in detail later in this book, highlighting loses some of its value The terms being highlighted that caused a particular item to be returned may not have direct or obvious mapping to any of the search terms entered. This causes frustration by the user trying to guess why a particular item was retrieved and how to use that information in reformulating the search statement to make it more exact. In a ranking system different terms can contribute to different degrees to the decision to retrieve an item. The highlighting may vary by introducing colors and intensities to indicate the relative importance of a particular word in the item in the decision to retrieve the item. Information visualization appears to be a better display process to assist in helping the user formulate his query than highlights in items.
