 3.2.5 More Recent Zipfian Sightings  The debate concerning these models dates back almost 40 years, but Zipfian distributions and attempts to explain them continue to arise. For example, many have been struck by language-like properties exhibited by  the long sequences of genetic codes found in the DNA of all living species. That is, a simple "alphabet" of four nucleic acid base-pairs (BPs) (A, C,  G, T in DNA) grouped into three-letter codons that mean one of twenty  possible "words" corresponding to amino acids has led many to wonder what we might learn by viewing the genome as a linguistic object [Sereno,  1991].  Mantegna et al. [Mantegna et ai, 1994] was led to consider the "word" frequency distributions of such words in the DNA "corpus." They considered differences in the distributions across coding regions of the WEIGHTING AND MATCHING AGAINST INDICES       69  genome as well as noncoding regions that are never expressed. Their first result is that this sequence data does indeed contain "linguistic features," especially in the noncoding regions. By analyzing various genetic corpora (e.g., approximately a million BPs taken from 14 mammalian sequences), they found that, in contrast to what we might expect of completely random sequences, the rank-frequency distribution of six-BP words could be well fit by a (log-log linear) Zipf exponent equal to ó0.28. They conclude:  These results are consistent with the possible existence of one (or more than one) structured biological languages present in noncoding DNA sequences. [Mantegna et al., 1994, italic not in original]  Subsequent analysis, however, makes it quite clear that any such interpretations are ill-founded [Bonhoeffer et al., 1996]. Deviations from fully random sequence behavior can be attributed to two simple characteristics of biological sequence data. First, define H(n) to be the entropy of the distribution of n-length nucleotide sequences. Then the redundancy R(n) of length n words is:  R(n) = 1-^1                             (3.3)  In  so the nonrandom R{ 1) reflects a simple increase with the variance of the four base-pairs, a well-known biological fact. Further, very short range correlations between nucleic acids (easy to imagine given the basic threeletter genetic code) means that in DNA the most common words are simply combinations of the most probable letters, especially in regions of short repeats. There are still interesting questions (e.g., why coding and noncoding regions differ in their nucleic acid frequencies), but none that suggest any large-scale language-like properties within the DNA sequence.  A final recent example of how Zipf-like distributions arise is offered by analyses of WWW surfing behaviors [Huberman et al., 1998] and makes this same point (but cf. Section 8.1 for more recent, apparently contradictory data generated from massive Alta Vista logs). Consider each page click by a browsing user to be a "character" and the amount of time spent by the same user on a host to be the length of a 41 word." Then (surprise!), empirical data capturing the rank-frequency 70      FINDING OUT ABOUT  1000 i  *    100 o  10 1                          10                       100                        1000  log(Clicks)  FIGURE 3.2 Rank/Frequency Distribution of Click-Paths From [Huberman, 1998]. Reprinted with permission of Science  distribution of each WWW surfing "ride" again show a (log-log linear) Zipfian relationship with slope equal to ó1.5, as shown in Figure 3.2.  Huberman et al. also propose a model explaining this empirical data. Assume that the "value" (what we might think of as perceived relevance) V{L) of each page in a browsing sequence of length L goes up or down according to identical, independently distributed (iid) Gaussian random variables 6^:  V(L) = V(L- 1) + ÄL                          (3.4)  Using economic reasoning, Huberman et al. then hypothesize:  ... an individual will continue to surf until the expected cost of continuing is perceived to be larger than the discounted expected  value of the information to be found in the future___Even if  the value of the current page is negative, it may be worthwhile  to proceed, because a collection of high value pages may still be found. If the value is sufficiently negative, however, then it is no longer worth the risk to continue. [Huberman et al., 1998]  If users' browsing behaviors follow a random walk governed by these considerations, Huberman et al. show that the passage times to this cutoff threshold are given by the inverse Gaussian distribution:  (3.5) WEIGHTING AND MATCHING AGAINST INDICES       71  where \i is the mean of the random walk length variable Ly fi3/k is its variance, and A is a scaling parameter.
