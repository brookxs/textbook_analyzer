 12.5.3    Experiments We now present experimental results [244] with GEMINI on color, using the bounding theorem, The experiments compare the relative performance (in terms of CPU time and disk accesses) between first, simple sequential evaluation of dhist f∞r a^ database vectors (referred to as 'naive'), and second, GEMINI. The experiments report the total and the CPU times required by the methods, by performing simulations on a database of N = 924 color image histograms, each of A; = 256 colors, of assorted natural images. Results are shown in Figure 12.9, which presents the total response time as a function of the selectivity (ratio of actual hits over the database size N). The figure also shows the CPU time for each method. Notice that, even for a selectivity of 5% (which would return ~ 50 images to the user), the GEMINI method is much faster than the straightforward, sequential computation of the histogram distances. In fact, it requires from a fraction of a second up to ´ 4 seconds, while the naive method requires consistently ´ 10 seconds. Moreover, notice that for larger databases, the naive method will have a linearly increasing response time. Thus, the conclusions are the following: ï  The GEMINI approach (i.e., the idea to extract some features for a quick-and-dirty test) motivated a fast method, using the average RGB distance; it also motivated a strong theorem (the so-called QDB theorem [244]) which guarantees the correctness in our case. ï  In addition to resolving the cross-talk problem, GEMINI solved the 'dimensionality curse' problem at no extra cost, requiring only / = 3 features, as opposed to k = 64 or 256 that dhtst{) required.
