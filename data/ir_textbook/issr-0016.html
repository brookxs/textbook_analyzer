The semantic concept is that the closer two terms are  SEARCH STATEMENT         SYSTEM OPERATION  COMPUTER OR PROCESSOR NOT Select all items discussing Computers MAINFRAME                                        and/or Processors that do not discuss  Mainframes  COMPUTER OR (PROCESSOR NOT Select all items discussing Computers MAINFRAME)                                       and/or items that discuss Processors and  do not discuss Mainframes  COMPUTER AND NOT PROCESSOR Select all items that discuss computers OR MAINFRAME                                   and not processors or mainframes in the  item  Figure 2.1 Use of Boolean Operators  found in a text the more likely they are related in the description of a particular concept. Proximity is used to increase the precision of a search. If the terms COMPUTER and DESIGN are found within a few words of each other then the item is more likely to be discussing the design of computers than if the words are paragraphs apart. The typical format for proximity is:  TERM! within "m" "units" of TERM2  The distance operator "m" is an integer number and units are in Characters,  Words, Sentences, or Paragraphs. Certain items may have other semantic units that would prove useful in specifying the proximity operation. For very structured items, distances in characters prove useful. For items containing imbedded images (e.g., digital photographs), text between the images could help in precision when  the objective is in locating a certain image. Sometimes the proximity relationship  contains a direction operator indicating the direction (before or after) that the second term must be found within the number of units specified. The default is either direction. A special case of the Proximity operator is the Adjacent (ADJ) operator that normally has a distance operator of one and a forward only direction (i.e., in WAIS). Another special case Is where the distance is set to zero meaning within the same semantic unit. Some proximity search statement examples and their meanings are given in Figure 2.2.
