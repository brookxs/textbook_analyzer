 1.4.4 Genre  A more subtle characteristic of documents that may need to concern  us is their genre - the voice or style in which a document is written.  You would, um, like, be pretty darn surprised to find stuff like this in a textbook, but not if it came to you over the phone. The genre of email seems to be settling somewhere between typical printed media and spoken conversation, with special markings of sarcasm:) and expletives #! ?% common. Newspaper journalists are carefully trained to produce articles  A misleading title, or did the document teach you something? S 22       FINDING OUT ABOUT  consistent with what newspaper readers expect, and their editors are paid to ensure that these stories maintain a consistent voice. Scientific journal articles are written to be understood by peers in the same field, according to standards that pertain to that community [Bayerman, 1988]. An important component of this audience focus is the vocabulary choice an author makes (cf. Section 8.2.1); stylistic variations and document structure may also differ. In a field like psychology, for example, it would be difficult to get a paper accepted in some journals if it is not subdivided into sections like Hypothesis, Methodology, and Subjects. Legal briefs are also written in highly conventionalized forms [Havard Law Review Association, 1995], and legislation is drafted to satisfy political realities [Allen, 1980; Goodrich, 1987; Levi, 1982; Nerhot, 1991].  In part, these variations in genre are difficult to detect because they remain consistent within any single corpus. That is, the typical email message would jump out at you as out of place if it appeared in your newspaper, but probably not if it were on the Letters to the Editor page. These examples highlight how much context about the corpus we bring with us whenever we read a particular document. They also foreshadow problems Web searchers are just beginning to appreciate, as WWW search engines include every document to which they can crawl, intermixing their very different contexts and writing styles. Without the orienting features of the newspaper's masthead, the "Letters to the Editor" rubric, or the purposeful selection of a tool that scans only Usenet news, the browsing users' abilities to understand an arbitrary document is diminished. Individual textual passages have been stripped of much of the context that made them sensible. As more and more of us generate content- in new hypermedia forms as well as traditional publications - that more and more of us retrieve, the range of genres we will experience can only increase, and our methods for FOA must help to represent not just the document but contextual information as well.
