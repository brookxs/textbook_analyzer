 5.2.5 Other Uses of Vector Space  The same interdocument similarity information captured in the X = }JT matrix can be used for other purposes, too. For example, Section 7.5.1 will discuss one approach to the problem of classifying documents known as nearest neighbor.  The Index captures patterns of keyword usage across a corpus of documents. The preceding sections have held the corpus constant and used this data to analyze transformations of the keyword dimensions, but the converse is also possible. For example, Section 6.3 will discuss the representation of interkeyword relationships known as thesauri. One simple baseline for keywords is their pairwise similarities, as captured by /:  Y = JTJ                                      (5.20) MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS       159  This produces a. V xV symmetric, square matrix capturing all (2) interkeyword similarities, exactly analogous to the interdocument similarities of Equation 5.15.  Littman has also considered an interesting application of LSI to the problem of searching across multilingual corpora [Littman et al., 1998].
