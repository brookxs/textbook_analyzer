When indexing text, the elements used as the basis of indexing include characters, word stems, words, and phrases. However, when dealing with imagery, audio, or video, we must utilize techniques that process different elements. In audio, this might mean phonemes (or basic units of sound) and their properties (e.g., loudness, pitch), in imagery this might include principle components such as color, shape, texture, and location, and in video this might include camera position and movement in addition to imagery and audio elements.  Definition: Multimedia information retrieval is the process of satisfying a user's stated information need by identifying all relevant text, graphics, audio (speech and non-speech audio), imagery, or video documents or portions of documents from a document collection.  With approximately 10 million sites on the World Wide Web, increasingly users are demanding content-based access to materials. This is evident by the advent of  question answering services (e.g., www.ask.com) as well as the success of spoken 242                                                                                              Chapter 10  language                understanding                (e.g.,                www.sls.lcs.mit.edu/sls,  www.ibm.com/software/speech, www.speech.sri.com, www.nuance.com, cslu.cse.ogi.edu) and tools to support content-based access to speech (e.g., www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/speech). In addition, innovations are appearing in the areas of content-based access to non-speech audio (e.g., www.musclefish.com), imagery (www.qbic.almaden.ibm.com) and video (e.g., www.virage.com, www.broadcast.com, www.necn.com). A separated but related body of research addresses the use of multimedia and intelligent processing to enhance the human computer interface (Maybury and Wahlster 1998). Other research focuses on the automation of the extraction, transformation (to another media), and summarization of media content, however, here we focus primarily on retrieval.  In the remainder of this chapter we discuss retrieval of a range of classes of media including spoken language, non-speech audio, graphics, imagery, and video, the latter of which depends upon processing of the previous media types. We illustrate information access for each of these media types by describing specific systems in order to give the reader a concrete sense of the nature and capabilities of current systems in these areas.
