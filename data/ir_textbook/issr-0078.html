 5.2.2.6 Problems With the Vector Model  In addition to the general problem of dynamically changing databases and the effect on weighting factors, there are problems with the vector model on assignment of a weight for a particular processing token to an item. Each processing token can be viewed as a new semantic topic. A major problem comes in the vector model when there are multiple topics being discussed in a particular item. For example, assume that an item has an in-depth discussion of "oil" in "Mexico" and also "coal" in "Pennsylvania." The vector model does not have a mechanism to associate each energy source with its particular geographic area. There is no way to associate correlation factors between terms (i.e., precoordination discussed in Chapter 3) since each dimension in a vector is independent of the other dimensions. Thus the item results in a high value in a search for 4"coal in Mexico." 122  Chapter 5  Another major limitation of a vector space is in associating positional information with a processing term. The concept of proximity searching (e.g., term "a" within 10 words of term "b") requires the logical structure to contain storage of positional information of a processing term. The concept of a vector space allows only one scalar value to be associated with each processing term for each item. Restricting searches to subsets of an item has been shown to provide increased precision (see Chapter 7). In effect this capability overcomes the multitopical item problem by looking at subsets of an item and thus increasing the probability that the subset is discussing a particular semantic topic.
