 13.8.2    Dynamic Search and Software Agents Dynamic search in the Web is equivalent to sequential text searching. The idea is to use an online search to discover relevant information by following links. The main advantage is that you are searching in the current structure of the Web, and not in what is stored in the index of a search engine. While this approach is slow for the entire Web, it might be used in small and dynamic subsets of the Web. The first heuristic devised was the fish search [113], which exploits the intuition that relevant documents often have neighbors that are relevant. Hence, the search is guided by following links in relevant documents. This was improved by shark search [366], which does a better relevance assessment of neighboring pages. This algorithm has been embedded in Mapuccino (see section 13.5.3), and Figure 10.22 shows a Web subset generated by this type of search. The main idea of these algorithms is to follow links in some priority, starting from a single page and a given query. At each step, the page with highest priority is analyzed. If it is found to be relevant, a heuristic decides to follow or not to follow the links on that page. If so, new pages are added to the priority list in the appropriate positions. Related work includes software agents for searching specific information on the Web [602, 477]. This implies dealing with heterogeneous sources of information which have to be combined. Important issues in this case are how to determine relevant sources (see also Chapters 9 and 15, as well as section 10.4.4) and and how to merge the results retrieved (the fusion problem). Examples are shopping robots such as Jango [401], Junglee [180], and Express [241].
