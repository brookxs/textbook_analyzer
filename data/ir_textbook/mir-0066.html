 3.5    Bibliographic Discussion A nice chapter on retrieval performance evaluation appeared in the book by Salton and McGill [698]. Even if outdated, it is still interesting reading. The book by Khorfage [451] also includes a full chapter on retrieval evaluation.  A recent paper by Mizzaro [569] presents a very complete survey of relevance studies throughout the years. About 160 papers are discussed in this paper. Two recent papers by Shaw, Burgin, and Howel [422, 423] discuss standards and evaluations in test collections for cluster-based and vector-based retrieval models. These papers also discuss the advantages of the harmonic mean (of recall and precision) as a single alternative measure for recall and precision. Problems with recall and precision related to systems which require a weak document ordering are discussed by Raghavan, Bollmann, and Jung [664, 663]. Tague-Sutcliffe proposes a measure of iiiformativeiiess for evaluating interactive user sessions [754]. BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        97 Our discussion of the TREC collection is based on the papers by Har-man [342] and by Vorhees and Harman [794]. The TREC collection is the most important reference collection nowadays for evaluation of complex information requests which execute on a large collection. Our coverage of the CACM and ISI collections is based on the work by Fox [272]. These collections are small, require short setup time, and provide a good environment for testing retrieval algorithms which are based on information derived from cross-citing patterns รณ a topic which has attracted much attention in the past [94, 435, 694, 730, 732, 809] and which might nourish again in the context of the Web. The discussion on the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) collection is based on the work by Shaw, Wood, Wood, and Tibbo [721]. The CF collection is also small but includes a set of relevance scores carefully generated by human experts. Furthermore, its example information requests present overlap among themselves which allows the testing of retrieval algorithms that take advantage of past user sessions to improve retrieval performance.
