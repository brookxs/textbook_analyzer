 4.2.3    Boolean Queries The oldest (and still heavily used) form of combining keyword queries is to use Boolean operators.   A Boolean query   has a syntax composed of atoms (i.e., basic queries) that retrieve documents, and of Boolean operators which work on their operands (which are sets of documents) and deliver sets of documents. Since this scheme is in general compositional (i.e., operators can be composed over the results of other operators), a query syntax tree is naturally defined, where the leaves correspond to the basic queries and the internal nodes to the operators. The query syntax tree operates on an algebra over sets of documents (and the final answer of the query is also a set of documents). This is much as, for instance, the syntax trees of arithmetic expressions where the numbers and variables are the leaves and the operations form the internal nodes. Figure 4.1 shows an example. The operators most commonly used, given two basic queries or Boolean KEYWORD-BASED QUERYING         103 subexpressions t\ and e2, are: © OR The query (ei OR 62) selects all documents which satisfy ei or 62-Duplicates are eliminated. Æ AND The query (ei AND e2) selects all documents which satisfy both e\ and e2Æ BUT The query (ei BUT e2) selects all documents which satisfy e\ but not e2. Notice that classical Boolean logic uses a NOT operation, where (NOT e2) is valid whenever 62 is not. In this case all documents not satisfying e2 should be delivered, which may retrieve a huge amount of text and is probably not what the user wants. The BUT operator, instead, restricts the universe of retrievable elements to the result of e\.\ Besides selecting the appropriate documents, the IR system may also sort the documents by some criterion, highlight the occurrences within the documents of the words mentioned in the query, and allow feedback by taking the answer set as a basis to reformulate the query. With classic Boolean systems, no ranking of the retrieved documents is normally provided. A document either satisfies the Boolean query (in which case it is retrieved) or it does not (in which case it is not retrieved). This is quite a limitation because it does not allow for partial matching between a document and a user query. To overcome this limitation, the condition for retrieval must be relaxed. For instance, a document which partially satisfies an AND condition might be retrieved. In fact, it is widely accepted that users not trained in mathematics find the meaning of Boolean operators difficult to grasp. With this problem in mind, a Lfuzzy Boolean1 set of operators has been proposed. The idea is that the meaning of AND and OR can be relaxed, such that instead of forcing an element to appear in all the operands (AND) or at least in one of the operands (OR), they retrieve elements appearing in some operands (the AND may require it to appear in more operands than the OR). Moreover, the documents are ranked higher when they have a larger number of elements in common with the query (see Chapter 2).
