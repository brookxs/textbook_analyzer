 7.6 Searching the INTERNET and Hypertext  The Internet has multiple different mechanisms that are the basis for search of items. The primary techniques are associated with servers on the Internet that create indexes of items on the Internet and allow search of them. Some of the most commonly used nodes are YAHOO, AltaVista and Lycos. In all of these systems there are active processes that visit a large number of Internet sites and retrieve textual data which they index. The primary design decisions are on the level to which they retrieve data and their general philosophy on user access. LYCOS (http://www.lycos.com) and AltaVista automatically go out to other Internet sites and return the text at the sites for automatic indexing (http://www.altavista.digital.com). Lycos returns home pages from each site for automatic indexing while Altavista indexes all of the text at a site. The retrieved text is then used to create an index to the source items storing the Universal Resource Locator (URL) to provide to the user to retrieve an item. All of the systems use some form of ranking algorithm to assist in display of the retrieved items. The algorithm is kept relatively simple using statistical information on the occurrence of words within the retrieved text.  Closely associated with the creation of the indexes is the technique for accessing nodes on the Internet to locate text to be indexed. This search process is also directly available to users via Intelligent Agents. Intelligent Agents provide the capability for a user to specify an information need which will be used by the Intelligent Agent as it independently. moves between Internet sites locating information of interest. There are six key characteristics of intelligent agents (Heilmann-96):  1.     Autonomy -    the search agent must be able to operate without interaction with a human agent.    It must have control over its own internal states and make independent decisions.   This implies a search capability to traverse information sites based upon pre-established criteria collecting potentially relevant information.  2.   Communications Ability - the agent must be able to communicate with the information sites as it traverses them.    This implies a universally accepted language defining the external interfaces (e.g., Z39.50). 192                                                                                               Chapter 7  3.   Capacity for Cooperation - this concept suggests that intelligent agents need to cooperate to perform mutually beneficial tasks.  4.   Capacity for Reasoning - There are three types of reasoning scenarios (Roseler-94):  Rule-based - where user has defined a set of conditions and actions to be taken  Knowledge-based - where the intelligent agents have stored previous conditions and actions taken which are used to deduce future actions  Artificial evolution based - where intelligent agents spawn new agents with higher logic capability to perform its objectives.  5.   Adaptive Behavior - closely tied to 1 and 4 , adaptive behavior permits the intelligent agent to assess its current state and make decisions on the actions it should take  6.   Trustworthiness - the user must trust that the intelligent agent will act on the user's behalf to locate information that the user has access to and is relevant to the user.  There are many implementation aspects of Intelligent Agents. They include communications to traverse the Internet, how to wrap the agent in an appropriate interface shell to work within an Internet server, and security and protection for both the agent and the servers. Although these are critical for the implementation of the agents, the major focus for information storage and retrieval is how to optimize the location of relevant items as the agent performs its task. This requires expansion of search capabilities into conditional and learning feedback mechanisms that are becoming major topics in information retrieval.  Automatic relevance feedback is being used in a two-step process to enhance user's queries to include corpora-specific terminology. As an intelligent agent moves from site to site, it is necessary for it to use similar techniques to learn the language of the authors and correlate it to the search need of the user. How much information gained from relevance feedback from one site should be carried to the next site has yet to be resolved. Some basic groundwork is being laid by the work on incremental relevance feedback discussed earlier. It will also need capabilities to normalize ranking values across multiple systems. The quantity of possible information being returned necessitates a merged ranking to allow the user to focus on the most likely relevant items first.  Finally, there is the process of searching for information on the Internet by following Hyperlinks. A Hyperlink is an embedded link to another item that can be instantiated by clicking on the item reference. Frequently hidden to the user User Search Techniques                                                                            193  is a URL associated with the text being displayed. As discussed in Chapter 5, inserting hyperlinks in an item is a method of indexing related information. One of the issues of the existing Hyperlink process is the inability for the link to have attributes. In particular, a link may be a pointer to another object that is an integral aspect of the item being displayed (e.g. an embedded image or quoted text in another item). But the reference could also be to another item that generally supports the current text. It could also be to another related topic that the author feels may be of interest to the reader. There are many other interpretations of the rationale behind the link that are author specific.  Understanding the context of the link in the item being viewed determines the utility of following the associated path. Thus the Hyperlinks create a static network of linked items based upon an item being viewed. The user can manually move through this network space by following links. The search in this sense is the ability to start with an item and create the network of associated items (i.e., following the links). The results of the search is a network diagram that defines the interrelated items which can be displayed to the user to assist in identification of where the user is in the network and to facilitate movement to other nodes (items) within the network (Gershon-95, Hasan-95, Mukherjea-95, Munzner-95). The information retrieval aspect of this problem is how to automatically follow the hyperlinks and how the additional information as each link is instantiated impacts the resolution of the user's search need. One approach is to use the function described in Section 5.5 as a mechanism for assigning weights to the terms in original and linked items to use with the search statement to determine hits.  New search capabilities are continually becoming available on the Internet. Dissemination systems are proliferating to provide individual users with items they are potentially interested in for personal or business reasons. Some examples are the PointCast system, Fish Wrap newspaper service at MIT and SFGATE (San Francisco Examiner and San Francisco Chronicle) that allow users to define specific areas of interest. Items will be e-mailed as found or stored in a file for later retrieval. The systems will continually update your screen if you are on the Internet with new items as they are found (http://fishwrapdocs.www.media.mit.edu/docs/, http:/www.sfgate.com, http:/www.pointcast.com). There are also many search sites that collect relevance information from user interaction and use relevance feedback algorithms and proprietary heuristics and provide modifications on information being delivered. Firefly interacts with a user, learning the user's preferences for record albums and movies. It provides recommendations on potential products of interest. The Firefly system also compares the user's continually changing interest profile with other users and informs users of others with similar interests for possible collaboration (http:/www.ffly.com). Another system that uses feedback across multiple users to categorize and classify interests is the Empirical Media system (http:/www.empiracal.com). Based upon an Individual user's relevance ranking of what is being displayed the system learns a user's preference. It also judges from other user's rankings of items the likelihood that an item will be of interest to other 194                                                                                               Chapter 7  users that show the same pattern of interest. Thus it uses this "Collaborative Intelligence" in addition to its internal ranking algorithms to provide a final ranking of items to individual users. Early research attempts at using queries across multiple users to classify document systems did not show much promise (Salton-83). But the orders of magnitude increase (million times greater or more) in user interaction from the Internet provides a basis for realistic clustering and learning.
