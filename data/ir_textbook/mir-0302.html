 15.5.2    Usability Key to the success of digital library projects is having usable systems. This is a serious challenge! Simple library catalog systems were observed in 1986 to be difficult to use [104], and still remain so after a further decade of research and development [105]. The above mentioned ENVISION project's title began with the expression 'User-Centered' and concentrated most of its resources on work with the interface [360]. A 1997 study at Virginia Tech of four digital library systems concluded that many have serious usability problems [434], though the design of the Illinois digital libraryI system seemed promising. The Virginia Tech study uncovered an important aspect of the situation, and suggested that it will be years before digital library systems are properly understood and used. A pre-test asked about user expectations for a digital library, and found that very few had worked with a digital library. The post-test showed that user expectations and priorities for various features changed dramatically over the short test period. Thus, it is likely that in general, as digital library usage spreads, there will be an increase in understanding, a shift in what capabilities users expect, and a variety of extensions to the interfaces now considered. Early in the digital libraryI work, digital library use was perceived as a research focus [98], and understanding and assessing user needs became a key concern [382]. For two years, a workshop was held at the Allerton conference center of the University of Illinois on this topic. Since the 1995 event [313] had a diverse group of researchers, it was necessary to understand the various perspectives and terminologies. There were discussions of fundamental issues, such as information, from a human factors perspective [214], as well as specific explorations of tasks like document browsing [528]. The 1996 event was more focused due to greater progress in building and studying usability of digital librarys [314]. Thus, there was discussion of Stanford's Sense-Maker system which supports rapid shifting between contexts that reflect stages of user exploration [51]. Social concerns that broaden the traditional IR perspective were highlighted [367]. In addition, there was movement towards metrics (see discussion earlier about digital library metrics) and factors for adopting digital librarys [429]. digital library interfaces and usability concerns have been central to many efforts at Xerox PARC. Some of the research considers social issues related to documents [354] while other research bridges the gap between paper and digital documents [353]. There are many issues about documents, especially their stability and how multimedia components as well as active elements affect retrieval, preservation, and other digital library activities [506]. Some insight into digital library use may result from actual user observation as well as other measures of what (parts of) documents are read [507]. There also has been collaboration between PARC and the UCB digital libraryI team, which has extended the Xerox magic filter work into multivalent documents (discussed earlier) as well as having developed results visualization methods like STANDARDS        429 TileBars where it is easy to spot the location of term matches in long documents [355]. Further work is clearly needed in digital library projects to improve the systems and their usability. But for these systems to work together, there also must be some emphasis on standards.
