 1.3.2 Selective Dissemination of Information  The Selective Dissemination of Information (Mail) Process (see Figure 1.4) provides the capability to dynamically compare newly received items in the information system against standing statements of interest of users and deliver the Introduction to Information Retrieval Systems                                              17  item to those users whose statement of interest matches the contents of the item. The Mail process is composed of the search process, user statements of interest (Profiles) and user mail files. As each item is received, it is processed against every user's profile. A profile contains a typically broad search statement along with a list of user mail files that will receive the document if the search statement in the profile is satisfied. User search profiles are different than ad hoc queries in that they contain significantly more search terms (10 to 100 times more terms) and cover a wider range of interests. These profiles define all the areas in which a user is interested versus an ad hoc query which is frequently focused to answer a specific question. It has been shown in recent studies that automatically expanded user profiles perform significantly better than human generated profiles (Harman95).  When the search statement is satisfied, the item is placed in the Mail File(s) associated with the profile. Items in Mail files are typically viewed in time of receipt order and automatically deleted after a specified time period (e.g., after one month) or upon command from the user during display. The dynamic asynchronous updating of Mail Files makes it difficult to present the results of dissemination in estimated order of likelihood of relevance to the user (ranked order). This is discussed in Chapter 2.  Very little research has focused exclusively on the Mail Dissemination process. Most systems modify the algorithms they have established for retrospective search of document (item) databases to apply to Mail Profiles. Dissemination differs from the ad hoc search process in that thousands of user profiles are processed against one item versus the inverse and there is not a large relatively static database of items to be used in development of relevance ranking weights for an item.  Both implementers and researchers have treated the dissemination process as independent from the rest of the information system. The general assumption has been that the only knowledge available in making decisions on whether an incoming item is of interest is the user's profile and the incoming item. This restricted view has produced suboptimal systems forcing the user to receive redundant information that has little value. If a total Information Retrieval System view is taken, then the existing Mail and Index files are also potentially available during the dissemination process. This would allow the dissemination profile to be expanded to include logic against existing files. For example, assume an index file (discussed below) exists that has the price of oil from Mexico as a value in a field with a current value of $30. An analyst will be less interested in items that discuss Mexico and $30 oil prices then items that discuss Mexico and prices other than $30 (i.e., looking for changes). Similarly, if a Mail file already has many items on a particular topic, it would be useful for a profile to not disseminate additional items on the same topic, or at least reduce the relative importance that the system assigns to them (i.e., the rank value).  Selective Dissemination of Information has not yet been applied to multimedia sources.   In some cases where the audio is transformed into text, existing 18                                                                                                Chapter 1  textual algorithms have been applied to the transcribed text (e.g., the DARPA's TIDES Portal), but little research has gone into dissemination techniques for multimedia sources.
