 Serial search  Although serial searches are acknowledge to be slow, they are frequently still used as parts of larger systems. They also provide a convenient demonstration of the use of matching functions.  Suppose there are N documents Di in the system, then the serial search proceeds by calculating N values M(Q, Di) the set of documents to be retrieved is determined. There are two ways of doing this:  (1) the matching function is given a suitable threshold, retrieving the documents above the threshold and discarding the ones below. If T is the threshold, then the retrieved set B is the set {Di |M(Q, Di) gt; T}.  (2) the documents are ranked in increasing order of matching function value. A rank position R is chosen as cut-off and all documents below the rank are retrieved so that B = {Di |r(i) lt; R} where r(i) is the rank position assigned to Di. The hope in each case is that the relevant documents are contained in the retrieved set.  The main difficulty with this kind of search strategy is the specification of the threshold or cut-off. It will always be arbitrary since there is no way of telling in advance what value for each query will produce the best retrieval.
