 13.2    Challenges We now mention the main problems posed by the Web. We can divide them in two classes: problems with the data itself and problems regarding the user and his interaction with the retrieval system. The problems related to the data are: Æ Distributed data: due to the intrinsic nature of the Web, data spans over many computers and platforms. These computers are interconnected with no predefined topology and the available bandwidth and reliability on the network interconnections varies widely. ï  High percentage of volatile data: due to Internet dynamics, new computers and data can be added or removed easily (it is estimated that 40% of the Web changes every month [424]). We also have dangling links and relocation problems when domain or file names change or disappear. ï  Large volume: the exponential growth of the Web poses scaling issues that are difficult to cope with. ï  Unstructured and redundant data: most people say that the Web is a distributed hypertext.  However, this is not exactly so.  Any hypertext has a conceptual model behind it, which organizes and adds consistency to the data and the hyperlinks. That is hardly true in the Web, even for individual documents. In addition, each HTML page is not well structured and some people use the term semi-structured data. Moreover, much Web data is repeated (mirrored or copied) or very similar. Approximately 30% of Web pages are (near) duplicates [120, 723].  Semantic redundancy can be even larger. ï  Quality of data: the Web can be considered as a new publishing medium. However, there is, in most cases, no editorial process. So, data can be false, invalid (for example, because it is too old), poorly written or, typically, with many errors from different sources (typos, grammatical mistakes, OCR errors, etc.). Preliminary studies show that the number of words with typos can range from 1 in 200 for common words to 1 in 3 for foreign surnames [588;. CHARACTERIZING THE WEB        369 Æ Heterogeneous data: in addition to having to deal with multiple media types and hence with multiple formats, we also have different languages and, what is worse, different alphabets, some of them very large (for example, Chinese or Japanese Kanji). Most of these problems (such as the variety of data types and poor data quality) are not solvable simply by software improvements. In fact, many of them will not change (and they should not, as in the case of language diversity!) because they are problems (also features) intrinsic to human nature. The second class of problems are those faced by the user during the interaction with the retrieval system. There are basically two problems: (1) how to specify a query and (2) how to interpret the answer provided by the system. Without taking into account the semantic content of a document, it is not easy to precisely specify a query, unless it is very simple. Further, even if the user is able to pose the query, the answer might be a thousand Web pages. How do we handle a large answer? How do we rank the documents? How do we select the documents that really are of interest to the user? In addition, a single document could be large. How do we browse efficiently in large documents? So, the overall challenge, in spite of the intrinsic problems posed by the Web, is to submit a good query to the search system, and obtain a manageable and relevant answer. Moreover, in practice we should try to achieve the latter goal even for poorly formulated queries. In the rest of this chapter, we use the term Web pages for HTML documents (HTML is described in Chapter 6). To denote all possible data types available on the Web, we use the term Web documents.
