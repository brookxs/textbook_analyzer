 8 Information Visualization  8.1     Introduction to Information Visualization  8.2    Cognitive and Perception  8.3    Information Visualization Technologies  8.4    Summary  The primary focus on Information Retrieval Systems has been in the areas of indexing, searching and clustering versus information display. This has been due to the inability of technology to provide the technical platforms needed for sophisticated display, academic's focusing on the more interesting algorithmic based search aspects of information retrieval, and the multi-disciplinary nature of the hum an-computer interface (HCI). The core technologies needed to address sophisticated information visualization have matured, supporting productive research and implementation into commercial products. The commercial demand for these technologies is growing with availability of the "information highway." System designers need to treat the display of data as visual computing instead of treating the monitor as a replica of paper. Functions that are available with electronic display and visualization of data that were not previously provided are (Brown-96):  modify representations of data and information or the display condition  (e.g., changing color scales)  use the same representation while showing changes in data (e.g., moving between clusters of items showing new linkages)  animate the display to show changes in space and time  enable interactive input from the user to allow dynamic movement between information spaces and allow the user to modify data presentation to optimize personal preferences for understanding the data. 200                                                                                               Chapter 8  Create hyperlinks under user control to establish relationships between data  If information retrieval had achieved development of the perfect search algorithm providing close to one hundred per cent precision and recall, the need for advances in information visualization would not be so great. But reality has demonstrated in TREC and other information fora that advancements are not even close to achieving this goal. Thus, any technique that can reduce the user overhead of finding the needed information will supplement algorithmic achievements in finding potential relevant items. Information Visualization addresses how the results of a search may be optimally displayed to the users to facilitate their understanding of what the search has provided and their selection of most likely items of interest to read. Visual displays can consolidate the search results into a form easily processed by the user's cognitive abilities, but in general they do not answer the specific retrieval needs of the user other than suggesting database coverage of the concept and related concepts.  The theoretical disciplines of cognitive engineering and perception provide a theoretical base for information visualization. Cognitive engineering derives design principles for visualization techniques from what we know about the neural processes involved with attention, memory, imagery and information processing of the human visual system. By 1989 research had determined that mental depiction plays a role in cognition that is different from mental description. Thus, the visual representation of an item plays as important a role as its symbolic definition in cognition.  Cognitive engineering results can be applied to methods of reviewing the concepts contained in items selected by search of an information system. Visualization can be divided into two broad classes: link visualization and attribute (concept) visualization. Link visualization displays relationships among items. Attribute visualization reveals content relationships across large numbers of items. Related to attribute visualization is the capability to provide visual cues on how search terms affected the search results. This assists a user in determining changes required to search statements that will return more relevant items.
