 2.3    Retrieval: Ad hoc and Filtering In a conventional information retrieval system, the documents in the collection remain relatively static while new queries are submitted to the system. This operational mode has been termed ad hoc retrieval in recent years and is the 22        MODELING most common form of user task. A similar but distinct task is one in which the queries remain relatively static while new documents come into the system (and leave). For instance, this is the case with the stock market and with news wiring services. This operational mode has been termed filtering. In a filtering task [74], a user profile describing the user's preferences is constructed. Such a profile is then compared to the incoming documents in an attempt to determine those which might be of interest to this particular user. For instance, this approach can be used to select a news article among thousands of articles which are broadcast each day. Other potential scenarios for the application of filtering include the selection of preferred judicial decisions, or the selection of articles from daily newspapers, etc. Typically, the filtering task simply indicates to the user the documents which might be of interest to him. The task of determining which ones are really relevant is fully reserved to the user. Not even a ranking of the filtered documents is provided. A variation of this procedure is to rank the filtered documents and show this ranking to the user. The motivation is that the user can examine a smaller number of documents if he assumes that the ones at the top of this ranking are more likely to be relevant. This variation of filtering is called routing (see Chapter 3) but it is not popular. Even if no ranking is presented to the user, the filtering task can compute an internal ranking to determine potentially relevant documents. For instance, documents with a ranking above a given threshold could be selected; the others would be discarded. Any IR model can be adopted to rank the documents, but the vector model is usually preferred due to its simplicity. At this point, we observe that filtering is really a type of user task (or operational mode) and not a model of information retrieval. Thus, the task of filtering and the IR model adopted are orthogonal aspects of an IR system. In a filtering task, the crucial step is not the ranking itself but the construction of a user profile which truly reflects the user's preferences. Many approaches for constructing user profiles have been proposed and here we briefly discuss a couple of them. A simplistic approach for constructing a user profile is to describe the profile through a set of keywords and to require the user to provide the necessary keywords. The approach is simplistic because it requires the user to do too much. In fact, if the user is not familiar with the service which generates the upcoming documents, he might find it fairly difficult to provide the keywords which appropriately describe his preferences in that context. Furthermore, an attempt by the user to familiarize himself with the vocabulary of the upcoming documents might turn into a tedious and time consuming exercise. Thus, despite its feasibility, requiring the user to precisely describe his profile might be impractical. A more elaborate alternative is to collect information from the user about his preferences and to use this information to build the user profile dynamically. This can be accomplished as follows. In the very beginning, the user provides a set of keywords which describe an initial (and primitive) profile of his preferences. As new documents arrive, the system uses this profile to select documents which are potentially of interest and A FORMAL CHARACTERIZATION OF IR MODELS        23 shows them to the user. The user then goes through a relevance feedback cycle (see Chapter 5) in which he indicates not only the documents which are really relevant but also the documents which are non-relevant. The system uses this information to adjust the user profile description such that it reflects the new preferences just declared. Of course, with this procedure the profile is continually changing. Hopefully, however, it stabilizes after a while and no longer changes drastically (unless, of course, the user's interests shift suddenly). Chapter 5 illustrates mechanisms which can be used to dynamically update a keyword-based profile. Prom the above, it should be clear that the filtering task can be viewed as a conventional information retrieval task in which the documents are the ones which keep arriving at the system. Ranking can be computed as before. The difficulty with filtering resides in describing appropriately the user's preferences in a user profile. The most common approaches for deriving a user profile are based on collecting relevant information from the user, deriving preferences from this information, and modifying the user profile accordingly. Since the number of potential applications of filtering keeps increasing, we should see in the future a renewed interest in the study and usage of the technique.
