 2.8.1    Bayesian Networks Bayesian networks [630] are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in which the nodes represent random variables, the arcs portray causal relationships between these ALTERNATIVE PROBABILISTIC MODELS 49 variables, and the strengths of these causal influences are expressed by conditional probabilities. The parents of a node (which is then considered as a child node) are those judged to be direct causes for it. This causal relationship is represented in the DAG by a link directed from each parent node to the child node. The roots of the network are the nodes without parents. Let Xi be a node in a Bayesian network G and Tx% be the set of parent nodes of #$. The influence of Yx% on Xi can be specified by any set of functions Fi(xi,FXl) that satisfy lt;, rSl)   = o  lt;  Fi(xurXt)   lt;   i where X{ also refers to the states of the random variable associated to the node This specification is complete and consistent because the product Y[ii Fi(xi,Tx constitutes a joint probability distribution for the nodes in G. Figure 2.8    An example of a Bayesian network. Figure 2.8 illustrates a Bayesian network for a joint probability distribution P(xi,X2,X3,X4,x5). In this case, the dependencies declared in the network allow the natural expression of the joint probability distribution in terms of local conditional probabilities (a key advantage of Bayesian networks) as follows. The probability P(#i) is called the prior probability for the network and can be used to model previous knowledge about the semantics of the application.
