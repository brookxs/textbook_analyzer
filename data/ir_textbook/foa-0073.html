 4.3.6 Normalized Recall and Precision  The best/worst "envelope" surrounding an actual Re/Pre curve is related to a similar comparison known as normalized recall [Rocchio, 1966]. Imagine plotting the fraction of relevant documents retrieved as a function of the fraction of the total number of documents retrieved. Such a function is plotted in Figure 4.13. Comparing the area between the actual retrieval and the worst case (shaded) to the total area between the ASSESSING THE RETRIEVAL       129  1.0  NRel  Recall  NRel                rj                                               NDoc          Rank  FIGURE 4.13 Normalized Recall  best (hashed) and worst cases (that above the region) is very much like the best/worst-case envelope of Figure 4.12.  We can derive expressions for this area. Let r j be the hitlist rank of the fth relevant document. Then the area under the curve corresponding to any actual query is (if we define ro = 0):  NRel  Actual =  NRel  (4.7)  In the best case r; Best =  i:  NRel+l  NRel              NRel^'             2  when NRel ógt; oo.
