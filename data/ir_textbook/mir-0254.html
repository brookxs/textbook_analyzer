 13.4.1    Centralized Architecture Most search engines use a centralized crawler-indexer architecture. Crawlers are programs (software agents) that traverse the Web sending new or updated pages to a main server where they are indexed. Crawlers are also called robots, spiders, wanderers, walkers, and knowbots.   In spite of their name, a crawler does not actually move to and run on remote machines, rather the crawler runs on a local system and sends requests to remote Web servers. The index is used in a centralized fashion to answer queries submitted from different places in the Web. Figure 13.3 shows the software architecture of a search engine based on the AltaVista architecture [17]. It has two parts: one that deals with the users, 374        SEARCHING THE WEB Query Engine   Interface  Users Crawler Indexer Web Figure 13.3    Typical crawler-indexer architecture. consisting of the user interface and the query engine and another that consists of the crawler and indexer modules. In 1998, the overall AltaVista system was running on 20 multi-processor machines, all of them having more than 130 Gb of RAM and over 500 Gb of disk space. Only the query engine uses more than 75% of these resources. The main problem faced by this architecture is the gathering of the data, because of the highly dynamic nature of the Web, the saturated communication links, and the high load at Web servers. Another important problem is the volume of the data. In fact, the crawler-indexer architecture may not be able to cope with Web growth in the near future. Particularly important is good load balancing between the different activities of a search engine, internally (answering queries and indexing) and externally (crawling). The largest search engines, considering Web coverage in June 1998, were AltaVista [17], HotBot [380], Northern Light [608], and Excite [240], in that order. According to recent studies, these engines cover 28-55% [749] or 14-34% [490] of all Web pages, whose number was estimated at over 300 million in 1998. Table 13.2 lists the most important search engines and their estimated sizes along with their corresponding URLs. Beware that some search engines are powered by the same internal engine. For example, HotBot, GoTo, and Microsoft are powered by Inktomi [395] and Magellan by Exciters internal engine. Up to date information can be found in [749, 609]. Most search engines are based in the United States and focus on documents in English. Nevertheless, there are search engines specialized in different countries and/or languages, which are able, for instance, to query and retrieve documents written in Kanji (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean). Also there are search engines that take other approaches, like Ask Jeeves! which simulates an interview [34] or DirectHit [215] which ranks the Web pages in the answer in order of their popularity. We should also mention those search engines aimed at specific topics, for example the Search Broker [537] which allows us to search in many specific topics and DejaNews [212] which searches the USENET archives.

There are also engines to retrieve specific Web pages such as personal or institutional home pages or specific objects such as electronic mail addresses, images, or software applets.
