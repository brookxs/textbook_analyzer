 288      FINDING OUT ABOUT  7.7.2 Adapting to Fluid Language Use  The advantages of my benefiting from your experience training a system are obvious. Just as obvious, though, are ways in which you and I might differ in our notions of relevant documents. Even this comparison is only possible if we each evaluate exactly the same query, and how often will that happen?!  If we are to change our representations of documents based on users' opinions, should we value "expert" opinions over those of "novices"? Common sense would suggest that if we could ascertain that one user was indeed expert in a particular topical area, then their assessments of relevance should perhaps carry more weight. But based at least on the experience of lawyers searching case law [Cohen, 1991; Sprowl, 1976] experts are less likely to search in their own area of expertise, probably because they already know what they will find there. The typical user searches in areas they know less about. In that respect, perhaps the novice's relevance feedback is, in fact, a better characterization of what we should attempt to satisfy.  Once the index representation is allowed to change in response to users' relevance feedback we are faced with the question of how fast this change should occur. Some of these questions were mentioned in terms of conceptual drift by users and topic tracking in news sources (cf. Section 7.3.2). Adopting the longer-term archival perspective of a librarian perhaps, how quickly should we want our adaptive system to track current trendy terms? (cf. Wired magazine's Tired/Wired Memes4 feature). When old terms of art have been rendered obsolete, how can we nevertheless maintain an archival record of this previous ethology         terminology?*^"
