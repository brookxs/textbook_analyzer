  6.5.1 Theorem-Proving Models for Relevance  Imagine the current state of knowledge possessed by a browsing user as a set of axioms E. Then we can model their information need as a question: Can we infer that a theorem r is true or false from our current knowledge?  ?  E \= x                                       (6.12) INFERENCE BEYOND THE INDEX      225  The fact that the user has an information need can be taken as an assumption that there must be additional knowledge, contained in some documents, that together with his of her current knowledge base does allow r (or ~i r) to be proven. Relevant documents are exactly those that support such an inference:  Rel = {d\HU d |=t}                          (6.13)  Practically speaking, of course, this model is impossible. It would demand a complete and consistent logical description of the user's cognitive state. It also requires that the full set ofall possible logical facts contained in each and every document be similarly encoded. (And then, of course, there is the minor problem of searching for the minimal set of documents that satisfy this inference!)^                                                                           Late Winograd  Still, this basic conception of existing knowledge being extended by new facts and new inferences becoming possible as new facts become known is a provocative metaphor at the least. Sperber and Wilson's notion of "connected" information corresponds exactly to such new inferences (cf. Section 8.2.2).  Van Rijsbergen has talked about this strong notion of relevance as objective relevance [van Rijsbergen, p. 147]. In more recent work, he has extended this basic model to a full relevance logic, based on a four-valued semantics over 2^T}F^ [van Rijsbergen, 1986].
