 A language for describing file structures  Like all subjects in computer science the terminology of file structures has evolved higgledy-piggledy without much concern for consistency, ambiguity, or whether it was possible to make the kind of distinctions that were important. It was only much later that the need for a well-defined, unambiguous language to describe file structures became apparent. In particular, there arose a need to communicate ideas about file structures without getting bogged down by hardware considerations.  This section will present a formal description of file structures. The framework described is important for the understanding of any file structure. The terminology is based on that introduced by Hsiao and Harary (but also see Hsiao[15] and Manola and Hsiao[16]). Their terminology has been modified and extended by Severance[17], a summary of this can be found in van Rijsbergen[18]. Jonkers[19] has formalised a different framework which provides an interesting contrast to the one described here.
