 2.5.3 Software Libraries  As much as possible, we will depend on standard libraries for some of our basic utilities. In particular, it is recommended that you use:  誰  gethash - This is the standard hashtable routine, part of most Unix distributions.  誰  stopper - Chris Fox's lexical analyzer, also incorporating stopword removal. This code accompanies Fox's chapter, "Lexical Analysis and Stoplists" [Fox, 1992].  誰  splay - Splay trees provided many of the benefits of balanced binary trees without many of the hassles of perfectly balanced (e.g., AVL) trees [Sleator and Tarjan, 1985]. This implementation was written by David Brower [Brower, 1994, chapter 10].  誰  stem-This is the "Porter" stemmer, a pattern-matching affixremoval stemmer [Porter, 1980].
