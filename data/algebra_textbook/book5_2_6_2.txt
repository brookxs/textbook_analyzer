Set-Builder Notation Mathematicians use a construct called set-builder notation to describe sets or collections of numbers. The general form of set-builder notation looks as follows: {x : some statement about x} For example, suppose that we want to describe the set of “all real numbers that are less than 2.” We could use the following notation: A = {x : x < 2} 2.6. INEQUALITIES 137 This is read aloud as follows: “A equals the set of all x such that x is less than 2.” Some prefer to use a vertical bar instead of a colon. A = {x|x < 2} In this text we use the colon in set-builder notation, but feel free to use the vertical bar instead. They mean the same thing. One might still object that the notation {x : x < 2} is a bit vague. One objection could be “What type of numbers x are you referring to? Do you want the integers that are less than two or do you want the real numbers that are less than two?” As you can see, this is a valid objection. One way of addressing this objection is to write: A = {x ∈ R : x < 2} or A = {x ∈ N : x < 2} The first is read “A is the set of all x in R that are less than two,” while the second is read “A is the set of all x in N that are less than two.” Set-builder Assumption. In this text, unless there is a specific refernce to the set of numbers desired, we will assume that the notation {x : x < 2} is asking for the set of all real numbers less than 2. In Figure 2.15, we’ve shaded the set of real numbers {x : x < 2}. Because −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Figure 2.15: Shading the numbers less than 2. “less than” is the same as saying “left of,” we’ve shaded (in red) all points on the real line that lie to the left of the number two. Note that there is an “empty circle” at the number two. The point representing the number two is not shaded because we were only asked to shade the numbers that are strictly less than two. While the shading in Figure 2.15 is perfectly valid, much of the information provided in Figure 2.15 is unnecessary (and perhaps distracting). We only need to label the endpoint and shade the real numbers to the left of two, as we’ve done in constructing Figure 2.16. 2 Figure 2.16: You only need to label the endpoint. For contrast, suppose instead that we’re asked to shade the set of real numbers {x : x ≤ 2}. This means that we must shade all the real numbers 138 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES 2 Figure 2.17: You only need to label the endpoint. that are “less than or equal to 2” or “left of and including 2.” The resulting set is shaded in Figure 2.17. Note the difference between Figures 2.16 and 2.17. In Figures 2.16 we’re shading the set {x : x < 2}, so the number 2 is left unshaded (an empty dot). In Figures 2.17, we’re shading the set {x : x ≤ 2}, so the number 2 is shaded (a filled-in dot). You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Shade the set {x : x ≥ −3} on the real line.Shade {x : x ≤ 4} on the real line. Solution: The notation {x : x ≥ −3} is pronounced “the set of all real numbers x such that x is greater than or equal to −3.” Thus, we need to shade the number −3 and all real numbers to the right of −3. −34 Answer: ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Use set-builder notation to describe the set of real numbersUse set-builder notation to describe the following set of real numbers: −10 that are shaded on the number line below. −1 Solution: The number −1 is not shaded. Only the numbers to the left of −1 are shaded. This is the set of all real numbers x such that x is “less than” −1. Thus, we describe this set with the following set-builder notation: {x : x < −1} . Answer: {x : x > −10} ! Set-Builder Notation Mathematicians use a construct called set-builder notation to describe sets or collections of numbers.
