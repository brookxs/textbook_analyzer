The Greatest Common Factor (GCF) Using the method we studied in Section 3.4, we could obtain the prime factoriza­tions of 30 and 42. 30 = 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 42 = 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 7 Common Factor We notice that 2 appears as a factor in both numbers, that is, 2 is a common factor of 30 and 42. We also notice that 3 appears as a factor in both numbers. Three is also a common factor of 30 and 42. Greatest Common Factor (GCF) When considering two or more numbers, it is often useful to know if there is a largest common factor of the numbers, and if so, what that number is. The largest common factor of two or more whole numbers is called the greatest common factor, and is abbreviated by GCF. The greatest common factor of a collection of whole numbers is useful in working with fractions (which we will do in Section 4.1).
