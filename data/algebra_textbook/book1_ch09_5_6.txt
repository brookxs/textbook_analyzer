Conjugates and Rationalizing the Denominator To perform a division that contains a binomial in the denominator, such as we multiply the numerator and denominator by a conjugate of the denominator. Conjugate A conjugate of the binomial a + b is a – b . Similarly, a conjugate of a – b is a + b . Notice that when the conjugates a + b and a – b are multiplied together, they produce a difference of two squares. ( a + b )( a – b ) = a 2 – a b + a b – b 2 = a 2 – b 2 This principle helps us eliminate square root radicals, as shown in these examples that illustrate finding the product of conjugates.
