Mathematical Properties of Addition The order in which we add integers does not matter. That is, −20 + 34 gives an answer identical to the sum 34 + (−20). In both cases, the answer is 14. This fact is called the commutative property of addition. The Commutative Property of Addition. If a and b are any two integers, then: a+ b = b+ a Next, when we add three integers, it does not matter which two we add first. For example, if we add the second and third of three numbers first, we get: −11 + (−2 + 5) = −11 + 3 Parentheses first: −2 + 5 = 3 = −8 Add: −11 + 3 = −8 1.1. AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INTEGERS 7 On the other hand, if we add the first and second of three numbers first, we get: (−11 + (−2)) + 5 = −13 + 5 Parentheses first: −11 + (−2) = −13 = −8 Add: −13 + 5 = −8 Thus, −11 + (−2 + 5) = (−11 + (−2)) + 5. This fact is called the associative property of addition. The Associative Property of Addition. If a, b, and c are any three integers, then: a+ (b+ c) = (a+ b) + c Mathematical Properties of Addition The order in which we add integers does not matter.
