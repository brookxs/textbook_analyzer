The Method of Adding and Subtracting Decimals When writing the previous addition, we could have written the numbers in col­umns. This agrees with our previous result. From this observation, we can suggest a method for adding and subtracting decimal numbers. Method of Adding and Subtracting Decimals To add or subtract decimals: Align the numbers vertically so that the decimal points line up under each other and the corresponding decimal positions are in the same column. Add or subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Place a decimal point in the resulting sum or difference directly under the other decimal points. Sample Set A Find the following sums and differences. Example 6.22.  9.813 + 2.140 Example 6.23.  841.0056 + 47.016 + 19.058 To insure that the columns align properly, we can write a 0 in the position at the end of the numbers 47.016 and 19.058 without changing their values. Example 6.24.  1.314 – 0.58 Example 6.25.  16.01 – 7.053 Example 6.26.  Find the sum of 6.88106 and 3.5219 and round it to three decimal places. We need to round the sum to the thousandths position. Since the digit in the position immediately to the right is 9, and 9>5, we get 10.403 Example 6.27.  Wendy has $643.12 in her checking account. She writes a check for $16.92. How much is her new account balance? To find the new account balance, we need to find the difference between 643.12 and 16.92. We will subtract 16.92 from 643.12. After writing a check for $16.92, Wendy now has a balance of $626.20 in her checking account. Practice Set A Find the following sums and differences. Exercise 6.5.1.
