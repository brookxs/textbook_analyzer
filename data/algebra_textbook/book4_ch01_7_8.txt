The Additive Identity 0 Is the Additive Identity The whole number 0 is called the additive identity, since when it is added to any whole number, the sum is identical to that whole number. Sample Set C Example 1.50.  Add the whole numbers. 29 + 0 = 29 0 + 29 = 29 Zero added to 29 does not change the identity of 29. Practice Set C Add the following whole numbers. Exercise 1.7.5. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.7.6. (Go to Solution) Suppose we let the letter x represent a choice for some whole number. For the first two problems, find the sums. For the third problem, find the sum provided we now know that x represents the whole number 17. Exercise 1.7.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.7.8. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.7.9.
