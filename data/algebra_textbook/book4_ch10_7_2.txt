Multiplication of Signed Numbers Let us consider first, the product of two positive numbers. Multiply: 3 ⋅ 5. 3 ⋅ 5 means 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 This suggests[1] that ( positive number ) ⋅ ( positive number ) = ( positive number ) More briefly, ( + ) ( + ) = ( + ) Now consider the product of a positive number and a negative number. Multiply: (3)( − 5). (3)( − 5) means ( − 5) + ( − 5) + ( − 5) = − 15 This suggests that ( positive number ) ⋅ ( negative number ) = ( negative number ) More briefly, ( + ) ( – ) = ( – ) By the commutative property of multiplication, we get ( negative number ) ⋅ ( positive number ) = ( negative number ) More briefly, ( − ) ( + ) = ( − ) The sign of the product of two negative numbers can be suggested after observing the following illustration. Multiply -2 by, respectively, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -4. We have the following rules for multiplying signed numbers. Rules for Multiplying Signed Numbers Multiplying signed numbers: To multiply two real numbers that have the same sign, multiply their absolute values. The product is positive. ( + ) ( + ) = ( + ) ( − ) ( − ) = ( + ) To multiply two real numbers that have opposite signs, multiply their abso­lute values. The product is negative. ( + ) ( − ) = ( − ) ( − ) ( + ) = ( − ) Sample Set A Find the following products. Example 10.35.  8 ⋅ 6 Multiply these absolute values. 8 ⋅ 6 = 48 Since the numbers have the same sign, the product is positive. Thus, 8⋅6=+48, or 8⋅6 = 48. Example 10.36.  ( − 8)( − 6) Multiply these absolute values. 8 ⋅ 6 = 48 Since the numbers have the same sign, the product is positive. Thus, ( − 8)( − 6)=+48, or ( − 8)( − 6) = 48. Example 10.37.  ( − 4)(7) Multiply these absolute values. 4 ⋅ 7 = 28 Since the numbers have opposite signs, the product is negative. Thus, ( − 4)(7) = − 28. Example 10.38.  6( − 3) Multiply these absolute values. 6 ⋅ 3 = 18 Since the numbers have opposite signs, the product is negative. Thus, 6( − 3) = − 18. Practice Set A Find the following products.
