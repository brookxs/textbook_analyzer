Conversion Table Listed below, in the unit conversion table, are some of the common metric units of measure. Table 9.4.

The weight of a body is related to gravity whereas the mass of a body is not. For example, your weight on the earth is different than it is on the moon, but your mass is the same in both places. Mass is a measure of a body's resistance to motion. The more massive a body, the more resistant it is to motion. Also, more massive bodies weigh more than less massive bodies. Converting Metric Units To convert from one metric unit to another metric unit: Determine the location of the original number on the metric scale (pictured in each of the following examples). Move the decimal point of the original number in the same direction and same number of places as is necessary to move to the metric unit you wish to go to. We can also convert from one metric unit to another using unit fractions. Both methods are shown in Example 9.4 of the section called “Sample Set A”. Sample Set A Example 9.4.  Convert 3 kilograms to grams. 3 kg can be written as 3.0 kg. Then, Thus, 3kg = 3,000 g. We can also use unit fractions to make this conversion. Since we are converting to grams, and 1,000    g = 1   kg, we choose the unit fraction since grams is in the numerator. Example 9.5.  Convert 67.2 hectoliters to milliliters. Thus, 67.2 hL = 6,720,000 mL. Example 9.6.  Convert 100.07 centimeters to meters. Thus, 100.07 cm = 1.0007 m. Example 9.7.  Convert 0.16 milligrams to grams. Thus, 0.16   mg = 0.00016 g. Practice Set A Exercise 9.3.1. (Go to Solution) Convert 411 kilograms to grams. Exercise 9.3.2. (Go to Solution) Convert 5.626 liters to centiliters. Exercise 9.3.3. (Go to Solution) Convert 80 milliliters to kiloliters. Exercise 9.3.4. (Go to Solution) Convert 150 milligrams to centigrams. Exercise 9.3.5. (Go to Solution) Convert 2.5 centimeters to meters.
