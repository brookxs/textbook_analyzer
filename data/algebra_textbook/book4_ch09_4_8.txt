Multiplying a Denominate Number by a Whole Number Let's examine the repeated sum Recalling that multiplication is a description of repeated addition, by the distribu­tive property we have From these observations, we can suggest the following rule. Multiplying a Denominate Number by a Whole Number To multiply a denominate number by a whole number, multiply the number part of each unit by the whole number and affix the unit to this product. Sample Set C Perform the following multiplications. Simplify if necessary. Example 9.16.  Since 3 ft = 1 yd and 12  in. = 1 ft, Example 9.17.  Practice Set C Perform the following multiplications. Simplify. Exercise 9.4.13. (Go to Solution) 2⋅(10 min) Exercise 9.4.14. (Go to Solution) 5⋅(3 qt) Exercise 9.4.15. (Go to Solution) 4⋅(5 ft 8 in.) Exercise 9.4.16.
