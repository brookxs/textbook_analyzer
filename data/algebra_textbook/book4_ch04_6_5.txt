Dividing Fractions Our concept of division is that it indicates how many times one quantity is con­tained in another quantity. For example, using the diagram we can see that there are 6 one-thirds in 2. There are 6 one-thirds in 2. Since 2 contains six 's we express this as Using these observations, we can suggest the following method for dividing a number by a fraction. Dividing One Fraction by Another Fraction To divide a first fraction by a second, nonzero fraction, multiply the first traction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. Invert and Multiply This method is commonly referred to as "invert the divisor and multiply." Sample Set B Perform the following divisions. Example 4.49.  . The divisor is . Its reciprocal is . Multiply by . Example 4.50.  The divisor is . Its reciprocal is . Multiply by . Example 4.51.  . The divisor is . Its reciprocal is . Multiply by . Example 4.52.  . Convert each mixed number to an improper fraction. . . The divisor is . Its reciprocal is . Multiply by . Example 4.53.  . First conveniently write 8 as . The divisor is . Its reciprocal is . Multiply by . Example 4.54.  . The divisor is . Its reciprocal is . Example 4.55.  How many -inch-wide packages can be placed in a box 19 inches wide? The problem is to determine how many two and three eighths are contained in 19, that is, what is ? Convert the divisor to an improper fraction. Write the dividend 19 as . The divisor is . Its reciprocal is . Thus, 8 packages will fit into the box. Practice Set B Perform the following divisions. Exercise 4.6.8. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.6.9. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.6.10.
