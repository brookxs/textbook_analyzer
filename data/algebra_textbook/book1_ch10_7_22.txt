Astrophysical Problem Exercise 10.7.33. A very interesting application of quadratic equations is determining the length of a solar eclipse (the moon passing between the earth and sun). The length of a solar eclipse is found by solving the quadratic equation ( a + b t ) 2 + ( c + d t ) 2 = ( e + f t ) 2 for t . The letters a,b,c,d,e, and f are constants that pertain to a particular eclipse. The equation is a quadratic equation in t and can be solved by the quadratic formula (and definitely a calculator). Two values of t will result. The length of the eclipse is just the difference of these t -values. The following constants are from a solar eclipse that occurred on August 3, 431 B.C.Determine the length of this particular solar eclipse. Astrophysical Problem Exercise 10.7.33.
