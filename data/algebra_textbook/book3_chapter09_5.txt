 || Deriving the Quadratic Formula The quadratic formula can be derived by using the technique of completing the square on the general quadratic formula: Given: Divide through by a: Move the constant term to the right side: Add the square of one-half the coefficient of x to both sides: Factor the left side (which is now a perfect square), and rearrange the right side: Get the right side over a common denominator: Take the square root of both sides (remembering to use plus-or-minus): Solve for x:  ||
