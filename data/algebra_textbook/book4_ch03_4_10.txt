The Prime Factorization of a Natural Number The following method provides a way of finding the prime factorization of a natural number. The Method of Finding the Prime Factorization of a Natural Number Divide the number repeatedly by the smallest prime number that will divide into it a whole number of times (without a remainder). When the prime number used in step 1 no longer divides into the given number without a remainder, repeat the division process with the next largest prime that divides the given number. Continue this process until the quotient is smaller than the divisor. The prime factorization of the given number is the product of all these prime divisors. If the number has no prime divisors, it is a prime number. We may be able to use some of the tests for divisibility we studied in Section 2.5 to help find the primes that divide the given number. Sample Set C Example 3.29.  Find the prime factorization of 60. Since the last digit of 60 is 0, which is even, 60 is divisible by 2. We will repeatedly divide by 2 until we no longer can. We shall divide as follows: The quotient 1 is finally smaller than the divisor 5, and the prime factorization of 60 is the product of these prime divisors. 60 = 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 We use exponents when possible. 60 = 2 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 Example 3.30.  Find the prime factorization of 441. 441 is not divisible by 2 since its last digit is not divisible by 2. 441 is divisible by 3 since 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 and 9 is divisible by 3. The quotient 1 is finally smaller than the divisor 7, and the prime factorization of 441 is the product of these prime divisors. 441 = 3 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 7 ⋅ 7 Use exponents. 441 = 3 2 ⋅ 7 2 Example 3.31.  Find the prime factorization of 31.
