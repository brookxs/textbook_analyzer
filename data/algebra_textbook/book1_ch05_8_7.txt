(Go to Solution) An examination of the winning speeds in the Indianapolis 500 automobile race from 1961 to 1970 produces the equation y = 1.93x + 137.60 , where x is the number of years from 1960 and y is the winning speed. Statistical methods were used to obtain the equation, and, for a given year, the equation gives only the approximate winning speed. Use the equation y = 1.93x + 137.60 to find the approximate winning speed in 1965 1970 1986 1990 Exercise 5.8.45. In electricity theory, Ohm’s law relates electrical current to voltage by the equation y = 0.00082x , where x is the voltage in volts and y is the current in amperes. This equation was found by statistical methods and for a given voltage yields only an approximate value for the current. Use the equation y = 0.00082x to find the approximate current for a voltage of 6 volts 10 volts Exercise 5.8.46. (Go to Solution) Statistical methods have been used to obtain a relationship between the actual and reported number of German submarines sunk each month by the U.S. Navy in World War II. The equation expressing the approximate number of actual sinkings, y , for a given number of reported sinkings, x , is y = 1.04x + 0.76 . Find the approximate number of actual sinkings of German submarines if the reported number of sinkings is 4 9 10 Exercise 5.8.47. Statistical methods have been used to obtain a relationship between the heart weight (in milligrams) and the body weight (in milligrams) of 10-month-old diabetic offspring of crossbred male mice. The equation expressing the approximate body weight for a given heart weight is y = 0.213x – 4.44 . Find the approximate body weight for a heart weight of 210 mg 245 mg Exercise 5.8.48. (Go to Solution) Statistical methods have been used to produce the equation y = 0.176x − 0.64 . This equation gives the approximate red blood cell count (in millions) of a dog’s blood, y , for a given packed cell volume (in millimeters), x . Find the approximate red blood cell count for a packed cell volume of 40 mm 42 mm Exercise 5.8.49. An industrial machine can run at different speeds. The machine also produces defective items, and the number of defective items it produces appears to be related to the speed at which the machine is running. Statistical methods found that the equation y = 0.73x − 0.86 is able to give the approximate number of defective items, y , for a given machine speed, x . Use this equation to find the approximate number of defective items for a machine speed of 9 12 Exercise 5.8.50. (Go to Solution) A computer company has found, using statistical techniques, that there is a relationship between the aptitude test scores of assembly line workers and their productivity. Using data accumulated over a period of time, the equation y = 0.89x − 41.78 was derived. The x represents an aptitude test score and y the approximate corresponding number of items assembled per hour. Estimate the number of items produced by a worker with an aptitude score of 80 95 Exercise 5.8.51. Chemists, making use of statistical techniques, have been able to express the approximate weight of potassium bromide, W , that will dissolve in 100 grams of water at T degrees centigrade. The equation expressing this relationship is W = 0.52T + 54.2 . Use this equation to predict the potassium bromide weight that will dissolve in 100 grams of water that is heated to a temperature of 70 degrees centigrade 95 degrees centigrade Exercise 5.8.52. (Go to Solution) The marketing department at a large company has been able to express the relationship between the demand for a product and its price by using statistical techniques. The department found, by analyzing studies done in six different market areas, that the equation giving the approximate demand for a product (in thousands of units) for a particular price (in cents) is y = − 14.15x + 257.11 . Find the approximate number of units demanded when the price is $0.12 $0.15 Exercise 5.8.53. The management of a speed-reading program claims that the approximate speed gain (in words per minute), G , is related to the number of weeks spent in its program, W , is given by the equation G = 26.68W − 7.44 . Predict the approximate speed gain for a student who has spent 3 weeks in the program 10 weeks in the program Calculator Problems Exercise 5.8.44.
