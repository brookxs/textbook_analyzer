Perpendicular Lines Two lines are perpendicular if they meet and form a right angle (90 degrees). For example, the lines L1 and L2 in Figure 3.80 are perpendicular, but the lines L1 and L2 in Figure 3.81 are not perpendicular. x y L1 L2 Figure 3.80: The lines L1 and L2 are perpendicular. They meet and form a right angle (90 degrees). x y L1 L2 Figure 3.81: The lines L1 and L2 are not perpendicular. They do not form a right angle (90 degrees). Before continuing, we need to establish a relation between the slopes of two perpendicular lines. So, consider the perpendicular lines L1 and L2 in Figure 3.82. x y L1 L2 1 m11 −m1 Figure 3.82: Perpendicular lines L1 and L2. Things to note: 1. If we were to rotate line L1 ninety degrees counter-clockwise, then L1 would align with the line L2, as would the right triangles revealing their slopes. 2. L1 has slope ∆y ∆x = m1 1 = m1. 220 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING 3. L2 has slope ∆y ∆x = 1 −m1 = − 1 m1 . Slopes of perpendicular lines. If L1 and L2 are perpendicular lines and L1 has slope m1, the L2 has slope −1/m1. That is, the slope of L2 is the negative reciprocal of the slope of L1. Examples: To find the slope of a perpendicular line, invert the slope of the first line and negate. • If the slope of L1 is 2, then the slope of the perpendicular line L2 is −1/2. • If the slope of L1 is −3/4, then the slope of the perpendicular line L2 is 4/3. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Sketch the line y = − 23x − 3, then sketch the line throughFind the equation of the line that passes through the point (−3, 1) and is perpendicular to the line y = − 12x+ 1. (2, 1) that is perpendicular to the line y = − 23x− 3. Find the equation of this perpendicular line. Solution: Note that y = − 23x−3 is in slope-intercept form y = mx+b. Hence, its slope is −2/3 and its y-intercept is (0,−3). Plot the y-intercept (0,−3), move right 3 units, down two units, then draw the line (see Figure 3.83). −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆x = 3 ∆y = −2(0,−3) Figure 3.83: The line y = − 23x− 3. −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 3 ∆x = 2 (2, 1) Figure 3.84: Adding a line perpen- dicular to y = − 23x− 3. Because the line y = − 23x−3 has slope −2/3, the slope of the line perpendicular to this line will be the negative reciprocal of −2/3, namely 3/2. Thus, to draw the perpendicular line, start at the given point (2, 1), move up 3 units, right 2 units, then draw the line (see Figure 3.84). 3.5. POINT-SLOPE FORM OF A LINE 221 To find the equation of the perpendicular line in Figure 3.84, use the point- slope form, substitute 3/2 for m, then (2, 1) for (x0, y0). That is, substitute 2 for x0, then 1 for y0. y − y0 = m(x− x0) Point-slope form. y − 1 = 3 2 (x− 2) Substitute: 3/2 for m, 2 for x0, and 1 for y0. Check: In this example, we were not required to solve for y, so we can save ourselves some checking work by writing the equation y − 1 = 3 2 (x − 2) in the form y = 3 2 (x− 2) + 1 by adding 1 to both sides of the first equation. Next, enter each equation as shown in Figure 3.85, then select 6:ZStandard to produce the image in Figure 3.86. Figure 3.85: Enter equations of per- pendicular lines. Figure 3.86: 6:ZStandard pro- duces two lines that do not look perpendicular. Note that the lines in Figure 3.86 do not appear to be perpendicular. Have we done something wrong? The answer is no! The fact that the calculator’s viewing screen is wider than it is tall is distorting the angle at which the lines meet. To make the calculator result match the result in Figure 3.84, change the window settings as shown in Figure 3.87, then select 5:ZSquare from the ZOOM menu to produce the image in Figure 3.88. Note the close correlation of the calculator lines in Figure 3.88 to the hand-drawn lines in Figure 3.84. This gives us confidence that we’ve captured the correct answer.
