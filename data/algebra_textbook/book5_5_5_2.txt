Dividing With Like Bases Like multiplication, we will also be frequently asked to divide exponential ex- pressions with like bases, such as x7/x4. Again, the key is to remember that the exponent tells us how many times to write the base as a factor, so we can write: x7 x4 = x · x · x · x · x · x · x x · x · x · x· = ! x · !x · !x · !x · x · x · x !x · !x · !x · !x· = x3 Note how we cancel four x’s in the numerator for four x’s in the denominator. However, in a sense we are “subtracting four x’s” from the numerator, so a 346 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS faster way to proceed is to repeat the base and subtract the exponents, as follows:Here is another nice argument why a0 = 1, provided a != 0. Start with: a1 a1 = 1 Repeat the base and subtract the exponents. a1−1 = 1 Simplify. a0 = 1 x7 x4 = x7−4 = x3 The preceding discussion is an example of the second general law of expo- nents. Dividing With Like Bases. To divide two exponential expressions with like bases, repeat the base and subtract the exponents. Given a != 0, am an = am−n Note that the subtraction of the exponents follows the rule “top minus bottom.” You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify each of the following expressions:Simplify: 45 43 (a) x12 x3 (b) 57 57 (c) (2x+ 1)8 (2x+ 1)3 Solution: In each example we have like bases. Thus, the approach will be the same for each example: repeat the base and subtract the exponents. (a) x12 x3 = x12−3 = x9 (b) 57 57 = 57−7 = 50 = 1 (c) (2x+ 1)8 (2x+ 1)3 = (2x+ 1)8−3 = (2x+ 1)5 With a little practice, each of the examples can be simplified mentally. Repeat the base and subtract the exponents in your head: x12/x3 = x9, 57/54 = 53, and (2x+ 1)8/(2x+ 1)3 = (2x+ 1)5.Answer: 42 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify: 12x5y7 4x3y2Simplify: 15a6b9 3ab5 Solution: We first express the fraction as a product of three fractions, the latter two with a common base. In the first line of the following solution, 5.5. LAWS OF EXPONENTS 347 note that if you multiply numerators and denominators of the three separate fractions, the product equals the original fraction on the left. 12x5y7 4x3y2 = 12 4 · x 5 x3 · y 7 y2 Break into a product of three fractions. = 3x5−3y7−2 Simplify: 12/4=3. Then repeat the common bases and subtract the exponents. = 3x2y5 Simplify. Answer: 5a5b4 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Simplify: x5n−4 x3−2n Simplify: x3n−6 xn+2 Solution: Again, we repeat the base and subtract the exponents. x5n−4 x3−2n = x(5n−4)−(3−2n) Repeat the base, subtract exponents. = x5n−4−3+2n Distribute the minus sign. = x7n−7 Simplify. Combine like terms. Answer: x2n−8 ! Dividing With Like Bases Like multiplication, we will also be frequently asked to divide exponential ex- pressions with like bases, such as x7/x4.
