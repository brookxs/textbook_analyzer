Finding Volumes of Some Common Geometric Objects Sample Set B Example 9.32.  Find the volume of the rectangular solid. The volume of this rectangular solid is 270 cu in. Example 9.33.  Find the approximate volume of the sphere. The approximate volume of this sphere is 904.32 cu cm, which is often written as 904.32 cm3. Example 9.34.  Find the approximate volume of the cylinder. The volume of this cylinder is approximately 588.05292 cu ft. The volume is approximate because we approximated π with 3.14. Example 9.35.  Find the approximate volume of the cone. Round to two decimal places. The volume of this cone is approximately 20.93 cu mm. The volume is approximate because we approximated π with 3.14. Practice Set B Find the volume of each geometric object. If π is required, approximate it with 3.14 and find the approximate volume.
