Algebraic Definition of Absolute Value From the problems in the section called “Sample Set A”, we can suggest the following algebraic defini­tion of absolute value. Note that the definition has two parts. Absolute Value—Algebraic Approach Algebraic definition of absolute value The absolute value of a number a is The algebraic definition takes into account the fact that the number a could be either positive or zero (a ≥ 0) or negative (a < 0). If the number a is positive or zero (a ≥ 0), the upper part of the definition applies. The upper part of the definition tells us that if the number enclosed in the absolute value bars is a nonnegative number, the absolute value of the number is the number itself. The lower part of the definition tells us that if the number enclosed within the absolute value bars is a negative number, the absolute value of the number is the opposite of the number. The opposite of a negative number is a positive number. Note The definition says that the vertical absolute value lines may be elimi­nated only if we know whether the number inside is positive or negative. Sample Set B Use the algebraic definition of absolute value to find the following values. Example 10.19.  ∣ 8 ∣ . The number enclosed within the absolute value bars is a nonnegative number, so the upper part of the definition applies. This part says that the absolute value of 8 is 8 itself. ∣ 8 ∣ = 8 Example 10.20.  ∣ − 3 ∣ . The number enclosed within absolute value bars is a negative number, so the lower part of the definition applies. This part says that the absolute value of -3 is the opposite of -3, which is − ( − 3). By the definition of absolute value and the double-negative property, ∣ − 3 ∣ = − ( − 3 ) = 3 Practice Set B Use the algebraic definition of absolute value to find the following values.
