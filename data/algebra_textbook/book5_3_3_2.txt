Slope as Rate Here is the definition of the slope of a line. Slope. The slope of a line is the rate at which the dependent variable is chang- ing with respect to the independent variable. For example, if the dependent 186 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING variable is y and the independent variable is x, then the slope of the line is: Slope = ∆y ∆x You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. In Example 1, an object released from rest saw that its speedStarting from rest, an automobile picks up speed at a constant rate of 5 miles per hour every second (5 (mi/hr)/s). The constant rate forces the graph of the speed of the object versus time to be a line. Calculate the slope of this line. increased at a constant rate of 10 meters per second per second (10 (m/s)/s or 10m/s2). This constant rate forced the graph of the speed versus time to be a line, shown in Figure 3.43. Calculate the slope of this line. Solution: Start by selecting two points P (2, 20) and Q(8, 80) on the line, as shown in Figure 3.44. To find the slope of this line, the definition requires that we find the rate at which the dependent variable v changes with respect to the independent variable t. That is, the slope is the change in v divided by the change in t.

Now, as we move from point P (2, 20) to point Q(8, 80), the speed changes from 20 m/s to 80 m/s. Thus, the change in the speed is: ∆v = 80m/s− 20m/s = 60m/s 3.3. RATES AND SLOPE 187 Similarly, as we move from point P (2, 20) to point Q(8, 80), the time changes from 2 seconds to 8 seconds. Thus, the change in time is: ∆t = 8 s− 2 s = 6 s Now that we have both the change in the dependent and independent variables, we can calculate the slope. Slope = ∆v ∆t = 60m/s 6 s = 10 m/s s Therefore, the slope of the line is 10 meters per second per second (10 (m/s)/s or 10m/s2). The slope of a line does not depend upon the points you select. Let’s try the slope calculation again, using two different points and a more compact presentation of the required calculations. Pick points P (3, 30) and Q(7, 70) as shown in Figure 3.45. Using these two new points, the slope is the rate at which the dependent variable v changes with respect to the independent variable t. Slope = ∆v ∆t = 70m/s− 30m/s 7 s− 3 s = 40m/s 4 s = 10 m/s s Again, the slope of the line is 10 (m/s)/s. Answer: 5 (mi/hr)/s ! Example 2 points out the following fact. Slope is independent of the selected points. It does not matter which two points you pick on the line to calculate its slope. The next example demonstrates that the slope is also independent of the order of subtraction. 188 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING You Try It! EXAMPLE 3.

To calculate the slope of the line through the points P (−1,−2) and Q(3, 3), we must calculate the change in both the independent and dependent variables. We’ll do this in two different ways. Warning! If you are not consistent in the direction you subtract, you will not get the correct answer for the slope. For example: 3− (−2) −1− 3 = − 5 4 In this case, we subtracted the y-coordinate of point P (−1,−2) from the y-coordinate of point Q(3, 3), but then we changed horses in midstream, subtracting the x-coordinate of point Q(3, 3) from the x-coordinate of point P (−1,−2). Note that we get the negative of the correct answer. Subtract the coordinates of point P (−1,−2) from the coordinates of point Q(3, 3). Slope = ∆y ∆x = 3− (−2) 3− (−1) = 5 4 Subtract the coordinates of point Q(3, 3) from the coordinates of point P (−1,−2). Slope = ∆y ∆x = −2− 3 −1− 3 = −5 −4 = 5 4 Note that regardless of the direction of subtraction, the slope is 5/4.Answer: 3/5 ! 3.3. RATES AND SLOPE 189 Example 3 demonstrates the following fact. The direction of subtraction does not matter. When calculating the slope of a line through two points P and Q, it does not matter which way you subtract, provided you remain consistent in your choice of direction.

Now, as we move from point P (2, 20) to point Q(8, 80), the speed changes from 20 m/s to 80 m/s. Thus, the change in the speed is: ∆v = 80m/s− 20m/s = 60m/s 3.3. RATES AND SLOPE 187 Similarly, as we move from point P (2, 20) to point Q(8, 80), the time changes from 2 seconds to 8 seconds. Thus, the change in time is: ∆t = 8 s− 2 s = 6 s Now that we have both the change in the dependent and independent variables, we can calculate the slope. Slope = ∆v ∆t = 60m/s 6 s = 10 m/s s Therefore, the slope of the line is 10 meters per second per second (10 (m/s)/s or 10m/s2). The slope of a line does not depend upon the points you select.
