Rules Product of Different Powers:    aman = am + n IMPORTANT: all the numbers must have the same bases  (the same ‘a’) Example:  (42)(43) = 45   This is easy to see if you write out the exponents:   (42)(43) = (4 · 4) · (4 · 4 · 4) = 4 · 4 · 4 · 4 · 4 = 45    WARNING: Do not attempt to use this rule for addition:   42 + 43 is NOT 45. In fact there is no way to simplify xn + xm if n and m are different powers. Power Raised to a Power:      Example:  (42)3 = 46   This is also easy to see if you expand the exponents:   (42)3 = (42)(42)(42) = (4 · 4) (4 · 4) (4 · 4) = 4 · 4 · 4 · 4 · 4 · 4 = 46   There are more rules for combining numbers with exponents, but this is enough for now.
