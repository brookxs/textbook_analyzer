The Base Ten Positional Number System Digits The Hindu-Arabic numerals 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 are called digits. We can form any number in the number system by selecting one or more digits and placing them in certain positions. Each position has a particular value. The Hindu mathematician who devised the system about A.D. 500 stated that "from place to place each is ten times the preceding." Base Ten Positional Systems It is for this reason that our number system is called a positional number system with base ten. Commas When numbers are composed of more than three digits, commas are sometimes used to separate the digits into groups of three. Periods These groups of three are called periods and they greatly simplify reading numbers. In the Hindu-Arabic numeration system, a period has a value assigned to each or its three positions, and the values are the same for each period. The position values are Thus, each period contains a position for the values of one, ten, and hundred. Notice that, in looking from right to left, the value of each position is ten times the preceding. Each period has a particular name. As we continue from right to left, there are more periods. The five periods listed above are the most common, and in our study of introductory mathematics, they are sufficient. The following diagram illustrates our positional number system to trillions. (There are, to be sure, other periods.) In our positional number system, the value of a digit is determined by its position in the number. Sample Set B Example 1.1.  Find the value of 6 in the number 7,261. Since 6 is in the tens position of the units period, its value is 6 tens. 6 tens = 60 Example 1.2.  Find the value of 9 in the number 86,932,106,005. Since 9 is in the hundreds position of the millions period, its value is 9 hundred millions. 9 hundred millions = 9 hundred million Example 1.3.  Find the value of 2 in the number 102,001. Since 2 is in the ones position of the thousands period, its value is 2 one thousands. 2 one thousands = 2 thousand Practice Set B Exercise 1.2.2. (Go to Solution) Find the value of 5 in the number 65,000. Exercise 1.2.3. (Go to Solution) Find the value of 4 in the number 439,997,007,010. Exercise 1.2.4. (Go to Solution) Find the value of 0 in the number 108. The Base Ten Positional Number System Digits The Hindu-Arabic numerals 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 are called digits.
