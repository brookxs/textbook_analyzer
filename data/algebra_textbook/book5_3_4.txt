3.4 Slope-Intercept Form of a Line We start with the definition of the y-intercept of a line. The y-intercept. The point (0, b) where the graph of a line crosses the y-axis is called the y-intercept of the line. We will now generate the slope-intercept formula for a line having y-intercept (0, b) and Slope = m (see Figure 3.59). Let (x, y) be an arbitrary point on the line. x y (0, b) (x, y) Slope = m Figure 3.59: Line with y-intercept at (0, b) and Slope = m. Start with the fact that the slope of the line is the rate at which the dependent variable is changing with respect to the independent variable. Slope = ∆y ∆x Slope formula. Substitute m for the slope. To determine both the change in y and the change in x, subtract the coordinates of the point (0, b) from the point (x, y). m = y − b x− 0 Substitute m for the Slope.∆y = y − b and ∆x = x− 0. m = y − b x Simplify. Clear fractions from the equation by multiplying both sides by the common denominator. mx = [ y − b x ] x Multiply both sides by x. mx = y − b Cancel. 202 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING Solve for y. mx+ b = y − b + b Add b to both sides. mx+ b = y Simplify. Thus, the equation of the line is y = mx+ b. The Slope-Intercept form of a line. The equation of the line having y- intercept (0, b) and slope m is: y = mx+ b Because this form of a line depends on knowing the slope m and the intercept (0, b), this form is called the slope-intercept form of a line.

Solution: Compare the equation y = 35x + 1 with the slope-intercept form y = mx + b, and note that m = 3/5 and b = 1. This means that the slope is 3/5 and the y-intercept is (0, 1). Start by plotting the y-intercept (0, 1), then move uward 3 units and right 5 units, arriving at the point (5, 4).

When we compare the calculator produced graph in Figure 3.61 to the hand drawn graph in Figure 3.60, they look a bit different. This difference is due to the fact that the calculator’s viewing window is wider than it is tall. On the other hand, the grid in Figure 3.60 is perfectly square.

Label the line with the slope-intercept form of its equation. the line with the slope-intercept form of its equation. Solution: Plot the y-intercept (0, 2). Now use the slope −7/3. Start at (0, 2), then move down seven units, followed by a three unit move to the right to the point (3,−5). Draw the line through the points (0, 2) and (3,−5). (see Figure 3.64). Next, the y-intercept is (0, 2), so b = 2. Further, the slope is −7/3, so m = −7/3. Substitute these numbers into the slope-intercept form of the line. y = mx+ b Slope-intercept form. y = −7 3 x+ 2 Substitute: −7/3 for m, 2 for b.
