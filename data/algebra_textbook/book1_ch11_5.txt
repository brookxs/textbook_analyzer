 || The Five-Step Method When solving practical problems, it is often more convenient to introduce two variables rather than only one. Two variables should be introduced only when two relationships can be found within the problem. Each relationship will produce an equation, and a system of two equations in two variables will result.We will use the five-step method to solve these problems. Introduce two variables, one for each unknown quantity. Look for two relationships within the problem. Translate the verbal phrases into mathematical expressions to form two equations. Solve the resulting system of equations. Check the solution. Write a conclusion.  ||
