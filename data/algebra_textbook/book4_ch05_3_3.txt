Addition and Subtraction of Fractions Least Common Multiple (LCM) and Least Common Denominator (LCD) In Section 3.6, we examined the least common multiple (LCM) of a collection of numbers. If these numbers are used as denominators of fractions, we call the least common multiple, the least common denominator (LCD). Method of Adding or Subtracting Fractions with Unlike Denominators To add or subtract fractions having unlike denominators, convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction having as a denominator the least common denomina­tor ( LCD) of the original denominators. Sample Set A Find the following sums and differences. Example 5.10.  [ERROR: MathML not converted]. The denominators are not the same. Find the LCD of 6 and 4. [ERROR: MathML not converted] Write each of the original fractions as a new, equivalent fraction having the common denomina­tor 12. [ERROR: MathML not converted] To find a new numerator, we divide the original denominator into the LCD. Since the original denominator is being multiplied by this quotient, we must multiply the original numerator by this quotient. 12 ÷ 6 = 2 12 ÷ 4 = 3 [ERROR: MathML not converted] Example 5.11.  [ERROR: MathML not converted]. The denominators are not the same. Find the LCD of 2 and 3. LCD = 2 ⋅ 3 = 6 Write each of the original fractions as a new, equivalent fraction having the common denominator 6. [ERROR: MathML not converted] To find a new numerator, we divide the original denominator into the LCD. Since the original denominator is being multiplied by this quotient, we must multiply the original numerator by this quotient. 6 ÷ 2 = 3 Multiply the numerator 1 by 3. 6 ÷ 2 = 3 Multiply the numerator 2 by 2. [ERROR: MathML not converted] Example 5.12.  [ERROR: MathML not converted]. The denominators are not the same. Find the LCD of 9 and 12. [ERROR: MathML not converted] [ERROR: MathML not converted] 36÷9 = 4 Multiply the numerator 5 by 4. 36÷12 = 3 Multiply the numerator 5 by 3. [ERROR: MathML not converted] Example 5.13.  [ERROR: MathML not converted] The denominators are not the same. Find the LCD of 6, 8, and 16 [ERROR: MathML not converted] [ERROR: MathML not converted] 48÷6 = 8 Multiply the numerator 5 by 8 48÷8 = 6 Multiply the numerator 1 by 6 48÷16 = 3 Multiply the numerator 7 by 3 [ERROR: MathML not converted] Practice Set A Find the following sums and differences.
