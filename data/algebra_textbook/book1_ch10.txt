 ||  || Standard Form of A Quadratic Equation In Chapter (Section 5.1) we studied linear equations in one and two variables and methods for solving them. We observed that a linear equation in one variable was any equation that could be written in the form a x + b = 0, a ≠ 0, and a linear equation in two variables was any equation that could be written in the form a x + b y = c, where a and b are not both 0. We now wish to study quadratic equations in one variable. Quadratic Equation A quadratic equation is an equation of the form a x 2 + b x + c = 0, a ≠ 0. The standard form of the quadratic equation is a x 2 + b x + c = 0, a ≠ 0. For a quadratic equation in standard form a x 2 + b x + c = 0, a is the coefficient of x 2 . b is the coefficient of x. c is the constant term.  || Zero-Factor Property Our goal is to solve quadratic equations. The method for solving quadratic equations is based on the zero-factor property of real numbers. We were introduced to the zero-factor property in Section Section 8.2. We state it again. Zero-Factor Property If two numbers a and b are multiplied together and the resulting product is 0, then at least one of the numbers must be 0. Algebraically, if a  ·  b = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0, or both a = 0 and b = 0.  ||  || Factoring Method To solve quadratic equations by factoring, we must make use of the zero-factor property. Set the equation equal to zero, that is, get all the nonzero terms on one side of the equal sign and 0 on the other. a x 2 + b x + c = 0 Factor the quadratic expression. ( )( ) = 0 By the zero-factor property, at least one of the factors must be zero, so, set each of the factors equal to 0 and solve for the variable.  || Solving Mentally After Factoring Let’s consider problems 4 and 5 of Sample Set A in more detail. Let’s look particularly at the factorizations ( 2x − 3 )( x + 5 ) = 0 and ( 9x + 2 )( 7x − 3 ) = 0. The next step is to set each factor equal to zero and solve. We can solve mentally if we understand how to solve linear equations: we transpose the constant from the variable term and then divide by the coefficient of the variable.  ||  || The Method Of Extraction Of Roots Extraction of Roots Quadratic equations of the form x 2 − K = 0 can be solved by the method of extraction of roots by rewriting it in the form x 2 = K. To solve x 2 = K, we are required to find some number, x, that when squared produces K. This number, x, must be a square root of K. If K is greater than zero, we know that it possesses two square roots, and We also know thatWe now have two replacements for x that produce true statements when substituted into the equation. Thus, and are both solutions to x 2 = K. We use the notation to denote both the principal and the secondary square roots.  || The Nature of Solutions Solutions of x 2 = K For quadratic equations of the form x 2 = K, If K is greater than or equal to zero, the solutions are If K is negative, no real number solutions exist. If K is zero, the only solution is 0.  ||  Calculator Problems For the following problems, round each result to the nearest hundredth. Exercise 10.4.63.

(Go to Solution) 1.001x 2 − 0.999 = 0  ||  || The Logic Behind The Method Suppose we wish to solve the quadratic equation x 2 − 3x − 1 = 0. Since the equation is not of the form x 2 = K, we cannot use extraction of roots. Next, we try factoring, but after a few trials we see that x 2 − 3x − 1 is not factorable. We need another method for solving quadratic equations.The method we shall study is based on perfect square trinomials and extraction of roots. The method is called solving quadratic equations by completing the square. Consider the equation x 2 + 6x + 5 = 0. This quadratic equation could be solved by factoring, but we’ll use the method of completing the square. We will explain the method in detail after we look at this example. First we’ll rewrite the equation as x 2 + 6x = − 5 Then, we’ll add 9 to each side. We get x 2 + 6x + 9 = − 5 + 9 The left side factors as a perfect square trinomial. ( x + 3 ) 2 = 4 We can solve this by extraction of roots. Notice that when the roots are rational numbers, the equation is factorable.The big question is, “How did we know to add 9 to each side of the equation?” We can convert any quadratic trinomial appearing in an equation into a perfect square trinomial if we know what number to add to both sides. We can determine that particular number by observing the following situation: Consider the square of the binomial and the resulting perfect square trinomial ( x + p ) 2 = x 2 + 2p x + p 2 Notice that the constant term (the number we are looking for) can be obtained from the linear term 2p x. If we take one half the coefficient of and square it, we get the constant term p 2 . This is true for every perfect square trinomial with leading coefficient 1. In a perfect square trinomial with leading coefficient 1, the constant term is the square of one half the coefficient of the linear term. Study these examples to see what constant term will make the given binomial into a perfect square trinomial. Example 10.26.  x 2 + 6x.   The constant must be the square of one half the coefficient of x. Since the coefficient of x is 6, we haveThe constant is 9. x 2 + 6x + 9 = ( x + 3 ) 2 This is a perfect square trinomial. Example 10.27.  a 2 + 10a.   The constant must be the square of one half the coefficient of a. Since the coefficient of a is 10, we haveThe constant is 25. a 2 + 10a + 25 = ( a + 5 ) 2 Example 10.28.  y 2 + 3y.   The constant must be the square of one half the coefficient of y. Since the coefficient of y is 3, we haveThe constant is  || The Method Of Completing The Square Now, with these observations, we can describe the method of completing the square. The Method of Completing the Square Write the equation so that the constant term appears on the right side of equation. If the leading coefficient is different from 1, divide each term of the equation by that coefficient. Take one half of the coefficient of the linear term, square it, then add it to both sides of the equation. The trinomial on the left is now a perfect square trinomial and can be factored as ( ) 2 . The first term in the parentheses is the square root of the quadratic term. The last term in the parentheses is one-half the coefficient of the linear term. Solve this equation by extraction of roots.  ||  Calculator Problems For the following problems, round each solution to the nearest hundredth. Exercise 10.5.35. 5m 2 − 2m − 6 = 0 Exercise 10.5.36.

Standard Form The equation a x 2 + b x + c = 0 is the standard form of a quadratic equation.  || The Quadratic Formula When a quadratic equation is written in standard form so that the values a, b, and c are readily determined, the equation can be solved using the quadratic formula. The values that satisfy the equation are found by substituting the values a, b, and c into the formula Quadratic Formula Keep in mind that the plus or minus symbol, ± , is just a shorthand way of denoting the two possibilities:The quadratic formula can be derived by using the method of completing the square.  || Derivation Of The Quadratic Formula Solve a x 2 + b x + c = 0 for x by completing the square. Example 10.39.  Subtract c from both sides. a x 2 + b x = − c Example 10.40.  Divide both sides by a, the coefficient of x 2 . Example 10.41.  Now we have the proper form to complete the square.

Quadratic equations can arise from a variety of physical (applied) and mathematical (logical) problems. We will, again, apply the five-step method for solving word problems. Five-Step Method of Solving Word Problems Step 1:   Let x (or some other letter) represent the unknown quantity.

Once the quadratic equation is developed (step 2), try to solve it by factoring. If factoring doesn’t work, use the quadratic formula. A calculator may help to make some of the calculations a little less tedious.  || Astrophysical Problem Exercise 10.7.33. A very interesting application of quadratic equations is determining the length of a solar eclipse (the moon passing between the earth and sun). The length of a solar eclipse is found by solving the quadratic equation ( a + b t ) 2 + ( c + d t ) 2 = ( e + f t ) 2 for t . The letters a,b,c,d,e, and f are constants that pertain to a particular eclipse. The equation is a quadratic equation in t and can be solved by the quadratic formula (and definitely a calculator). Two values of t will result. The length of the eclipse is just the difference of these t -values. The following constants are from a solar eclipse that occurred on August 3, 431 B.C.Determine the length of this particular solar eclipse.  ||  || Parabolas We will now study the graphs of quadratic equations in two variables with general form Parabola All such graphs have a similar shape. The graph of a quadratic equation of this type Parabola is called a parabola and it will assume one of the following shapes. Vertex The high point or low point of a parabola is called the vertex of the parabola.  || Constructing Graphs of Parabolas We will construct the graph of a parabola by choosing several x -values, computing to find the corresponding y -values, plotting these ordered pairs, then drawing a smooth curve through them.  ||
