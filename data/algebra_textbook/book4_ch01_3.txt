 || Reading Whole Numbers To convert a number that is formed by digits into a verbal phrase, use the following method: Beginning at the right and working right to left, separate the number into distinct periods by inserting commas every three digits. Beginning at the left, read each period individually, saying the period name. Sample Set A Write the following numbers as words. Example 1.6.  Read 42958.

Example 1.7.  Read 307991343. Beginning at the right, we can separate this number into distinct periods by placing commas between the 1 and 3 and the 7 and 9. 307,991,343 Beginning at the left, we read each period individually. Three hundred seven million, nine hundred ninety-one thousand, three hundred forty-three. Example 1.8.  Read 36000000000001. Beginning at the right, we can separate this number into distinct periods by placing commas. 36,000,000,001 Beginning at the left, we read each period individually. Thirty-six trillion, one.

Starting at the beginning of the phrase, write each period of numbers individu­ally. Using commas to separate periods, combine the periods to form one number. Sample Set B Write each number using digits. Example 1.9.  Seven thousand, ninety-two. Using the comma as a period separator, we have 7,092 Example 1.10.  Fifty billion, one million, two hundred thousand, fourteen. Using the commas as period separators, we have 50,001,200,014 Example 1.11.  Ten million, five hundred twelve. The comma sets off the periods. We notice that there is no thousands period. We'll have to insert this ourselves. 10,000,512 Practice Set B Express each number using digits. Exercise 1.3.4. (Go to Solution) One hundred three thousand, twenty-five. Exercise 1.3.5.
