Multiplying and Dividing Rational Expressions We will concentrate on rational expressions with monomial numerators and denominators. Recall that to form the product of two rational numbers, we simply multiply numerators and denominators. The same technique is used to multiply any two rational expressions. Multiplying rational expressions. Given a/b and c/d, their product is defined as: a b · c d = ac bd Remember, you need only multiply numerators and denominators. For exam- ple: x 3 · 2 y = 2x 3y , 2a 3b2 · 5a 9b3 = 10a2 27b5 , and x 2y · ( − 3x 4y2 ) = −3x 2 8y3 Of course, as the next example shows, sometimes you also need to reduce your answer to lowest terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify: 2 x · x 2 4 Simplify: 9 x2 · x 6 506 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS Solution: Multiply numerators and denominators. 2 x · x 2 4 = 2x5 4x3 Now, there several different ways you can reduce this answer to lowest terms, two of which are shown below. You can factor numerator and de- nominator, then cancel common factors. 2x5 4x3 = 2 · x · x · x · x · x 2 · 2 · x · x · x = ! 2 · !x · !x · !x · x · x !2 · 2 · !x · !x · !x = x2 2 Or you can write the answer as a product, repeat the base and sub- tract exponents. 2x5 4x3 = 2 4 · x 5 x3 = 1 2 · x5−3 = 1 2 x2 As dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by 1/2, these answers are equivalent. Also, note that the right-hand method is more efficient.Answer: 3 2x ! Recall that when dividing fractions, we invert the second fraction and mul- tiply. Dividing rational expressions. Given a/b and c/d, their quotient is defined as: a b ÷ c d = a b · d c = ad bc You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Simplify: x2 y ÷ x 4 2y2Simplify: 3y x3 ÷ y 2 4x Solution: Invert, then multiply. x2 y ÷ x 4 2y2 = x2 y · 2y 2 x4 = 2x2y2 x4y Now, there several different ways you can reduce this answer to lowest terms, two of which are shown below. 7.3. SIMPLIFYING RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS 507 You can factor numerator and de- nominator, then cancel common factors. 2x2y2 x4y = 2 · x · x · y · y x · x · x · x · y = 2 · !x · !x · !y · y !x · !x · x · x · !y = 2y x2 Or you can write the answer as a product, repeat the base and sub- tract exponents. 2x2y2 x4y = 2 · x 2 x4 · y 2 y1 = 2x−2y1 = 2y x2 In the last step, x−2 is the same as 1/x2, then we multiply numerators and denominators. Note that the right-hand method is more efficient. Answer: 12 x2y !
