Solving Systems with the Graphing Calculator We’ve already had experience graphing equations with the graphing calculator. We’ve also used the TRACE button to estimate points of intersection. How- ever, the graphing calculator has a much more sophisticated tool for finding points of intersection. In the next example we’ll use the graphing calculator to find the solution of System 4.1 of Example 1. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Use the graphing calculator to solve the following system of Solve the following system of equations: 2x− 5y = 9 y = 2x− 5 equations: 3x+ 2y = 12 y = x+ 1 (4.5) Solution: To enter an equation in the Y= menu, the equation must first be 254 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS solved for y. Hence, we must first solve 3x+ 2y = 12 for y. 3x+ 2y = 12 Original equation. 2y = 12− 3x Subtract 3x from both sides of the equation. 2y 2 = 12− 3x 2 Divide both sides by 2. y = 12 2 − 3x 2 On the left, simplify. On the right, distribute division by 2. y = 6− 3 2 x Simplify. We can now substitute both equations of System 4.5 into the Y= menu (see Figure 4.12). Select 6:ZStandard from the ZOOM menu to produce the graphs shown in Figure 4.13. Figure 4.12: Enter System 4.5 equations into the Y= menu. Figure 4.13: Select 6:ZStandard to produce the graphs of the sys- tem (4.5) equations. The question now becomes “How do we calculate the coordinates of the point of intersection?” Look on your calculator case just above the TRACE button on the top row of buttons, where you’ll see the word CAlC, painted in the same color as the 2ND key. Press the 2ND key, then the TRACE button, which will open the CALCULATE menu shown in Figure 4.14. Select 5:intersect. The result is shown in Figure 4.15. The calculator has placed the cursor on the curve y = 6 − (3/2)x (see upper left corner of your viewing screen), and in the lower left corner the calculator is asking you if you want to use the selected curve as the “First curve.” Answer “yes” by pressing the ENTER button. Having the calculator ask “First curve,” “Second curve,” when there are only two curves on the screen may seem annoying. However, imagine the situation when there are three or more curves on the screen. Then these questions make good sense. You can change your selection of “First curve” or “Second curve” by using the up-and-down arrow keys to move the cursor to a different curve. The calculator responds as shown Figure 4.16. The cursor jumps to the curve y = x + 1 (see upper left corner of your viewing window), and in the lower left corner the calculator is asking you if you want to use the selected curve as the “Second curve.” Answer “yes” by pressing the ENTER key again. The calculator responds as shown Figure 4.17, asking you to “Guess.” In this case, leave the cursor where it is and press the ENTER key again to signal the calculator that you are making a guess at the current position of the cursor. The result of pressing ENTER to the “Guess” question in Figure 4.17 is shown in Figure 4.18, where the calculator now provides an approximation 4.1.

In those future cases, we’ll need to use the left-and-right arrow keys to move the cursor near the point of intersection we wish the calculator to find. viewing window. Note that the calculator has placed the cursor on the point of intersection in Figure 4.17 and reports that the approximate coordinates of the point of intersection are (2, 3).

Figure 4.21: Select 6:ZStandard to produce this window. Obviously, the point of intersection is off the screen to the right, so we’ll have to increase the value of Xmax (set Xmax = 20) as shown in Figure 4.22. Once you have made that change to Xmax, press the GRAPH button to produce the image shown in Figure 4.23. Figure 4.22: Change xmax to 20. Figure 4.23: Press the GRAPH button to produce this window. Now that the point of intersection is visible in the viewing window, press 2ND CALC and select 5:intersect from theCALCULATE menu (see Figure 4.25). Make three consecutive presses of the ENTER button to respond to “First curve,” “Second curve,” and “Guess.” The calculator responds with the im- age in Figure 4.25. Thus, the solution of System 4.6 is approximately (x, y) ≈ (13.54837, 3.1290323). Warning! Your calculator is an approximating machine.
