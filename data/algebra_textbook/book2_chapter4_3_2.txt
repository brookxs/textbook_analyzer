Clearing Fractions and Decimals Given a linear system where the equations have fractional coefficients, it is usually best to clear the fractions before beginning the elimination method.   Example 6: Solve: ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ − 1 10 x + 1 2 y = 4 5   1 7 x + 1 3 y = − 2 21 . Solution: Recall that we can clear fractions by multiplying both sides of an equation by the least common denominator (LCD). Take care to distribute and then simplify. This results in an equivalent system where the equations have integer coefficients, Solve using the elimination method. Back substitute. Answer: (−3, 1)   We can use a similar technique to clear decimals before solving.   Example 7: Solve: { 3 x − 0.6 y = − 0.9 − 0.5 x + 0.12 y = 0.16 . Solution: Multiply each equation by the lowest power of 10 necessary to result in integer coefficients. In this case, multiply the first equation by 10 and the second equation by 100. This results in an equivalent system where the equations have integer coefficients: Solve using the elimination method. Back substitute. Answer: (−0.2, 0.5)   Try this! Solve using elimination: ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ 1 3 x − 2 3 y = 3 1 3 x − 1 2 y = 8 3 .
