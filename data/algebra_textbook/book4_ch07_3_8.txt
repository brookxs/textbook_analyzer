Proportions Involving Rates Recall that a rate is a comparison, by division, of unlike denominate numbers. We must be careful when setting up proportions that involve rates. The form is impor­tant. For example, if a rate involves two types of units, say unit type 1 and unit type 2, we can write or Both cross products produce a statement of the type (unit type 1) ⋅ (unit type 2) = (unit type 1) ⋅ (unit type 2) which we take to mean the comparison Examples of correctly expressed proportions are the following: However, if we write the same type of units on different sides, such as, the cross product produces a statement of the form We can see that this is an incorrect comparison by observing the following example: It is incorrect to write for two reason. The cross product is numerically wrong: (2⋅4 ≠ 3⋅6). The cross product produces the statement “hooks are to hooks as poles are to poles,” which makes no sense.
