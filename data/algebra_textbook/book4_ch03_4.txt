 || Factors From observations made in the process of multiplication, we have seen that ( factor ) ⋅ ( factor ) = product Factors, Product The two numbers being multiplied are the factors and the result of the multiplication is the product. Now, using our knowledge of division, we can see that a first number is a factor of a second number if the first number divides into the second number a whole number of times (without a remainder). One Number as a Factor of Another A first number is a factor of a second number if the first number divides into the second number a whole number of times (without a remainder). We show this in the following examples: Example 3.23.  3 is a factor of 27, since 27÷3 = 9, or 3⋅9 = 27. Example 3.24.  7 is a factor of 56, since 56÷7 = 8, or 7⋅8 = 56. Example 3.25.  4 is not a factor of 10, since 10÷4 = 2R2. (There is a remainder.)  || Determining the Factors of a Whole Number We can use the tests for divisibility from Section 2.5 to determine all the factors of a whole number. Sample Set A Example 3.26.  Find all the factors of 24. The next number to try is 6, but we already have that 6 is a factor. Once we come upon a factor that we already have discovered, we can stop. All the whole number factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Practice Set A Find all the factors of each of the following numbers. Exercise 3.4.1. (Go to Solution) 6 Exercise 3.4.2.

(Go to Solution) 19  || Prime and Composite Numbers Notice that the only factors of 7 are 1 and 7 itself, and that the only factors of 3 are 1 and 3 itself. However, the number 8 has the factors 1, 2, 4, and 8, and the number 10 has the factors 1, 2, 5, and 10. Thus, we can see that a whole number can have only two factors (itself and 1) and another whole number can have several factors. We can use this observation to make a useful classification for whole numbers: prime numbers and composite numbers. Prime Number A whole number (greater than one) whose only factors are itself and 1 is called a prime number. The Number 1 is Not a Prime Number The first seven prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17. Notice that the whole number 1 is not considered to be a prime number, and the whole number 2 is the first prime and the only even prime number. Composite Number A whole number composed of factors other than itself and 1 is called a compos­ite number. Composite numbers are not prime numbers. Some composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 15. Sample Set B Determine which whole numbers are prime and which are composite. Example 3.27.  39. Since 3 divides into 39, the number 39 is composite: 39÷3 = 13 Example 3.28.  47. A few division trials will assure us that 47 is only divisible by 1 and 47. Therefore, 47 is prime. Practice Set B Determine which of the following whole numbers are prime and which are composite. Exercise 3.4.8. (Go to Solution) 3 Exercise 3.4.9. (Go to Solution) 16 Exercise 3.4.10.

We now state the Fundamental Principle of Arithmetic. Fundamental Principle of Arithmetic Except for the order of the factors, every natural number other than 1 can be factored in one and only one way as a product of prime numbers. Prime Factorization When a number is factored so that all its factors are prime numbers. the factori­zation is called the prime factorization of the number. The technique of prime factorization is illustrated in the following three examples. 10 = 5⋅2. Both 2 and 5 are primes. Therefore, 2⋅5 is the prime factorization of 10. 11. The number 11 is a prime number. Prime factorization applies only to composite numbers. Thus, 11 has no prime factorization. 60 = 2⋅30. The number 30 is not prime: 30 = 2⋅15. 60 = 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 15 The number 15 is not prime: 15 = 3⋅5 60 = 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 We'll use exponents. 60 = 2 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 The numbers 2, 3, and 5 are each prime. Therefore, 22⋅3⋅5 is the prime factorization of 60.  || The Prime Factorization of a Natural Number The following method provides a way of finding the prime factorization of a natural number. The Method of Finding the Prime Factorization of a Natural Number Divide the number repeatedly by the smallest prime number that will divide into it a whole number of times (without a remainder). When the prime number used in step 1 no longer divides into the given number without a remainder, repeat the division process with the next largest prime that divides the given number. Continue this process until the quotient is smaller than the divisor. The prime factorization of the given number is the product of all these prime divisors. If the number has no prime divisors, it is a prime number. We may be able to use some of the tests for divisibility we studied in Section 2.5 to help find the primes that divide the given number. Sample Set C Example 3.29.  Find the prime factorization of 60. Since the last digit of 60 is 0, which is even, 60 is divisible by 2. We will repeatedly divide by 2 until we no longer can. We shall divide as follows: The quotient 1 is finally smaller than the divisor 5, and the prime factorization of 60 is the product of these prime divisors. 60 = 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 We use exponents when possible. 60 = 2 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 Example 3.30.  Find the prime factorization of 441. 441 is not divisible by 2 since its last digit is not divisible by 2. 441 is divisible by 3 since 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 and 9 is divisible by 3. The quotient 1 is finally smaller than the divisor 7, and the prime factorization of 441 is the product of these prime divisors. 441 = 3 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 7 ⋅ 7 Use exponents. 441 = 3 2 ⋅ 7 2 Example 3.31.  Find the prime factorization of 31. The number 31 is a prime number Practice Set C Find the prime factorization of each whole number. Exercise 3.4.16. (Go to Solution) 22 Exercise 3.4.17. (Go to Solution) 40 Exercise 3.4.18.
