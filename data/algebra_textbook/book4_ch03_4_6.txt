Prime and Composite Numbers Notice that the only factors of 7 are 1 and 7 itself, and that the only factors of 3 are 1 and 3 itself. However, the number 8 has the factors 1, 2, 4, and 8, and the number 10 has the factors 1, 2, 5, and 10. Thus, we can see that a whole number can have only two factors (itself and 1) and another whole number can have several factors. We can use this observation to make a useful classification for whole numbers: prime numbers and composite numbers. Prime Number A whole number (greater than one) whose only factors are itself and 1 is called a prime number. The Number 1 is Not a Prime Number The first seven prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17. Notice that the whole number 1 is not considered to be a prime number, and the whole number 2 is the first prime and the only even prime number. Composite Number A whole number composed of factors other than itself and 1 is called a compos­ite number. Composite numbers are not prime numbers. Some composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 15. Sample Set B Determine which whole numbers are prime and which are composite. Example 3.27.  39. Since 3 divides into 39, the number 39 is composite: 39÷3 = 13 Example 3.28.  47. A few division trials will assure us that 47 is only divisible by 1 and 47. Therefore, 47 is prime.
