 || If the Coefficient of x2 is Not 1 First divide through by the coefficient, then proceed with completing the square. Example:   Given Equation: Divide through by coefficient of x2: (in this case a 2) Move constant to other side: Add new constant term: (the square of half the coefficient of x, in this case 9/16): Write as a binomial squared: (the constant in the binomial is half the coefficient of x) Square root both sides: (remember to use plus-or-minus) Solve for x:                  Thus               x = ½  or  x = -2  ||
