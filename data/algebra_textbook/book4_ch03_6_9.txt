Finding the Least Common Multiple Finding the LCM To find the LCM of two or more numbers: Write the prime factorization of each number, using exponents on repeated factors. Write each base that appears in each of the prime factorizations. To each base, attach the largest exponent that appears on it in the prime factorizations. The LCM is the product of the numbers found in step 3. There are some major differences between using the processes for obtaining the GCF and the LCM that we must note carefully: The Difference Between the Processes for Obtaining the GCF and the LCM Notice the difference between step 2 for the LCM and step 2 for the GCF. For the GCF, we use only the bases that are common in the prime factorizations, whereas for the LCM, we use each base that appears in the prime factorizations. Notice the difference between step 3 for the LCM and step 3 for the GCF. For the GCF, we attach the smallest exponents to the common bases, whereas for the LCM, we attach the largest exponents to the bases. Sample Set C Find the LCM of the following numbers. Example 3.36.  9 and 12 The bases that appear in the prime factorizations are 2 and 3. The largest exponents appearing on 2 and 3 in the prime factorizations are, respectively, 2 and 2: 22 from 12. 32 from 9. The LCM is the product of these numbers. LCM = 22⋅32 = 4⋅9 = 36 Thus, 36 is the smallest number that both 9 and 12 divide into without remainders. Example 3.37.  90 and 630 The bases that appear in the prime factorizations are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The largest exponents that appear on 2, 3, 5, and 7 are, respectively, 1, 2, 1, and 1: 21 from either 90 or 630. 32 from either 90 or 630. 51 from either 90 or 630. 71 from 630. The LCM is the product of these numbers. LCM = 2⋅32⋅5⋅7 = 2⋅9⋅5⋅7 = 630 Thus, 630 is the smallest number that both 90 and 630 divide into with no remainders. Example 3.38.  33, 110, and 484 The bases that appear in the prime factorizations are 2, 3, 5, and 11. The largest exponents that appear on 2, 3, 5, and 11 are, respectively, 2, 1, 1, and 2: 22 from 484. 31 from 33. 51 from 110 112 from 484. The LCM is the product of these numbers. Thus, 7260 is the smallest number that 33, 110, and 484 divide into without remainders. Practice Set C Find the LCM of the following numbers. Exercise 3.6.11.
