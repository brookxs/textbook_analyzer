Cube Roots The cube root The number that, when used as a factor with itself three times, yields the original number; it is denoted with the symbol   √ 3 . of a number is that number that when multiplied by itself three times yields the original number. Furthermore, we denote a cube root using the symbol   √ 3 , where 3 is called the index The positive integer n in the notation   √ n that is used to indicate an nth root. . For example, The product of three equal factors will be positive if the factor is positive and negative if the factor is negative. For this reason, any real number will have only one real cube root. Hence the technicalities associated with the principal root do not apply. For example, In general, given any real number a, we have the following property: When simplifying cube roots, look for factors that are perfect cubes.   Example 3: Find the cube root. a. 27 − − √ 3 b. 64 − − √ 3 c. 0 √ 3 d. 1 8 − − √ 3 Solution: a. 27 − − √ 3 = 3 3 − − √ 3 = 3 b. 64 − − √ 3 = 4 3 − − √ 3 = 4 c. 0 √ 3 = 0 3 − − √ 3 = 0 d. 1 8 − − √ 3 = ( 1 2 ) 3 − − − − √ 3 = 1 2   Example 4: Find the cube root. a. − 8 − − − √ 3 b. − 1 − − − √ 3 c. − 1 27 − − − − √ 3 Solution: a. − 8 − − − √ 3 = ( − 2 ) 3 − − − − − √ 3 = − 2 b. − 1 − − − √ 3 = ( − 1 ) 3 − − − − − √ 3 = − 1 c. − 1 27 − − − − √ 3 = ( − 1 3 ) 3 − − − − − − √ 3 = − 1 3 It may be the case that the radicand is not a perfect cube. If an integer is not a perfect cube, then its cube root will be irrational. For example, 2 √ 3 is an irrational number which can be approximated on most calculators using the root button. Depending on the calculator, we typically type in the index prior to pushing the button and then the radicand as follows: Therefore, we have Cube Roots The cube root The number that, when used as a factor with itself three times, yields the original number; it is denoted with the symbol   √ 3 . of a number is that number that when multiplied by itself three times yields the original number.
