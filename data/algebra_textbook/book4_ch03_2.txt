 || Exponential Notation Exponential Notation We have noted that multiplication is a description of repeated addition. Exponen­tial notation is a description of repeated multiplication. Suppose we have the repeated multiplication 8 ⋅ 8 ⋅ 8 ⋅ 8 ⋅ 8 Exponent The factor 8 is repeated 5 times. Exponential notation uses a superscript for the number of times the factor is repeated. The superscript is placed on the repeated factor, 8 5 , in this case. The superscript is called an exponent. The Function of an Exponent An exponent records the number of identical factors that are repeated in a multiplication. Sample Set A Write the following multiplication using exponents. Example 3.1.  3⋅3. Since the factor 3 appears 2 times, we record this as 32 Example 3.2.  62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62. Since the factor 62 appears 9 times, we record this as 629 Expand (write without exponents) each number. Example 3.3.  124 . The exponent 4 is recording 4 factors of 12 in a multiplication. Thus, 124 = 12⋅12⋅12⋅12 Example 3.4.  7063 . The exponent 3 is recording 3 factors of 706 in a multiplication. Thus, 7063 = 706⋅706⋅706 Practice Set A Write the following using exponents.

Exponent, Power 5 is called the exponent, or power. 85 is read as "eight to the fifth power," or more simply as "eight to the fifth," or "the fifth power of eight." Squared When a whole number is raised to the second power, it is said to be squared. The number 52 can be read as 5 to the second power, or 5 to the second, or 5 squared. Cubed When a whole number is raised to the third power, it is said to be cubed. The number 53 can be read as 5 to the third power, or 5 to the third, or 5 cubed. When a whole number is raised to the power of 4 or higher, we simply say that that number is raised to that particular power. The number 58 can be read as 5 to the eighth power, or just 5 to the eighth.  || Roots In the English language, the word "root" can mean a source of something. In mathematical terms, the word "root" is used to indicate that one number is the source of another number through repeated multiplication. Square Root We know that 49 = 72 , that is, 49 = 7⋅7. Through repeated multiplication, 7 is the source of 49. Thus, 7 is a root of 49. Since two 7's must be multiplied together to produce 49, the 7 is called the second or square root of 49. Cube Root We know that 8 = 23 , that is, 8 = 2⋅2⋅2. Through repeated multiplication, 2 is the source of 8. Thus, 2 is a root of 8. Since three 2's must be multiplied together to produce 8, 2 is called the third or cube root of 8. We can continue this way to see such roots as fourth roots, fifth roots, sixth roots, and so on.  || Reading Root Notation There is a symbol used to indicate roots of a number. It is called the radical sign The Radical Sign The symbol is called a radical sign and indicates the nth root of a number. We discuss particular roots using the radical sign as follows: Square Root indicates the square root of the number under the radical sign. It is customary to drop the 2 in the radical sign when discussing square roots. The symbol is understood to be the square root radical sign. = 7 since 7⋅7 = 72 = 49 Cube Root indicates the cube root of the number under the radical sign. since 2⋅2⋅2 = 23 = 8 Fourth Root indicates the fourth root of the number under the radical sign. since 3⋅3⋅3⋅3 = 34 = 81 In an expression such as Radical Sign is called the radical sign. Index 5 is called the index. (The index describes the indicated root.) Radicand 32 is called the radicand. Radical is called a radical (or radical expression). Sample Set B Find each root. Example 3.5.  To determine the square root of 25, we ask, "What whole number squared equals 25?" From our experience with multiplication, we know this number to be 5. Thus, Check: 5 ⋅ 5 = 5 2 = 25 Example 3.6.  To determine the fifth root of 32, we ask, "What whole number raised to the fifth power equals 32?" This number is 2. Check: 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 = 2 5 = 32 Practice Set B Find the following roots using only a knowledge of multiplication. Exercise 3.2.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 3.2.8. (Go to Solution) Exercise 3.2.9.
