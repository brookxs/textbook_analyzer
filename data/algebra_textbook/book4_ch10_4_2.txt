Geometric Definition of Absolute Value Absolute Value-Geometric Approach Geometric definition of absolute value: The absolute value of a number a , denoted ∣ a ∣ , is the distance from a to 0 on the number line. Absolute value answers the question of "how far," and not "which way." The phrase "how far" implies "length" and length is always a nonnegative quantity. Thus, the absolute value of a number is a nonnegative number. Sample Set A Determine each value. Example 10.14.  ∣ 4 ∣ = 4 Example 10.15.  ∣ − 4 ∣ = 4 Example 10.16.  ∣ 0 ∣ = 0 Example 10.17.  − ∣ 5 ∣ = − 5. The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as "negative the absolute value of 5." The absolute value of 5 is 5. Hence, negative the absolute value of 5 is -5. Example 10.18.  − ∣ − 3 ∣ = − 3. The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as "negative the absolute value of -3." The absolute value of -3 is 3. Hence, negative the absolute value of -3 is – ( 3 ) = – 3 . Practice Set A By reasoning geometrically, determine each absolute value. Exercise 10.4.1. (Go to Solution) ∣ 7 ∣ Exercise 10.4.2.
