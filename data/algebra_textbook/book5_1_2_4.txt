Evaluating Algebraic Expressions Variable. A variable is a symbol (usually a letter) that stands for an unknown value that may vary. Let’s add the definition of an algebraic expression. Algebraic Expression. When we combine numbers and variables in a valid way, using operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, the resulting combination of mathematical symbols is called an algebraic expression. Thus, 2a, x+ 5, and y2, being formed by a combination of numbers, variables, and mathematical oper- ators, are valid algebraic expressions. An algebraic expression must be well-formed. For example, 2 +−5x is not a valid expression because there is no term following the plus sign (it is not valid to write +− with nothing between these operators). Similarly, 2 + 3(2 is not well-formed because parentheses are not balanced. In this section we will evaluate algebraic expressions for given values of the variables contained in the expressions. Here are some simple tips to help you be successful. Tips for Evaluating Algebraic Expressions. 22 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS 1. Replace all occurrences of variables in the expression with open paren- theses. Leave room between the parentheses to substitute the given value of the variable. 2. Substitute the given values of variables in the open parentheses prepared in the first step. 3. Evaluate the resulting expression according to the Rules Guiding Order of Operations. You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Evaluate the expression x2 − 2xy + y2 at x = −3 and y = 2.If x = −2 and y = −1, evaluate x3 − y3. Solution. Following Tips for Evaluating Algebraic Expressions, first replace all occurrences of variables in the expression x2− 2xy+ y2 with open parentheses. Next, substitute the given values of variables (−3 for x and 2 for y) in the open parentheses. x2 − 2xy + y2 = ( )2 − 2( )( ) + ( )2 = (−3)2 − 2(−3)(2) + (2)2 Finally, follow the Rules Guiding Order of Operations to evaluate the resulting expression. x2 − 2xy + y2 Original expression. = ( )2 − 2( )( ) + ( )2 Replace variables with parentheses. = (−3)2 − 2(−3)(2) + (2)2 Substitute −3 for x and 2 for y. = 9− 2(−3)(2) + 4 Evaluate exponents first. = 9− (−6)(2) + 4 Left to right, multiply: 2(−3) = −6 = 9− (−12) + 4 Left to right, multiply: (−6)(2) = −12 = 9 + 12 + 4 Add the opposite. = 25 Add. Thus, if x = −3 and y = 2, then x2 − 2xy + y2 = 25.Answer: −7 ! Evaluating Algebraic Expressions Variable. A variable is a symbol (usually a letter) that stands for an unknown value that may vary.
