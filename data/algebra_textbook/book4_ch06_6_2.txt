The Logic Behind the Method Consider the product of 3.2 and 1.46. Changing each decimal to a fraction, we have Thus, (3.2)(1.46) = 4.672. Notice that the factor Using this observation, we can suggest that the sum of the number of decimal places in the factors equals the number of decimal places in the product.
