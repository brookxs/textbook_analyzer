 || Independent and Dependent Variables Independent and Dependent Variables In an equation, any variable whose value can be freely assigned is said to be an independent variable. Any variable whose value is determined once the other values have been assigned is said to be a dependent variable. Two examples will help illustrate these concepts. Consider the equation y = 2x − 7 . If we are free to choose values for x , then x would be considered the independent variable. Since the value of y depends on the value of x , y would be the dependent variable. Consider the equation m = − 4g k 2 . If we are free to choose values for both g and k , then g and k would be considered independent variables. Since the value of m depends on the values chosen for g and k , m would be the dependent variable.  || The Domain of an Equation Domain The process of replacing letters with numbers is called numerical evaluation. The collection of numbers that can replace the independent variable in an equation and yield a meaningful result is called the domain of the equation. The domain of an equation may be the entire collection of real numbers or may be restricted to some subcollection of the real numbers. The restrictions may be due to particular applications of the equation or to problems of computability.  ||
