An Ordered Set The real numbers have the property that they are ordered, which means that given any two different numbers we can always say that one is greater or less than the other. A more formal way of saying this is: For any two real numbers a and b, one and only one of the following three statements is true: 1.      a is less than b, (expressed as a < b) 2.      a is equal to b, (expressed as a = b) 3.      a is greater than b, (expressed as a > b) An Ordered Set The real numbers have the property that they are ordered, which means that given any two different numbers we can always say that one is greater or less than the other.
