Calculators Calculators can be useful for finding quotients of decimal numbers. As we have seen with the other calculator operations, we can sometimes expect only approximate results. We are alerted to approximate results when the calculator display is filled with digits. We know it is possible that the operation may produce more digits than the calculator has the ability to show. For example, the multiplication produces 5 + 4 = 9 decimal places. An eight-digit display calculator only has the ability to show eight digits, and an approximation results. The way to recognize a possible approximation is illustrated in problem 3 of the next sample set. Sample Set C Find each quotient using a calculator. If the result is an approximation, round to five decimal places. Example 6.49.  12.596÷4.7 Table 6.30.     Display Reads Type 12.596 12.596 Press ÷ 12.596 Type 4.7 4.7 Press = 2.68 Since the display is not filled, we expect this to be an accurate result. Example 6.50.  0.5696376÷0.00123 Table 6.31.     Display Reads Type .5696376 0.5696376 Press ÷ 0.5696376 Type .00123 0.00123 Press = 463.12 Since the display is not filled, we expect this result to be accurate. Example 6.51.  0.8215199÷4.113 Table 6.32.     Display Reads Type .8215199 0.8215199 Press ÷ 0.8215199 Type 4.113 4.113 Press = 0.1997373 There are EIGHT DIGITS — DISPLAY FILLED! BE AWARE OF POSSIBLE APPROXI­MATIONS. We can check for a possible approximation in the following way. Since the division can be checked by multiplying 4 and 3, we can check our division by performing the multiplication This multiplication produces 3 + 7 = 10 decimal digits. But our suspected quotient contains only 8 decimal digits. We conclude that the answer is an approximation. Then, rounding to five decimal places, we get 0.19974. Practice Set C Find each quotient using a calculator. If the result is an approximation, round to four decimal places. Exercise 6.7.12. (Go to Solution) 42.49778÷14.261 Exercise 6.7.13.
