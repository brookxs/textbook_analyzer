 || The Logic Behind the Method Consider the product of 3.2 and 1.46. Changing each decimal to a fraction, we have Thus, (3.2)(1.46) = 4.672. Notice that the factor Using this observation, we can suggest that the sum of the number of decimal places in the factors equals the number of decimal places in the product.  || The Method of Multiplying Decimals Method of Multiplying Decimals To multiply decimals, Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Find the sum of the number of decimal places in the factors. The number of decimal places in the product is the sum found in step 2. Sample Set A Find the following products. Example 6.31.  6.5 ⋅ 4.3 Thus, 6.5⋅4.3 = 27.95. Example 6.32.  23.4⋅1.96 Thus, 23.4⋅1.96 = 45.864. Example 6.33.  Find the product of 0.251 and 0.00113 and round to three decimal places. Now, rounding to three decimal places, we get Practice Set A Find the following products. Exercise 6.6.1. (Go to Solution) 5.3⋅ 8.6 Exercise 6.6.2. (Go to Solution) 2.12⋅ 4.9 Exercise 6.6.3. (Go to Solution) 1.054 ⋅ 0.16 Exercise 6.6.4. (Go to Solution) 0.00031 ⋅ 0.002 Exercise 6.6.5. (Go to Solution) Find the product of 2.33 and 4.01 and round to one decimal place. Exercise 6.6.6. (Go to Solution) 10 ⋅ 5.394 Exercise 6.6.7. (Go to Solution) 100 ⋅ 5.394 Exercise 6.6.8. (Go to Solution) 1000⋅ 5.394 Exercise 6.6.9. (Go to Solution) 10,000 ⋅ 5.394  || Calculators Calculators can be used to find products of decimal numbers. However, a calculator that has only an eight-digit display may not be able to handle numbers or products that result in more than eight digits. But there are plenty of inexpensive ($50 - $75) calculators with more than eight-digit displays. Sample Set B Find the following products, if possible, using a calculator. Example 6.34.  2.58 ⋅ 8.61 Table 6.18.     Display Reads Type 2.58 2.58 Press × 2.58 Type 8.61 8.61 Press = 22.2138 The product is 22.2138. Example 6.35.  0.006 ⋅ 0.0042 Table 6.19.     Display Reads Type .006 .006 Press × .006 Type .0042 0.0042 Press = 0.0000252 We know that there will be seven decimal places in the product (since 3 + 4 = 7). Since the display shows 7 decimal places, we can assume the product is correct. Thus, the product is 0.0000252. Example 6.36.  0.0026 ⋅ 0.11976 Since we expect 4 + 5 = 9 decimal places in the product, we know that an eight-digit display calculator will not be able to provide us with the exact value. To obtain the exact value, we must use "hand technology." Suppose, however, that we agree to round off this product to three decimal places. We then need only four decimal places on the display. Table 6.20.     Display Reads Type .0026 .0026 Press × .0026 Type .11976 0.11976 Press = 0.0003114 Rounding 0.0003114 to three decimal places we get 0.000. Thus, 0.0026 ⋅ 0.11976 = 0.000 to three decimal places. Practice Set B Use a calculator to find each product. If the calculator will not provide the exact product, round the result to four decimal places. Exercise 6.6.10. (Go to Solution) 5.126 ⋅ 4.08 Exercise 6.6.11. (Go to Solution) 0.00165 ⋅ 0.04 Exercise 6.6.12. (Go to Solution) 0.5598 ⋅ 0.4281 Exercise 6.6.13. (Go to Solution) 0.000002 ⋅ 0.06  || Multiplying Decimals by Powers of 10 There is an interesting feature of multiplying decimals by powers of 10. Consider the following multiplications. Table 6.21. Multiplication Number of Zeros in the Power of 10 Number of Positions the Decimal Point Has Been Moved to the Right 10 ⋅ 8 . 315274 = 83 . 15274 1 1 100 ⋅ 8 . 315274 = 831 . 5274 2 2 1, 000 ⋅ 8 . 315274 = 8, 315 . 274 3 3 10 , 000 ⋅ 8 . 315274 = 83 , 152 . 74 4 4 Multiplying a Decimal by a Power of 10 To multiply a decimal by a power of 10, move the decimal place to the right of its current position as many places as there are zeros in the power of 10. Add zeros if necessary. Sample Set C Find the following products. Example 6.37.  100⋅34.876. Since there are 2 zeros in 100, Move the decimal point in 34.876 two places to the right. Example 6.38.  1,000⋅4.8058. Since there are 3 zeros in 1,000, move the decimal point in 4.8058 three places to the right. Example 6.39.  10,000⋅56.82. Since there are 4 zeros in 10,000, move the decimal point in 56.82 four places to the right. We will have to add two zeros in order to obtain the four places. Since there is no fractional part, we can drop the decimal point. Example 6.40.  Example 6.41.  Practice Set C Find the following products. Exercise 6.6.14. (Go to Solution) 100 ⋅ 4.27 Exercise 6.6.15. (Go to Solution) 10,000 ⋅ 16.52187 Exercise 6.6.16. (Go to Solution) (10)(0.0188) Exercise 6.6.17. (Go to Solution) (10,000,000,000)(52.7)  || Multiplication in Terms of “Of” Recalling that the word "of" translates to the arithmetic operation of multiplica­tion, let's observe the following multiplications. Sample Set D Example 6.42.  Find 4.1 of 3.8. Translating "of" to "×", we get Thus, 4.1 of 3.8 is 15.58. Example 6.43.  Find 0.95 of the sum of 2.6 and 0.8. We first find the sum of 2.6 and 0.8. Now find 0.95 of 3.4 Thus, 0.95 of (2.6 + 0.8) is 3.230. Practice Set D Exercise 6.6.18. (Go to Solution) Find 2.8 of 6.4. Exercise 6.6.19. (Go to Solution) Find 0.1 of 1.3. Exercise 6.6.20. (Go to Solution) Find 1.01 of 3.6. Exercise 6.6.21. (Go to Solution) Find 0.004 of 0.0009. Exercise 6.6.22. (Go to Solution) Find 0.83 of 12. Exercise 6.6.23. (Go to Solution) Find 1.1 of the sum of 8.6 and 4.2.  ||
