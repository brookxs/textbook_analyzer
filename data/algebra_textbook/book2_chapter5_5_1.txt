Dividing by a Monomial Recall the quotient rule for exponents: if x is nonzero and m and n are positive integers, then In other words, when dividing two expressions with the same base, subtract the exponents. This rule applies when dividing a monomial by a monomial. In this section, we will assume that all variables in the denominator are nonzero.   Example 1: Divide: 28 y 3 7 y . Solution: Divide the coefficients and subtract the exponents of the variable y. Answer: 4 y 2   Example 2: Divide: 24 x 7 y 5 8 x 3 y 2 . Solution: Divide the coefficients and apply the quotient rule by subtracting the exponents of the like bases. Answer: 3 x 4 y 3   When dividing a polynomial by a monomial, we may treat the monomial as a common denominator and break up the fraction using the following property: Applying this property results in terms that can be treated as quotients of monomials.   Example 3: Divide: − 5 x 4 + 25 x 3 − 15 x 2 5 x 2 . Solution: Break up the fraction by dividing each term in the numerator by the monomial in the denominator and then simplify each term. Answer: − x 2 + 5 x − 3   Check your division by multiplying the answer, the quotient The result after dividing. , by the monomial in the denominator, the divisor The denominator of a quotient. , to see if you obtain the original numerator, the dividend The numerator of a quotient. .   Example 4: Divide: 9 a 4 b − 7 a 3 b 2 + 3 a 2 b − 3 a 2 b . Solution: Answer: − 3 a 2 + 7 3 a b − 1 . The check is optional and is left to the reader.   Try this! Divide: ( 16 x 5 − 8 x 4 + 5 x 3 + 2 x 2 ) ÷ ( 2 x 2 ) . Answer: 8 x 3 − 4 x 2 + 5 2 x + 1 Video Solution Dividing by a Monomial Recall the quotient rule for exponents: if x is nonzero and m and n are positive integers, then In other words, when dividing two expressions with the same base, subtract the exponents.
