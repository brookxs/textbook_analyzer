Simple And Complex Fractions Simple Fraction In Section Section 8.2 we saw that a simple fraction was a fraction of the form where P and Q are polynomials and Q ≠ 0 . Complex Fraction A complex fraction is a fraction in which the numerator or denominator, or both, is a fraction. The fractions are examples of complex fractions, or more generally, complex rational expressions. There are two methods for simplifying complex rational expressions: the combine-divide method and the LCD-multiply-divide method.
