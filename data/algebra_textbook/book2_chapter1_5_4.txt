Decimals and Fractions to Percents To convert a decimal to a percent, convert the decimal to a fraction of 100 and apply the definition of percent, or equivalently, move the decimal to the right two places and add a percent sign.   Example 10: Convert 0.23 to a percent. Solution: First, convert the decimal to a fraction of 100 and apply the definition. You can achieve the same result by moving the decimal two places to the right and adding a percent sign. Answer: 23%.   Alternatively, you can multiply by 1 in the form of 100%.   Example 11: Convert 2.35 to a percent. Solution: Recall that 1 = 100%. You can achieve the same result by moving the decimal two places to the right and adding a percent sign. Answer: 235%   Example 12: Convert 5 1 5 to a percent. Solution: Answer: 520%   Sometimes we can use the definition of percent and find an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 100.   Example 13: Convert 13 25 to a percent. Solution: Notice that the denominator 25 is a factor of 100. Use the definition of percent by finding an equivalent fraction with 100 in the denominator. Answer: 52%   This is a very specialized technique because 100 may not be a multiple of the denominator.   Example 14: Convert 1 3 to a percent. Solution: Notice that the denominator 3 is not a factor of 100. In this case, it is best to multiply by 1 in the form of 100%. Answer: 33 1 3 %   Try this! Convert to a percent: 2 3 .
