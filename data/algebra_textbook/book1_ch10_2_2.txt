Standard Form of A Quadratic Equation In Chapter (Section 5.1) we studied linear equations in one and two variables and methods for solving them. We observed that a linear equation in one variable was any equation that could be written in the form a x + b = 0, a ≠ 0, and a linear equation in two variables was any equation that could be written in the form a x + b y = c, where a and b are not both 0. We now wish to study quadratic equations in one variable. Quadratic Equation A quadratic equation is an equation of the form a x 2 + b x + c = 0, a ≠ 0. The standard form of the quadratic equation is a x 2 + b x + c = 0, a ≠ 0. For a quadratic equation in standard form a x 2 + b x + c = 0, a is the coefficient of x 2 . b is the coefficient of x. c is the constant term.
