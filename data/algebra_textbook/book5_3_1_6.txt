Using the TABLE Feature of the Graphing Calculator As the equations become more complicated, it can become quite tedious to create tables of points that satisfy the equation. Fortunately, the graphing calculator has a TABLE feature that enables you to easily construct tables of points that satisfy the given equation. 3.1. GRAPHING EQUATIONS BY HAND 161 You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Use the graphing calculator to help create a table of points that satisfy the equation y = x2−7. Plot the points in your table. If you don’t feel that there is enough evidence to envision what the final shape of the graph will be, use the calculator to add more points to your table and plot them. Continue this process until your are convinced of the final shape of the graph. Figure 3.10: The graphing calculator. Solution: The first step is to load the equation y = x2− 7 into the Y= menu of the graphing calculator. The topmost row of buttons on your calculator (see Figure 3.10) have the following appearance: Y= WINDOW ZOOM TRACE GRAPH Pressing the Y= button opens the Y= menu shown in Figure 3.11. Use the up-and-down arrow keys (see Figure 3.13) to move the cursor after Y1= in the Y= menu, then use the following keystrokes to enter the equation y = x2 − 7. The result is shown in Figure 3.12. X,T, θ, n ∧ 2 − 7 ENTER Figure 3.11: Opening the Y= menu. Figure 3.12: Entering the equation y = x2 − 7. The next step is to “set up” the table. First, note that the calculator has symbolism printed on its case above each of its buttons. Above the WINDOW button you’ll note the phrase TBLSET. Note that it is in the same color as the 2ND button. Thus, to open the setup window for the table, enter the following keystrokes. Figure 3.13: Arrow keys move the cursor. 2ND WINDOW Set TblStart (see Figure 3.14) equal to the first x-value you want to see in your table. In this case, enter −4 after TblStart. Set &Tbl to the increment you want for your x-values. In this case, set &Tbl equal to 1. Finally, set 162 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING both the independent and dependent variables to “automatic.” In each case, use the arrow keys to highlight the word AUTO and press ENTER. The result is shown in Figure 3.14. Next, note the word TABLE above the GRAPH button is in the same color as the 2ND key. To open the TABLE, enter the following keystrokes. 2ND GRAPH The result is shown in Figure 3.15. Note that you can use the up-and-down arrow keys to scroll through the table. Figure 3.14: Opening the TBLSET menu. Figure 3.15: Table of points satis- fying y = x2 − 7. Next, enter the results from your calculator’s table into a table on a sheet of graph paper, then plot the points in the table. The results are shown in Figure 3.16. x y = x2 − 7 (x, y) −4 9 (−4, 9) −3 2 (−3, 2) −2 −3 (−2,−3) −1 −6 (−1,−6) 0 −7 (0,−7) 1 −6 (1,−6) 2 −3 (2,−3) 3 2 (3, 2) 4 9 (4, 9) −10 10 −10 10 x y Figure 3.16: Plotting nine points that satisfy the equation y = x2 − 7. In Figure 3.16, the eventual shape of the graph of y = x2 − 7 may be evident already, but let’s add a few more points to our table and plot them. Open the 3.1. GRAPHING EQUATIONS BY HAND 163 table “setup” window again by pressing 2ND WINDOW. Set TblStart to −4 again, then set the increment &Tbl to 0.5. The result is shown in Figure 3.17. Figure 3.17: Set&Tbl equal to 0.5. Figure 3.18: More points satisfying y = x2 − 7. Add these new points to the table on your graph paper and plot them (see Figure 3.19). x y = x2 − 7 (x, y) −3.5 5.25 (−3.5, 5.25) −2.5 −0.75 (−2.5,−0.75) −1.5 −4.75 (−1.5,−4.75) −0.5 −6.75 (−0.5,−6.75) 0.5 −6.75 (0.5,−6.75) 1.5 −4.75 (1.5,−4.75) 2.5 −0.75 (2.5,−0.75) 3.5 5.25 (3.5, 5.25) −10 10 −10 10 x y Figure 3.19: Adding additional points to the graph of y = x2 − 7. There are an infinite number of points that satisfy the equation y = x2− 7. In Figure 3.19, we’ve plotted only 17 points that satisfy the equation y = x2 − 7. However, the collection of points in Figure 3.19 suggest that if we were to plot the remainder of the points that satisfy the equation y = x2 − 7, the result would be the curve (called a parabola) shown in Figure 3.20. 164 CHAPTER 3.
