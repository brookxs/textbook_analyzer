Factoring Completely Sometimes after one pass at factoring, factors remain that can be factored further. You must continue to factor in this case. You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Factor: x4 − 16Factor: x4 − 81 Solution: In x4 − 16, we have the difference of two squares: (x2)2 = x4 and 42 = 16. First, we take the square roots, then separate one set with a plus sign and the other set with a minus sign. x4 − 16 = (x2 + 4)(x2 − 4) 6.5. FACTORING SPECIAL FORMS 447 Note that x2+4 is the sum of two squares and does not factor further. However, x2 − 4 is the difference of two squares. Take the square roots, x and 2, then separate one set with a plus sign and the other set with a minus sign. = (x2 + 4)(x+ 2)(x− 2) Done. We cannot factor further. Answer: (x2 + 9)(x+ 3)(x− 3) !
