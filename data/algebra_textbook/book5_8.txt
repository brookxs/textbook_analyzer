QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS  || 8.1 Introduction to Radical Notation We know how to square a number. For example: • 52 = 25 • (−5)2 = 25 Taking the square root of a number is the opposite of squaring. • The nonnegative square root of 25 is 5. • The negative square root of 25 is −5. Thus, when searching for a square root of a number, we are searching for number whose square is equal to our number. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Find the square roots of 81.Find the square roots of 64. Solution: We are looking for a number whose square is 81. • Because 92 = 81, the nonnegative square root of 81 is 9. • Because (−9)2 = 81, the negative square root of 81 is −9. Hence, 81 has two square roots, −9 and 9.Answer: 8 and −8 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Find the square roots of 0.Find the square roots of 100. Solution: We are looking for a number whose square is 0. • Because 02 = 0, the nonnegative square root of 0 is 0. No other number squared will equal zero. Hence, zero has exactly one square root, namely zero.Answer: 10 and −10 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Find the square roots of −36.Find the square roots of −25. 8.1. INTRODUCTION TO RADICAL NOTATION 537 Solution: We are looking for a number whose square is −36. However, every time you square a real number, the result is never negative. Hence, −36 has no real square roots.1 Answer: no real square roots ! The introductions in Examples 1, 2, and 3 lead to the following definition. Defining the square roots of a number. The solutions of x2 = a are called square roots of a. Case: a > 0. The equation x2 = a has two real solutions, namely x = ±√a. • The notation √a calls for the nonegative square root. • The notation −√a calls for the negative square root. Case: a = 0. The equation x2 = 0 has exactly one solution, namely x = 0. Case: a < 0. The equation x2 = a has no real solutions. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve x2 = 9 for x, then simplify your answers. Solve x2 = 16 for x, then simplify your answers. Solution: Because the right-hand side of x2 = 9 is positive, the equation has two solutions. x2 = 9 Original equation. x = ±√9 Two answers: −√9 and √9 To simplify these answers, we need to understand the following facts: • √9 calls for the nonnegative square root of 9. Because (3)2 = 9, the nonnegative square root of 9 is 3. Hence, √ 9 = 3. • −√9 calls for the negative square root of 9. Because (−3)2 = 9, the negative square root of 9 is −3. Hence, −√9 = −3. Thus, the solutions of x2 = 9 are x = ±3, which is equivalent to saying “x = −3 or x = 3.” Answer: 4, −4 ! 1When we say that −36 has no real square roots, we mean there are no real numbers that are square roots of −36. The reason we emphasize the word real in this situation is the fact that −36 does have two square roots that are elements of the complex numbers, a set of numbers that are usually introduced in advanced courses such as college algebra or trigonometry. 538 CHAPTER 8.

Solution: There is only one number whose square equals 0, namely 0. x2 = 0 Original equation. x = 0 One answer: (0)2 = 0. Thus, the only solution of x2 = 0 is x = 0. Consequently, the nonnegative square root of zero is zero. Hence, √ 0 = 0.Answer: 7, −7 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Solve x2 = −4 for x, then simplify the answer.Solve x2 = −9 for x, then simplify the answers. Solution: You cannot square a real number and get a negative result. Hence, x2 = −4 has no real solutions. Therefore, √−4 is not a real number.Answer: no real solutions ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Simplify each of the following:Simplify: −√144 a) √ 121 b) −√225 c) √−100 d) −√324 Solution: Remember, the notation √ a calls for the nonnegative square root of a, while the notation −√a calls for the negative square root of a. a) Because 112 = 121, the nonnegative square root of 121 is 11. Thus: √ 121 = 11 b) Because (−15)2 = 225, the negative square root of 225 is −15. Thus: −√225 = −15 c) You cannot square a real number and get −100. Therefore, √−100 is not a real number. d) Because (−18)2 = 324, the negative square root of 324 is −18. Thus: −√324 = −18Answer: −12 ! 8.1. INTRODUCTION TO RADICAL NOTATION 539 Squaring “undoes” taking the square root. Squaring square roots. If a > 0, then both −√a and √a are solutions of x2 = a. Consequently, if we substitute each of them into the equation x2 = a, we get: (−√a)2 = a and (√a)2 = a You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Simplify each of the following expressions: Simplify: (−√21)2 a) ( √ 5)2 b) (−√7)2 c) (√−11)2 Solution: We’ll handle each case carefully. a) Because √ 5 is a solution of x2 = 5, if we square √ 5, we should get 5. ( √ 5)2 = 5 b) Because −√7 is a solution of x2 = 7, if we square −√7, we should get 7. (−√7)2 = 7 c) Because x2 = −11 has no real answers, √−11 is not a real number. Ad- vanced courses such as college algebra or trigonometry will introduce the complex number system and show how to handle this expression. Answer: 21 !  || Using the Graphing Calculator Up to this point, the equation x2 = a has involved perfect squares. For exam- ple, if we start with x2 = 25, then the solutions are x = ±√25. Because 25 is a perfect square, we can simplify further, arriving at x = ±5. However, the right-hand side of x2 = a does not have to be a perfect square. For example, the equation x2 = 7 has two real solutions, x = ±√7. Because 7 is not a perfect square, we cannot simplify further. In the next example, we’ll use the graphing calculator to compare this algebraic solution with a graphical solution and hopefully provide some assurance that −√7 and √7 are perfectly valid solutions of x2 = 7. 540 CHAPTER 8.

Now we solve the equation algebraically. x2 = 7 x = ±√7 At this point, the question is: “Do these algebraic solutions match the graphical solutions in Figure 8.3?” Let’s use our calculator to compare results.

Because there are no points of intersection, the graph in Figure 8.6 informs us that the equation x2 = −5 has no real solutions. Now we solve the equation algebraically. x2 = −5 However, you cannot square a real number and get a negative answer. Hence, the equation x2 = −5 has no real solutions. This agrees completely with the graph in Figure 8.6. !  || Approximating Square Roots The squares in the “List of Squares” shown in Table 8.1 are called perfect squares. Each is the square of a whole number. But not all numbers are perfect squares. For example, in the case of √ 24, there is no whole number whose square is equal to 24. However, this does not prevent √ 24 from being a perfectly good number. 8.1.

From the “List of Squares,” note that 24 lies betwen 16 and 25, so√ 24 will lie between 4 and 5, with √ 24 much closer to 5 than it is to 4. 4 5 √ 16 √ 25 √ 24 4.8 Let’s guess √ 24 ≈ 4.8. As a check, let’s square 4.8. (4.8)2 = (4.8)(4.8) = 23.04 Not quite 24! Clearly, √ 24 must be a little bit bigger than 4.8. Let’s use a scientific calculator to get a better approximation. From our calculator, using the square root button, we find √ 24 ≈ 4.89897948557. 544 CHAPTER 8. QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS Even though this is better than our estimate of 4.8, it is still only an ap- proximation. Our calculator was only capable of providing 11 decimal places. However, the exact decimal representation of √ 24 is an infinite decimal that never terminates and never establishes a pattern of repetition. Just for fun, here is a decimal approximation of √ 24 that is accurate to 1000 places, courtesy of http://www.wolframalpha.com/. 4.8989794855663561963945681494117827839318949613133402568653851 3450192075491463005307971886620928046963718920245322837824971773 09196755146832515679024745571056578254950553531424952602105418235 40446962621357973381707264886705091208067617617878749171135693149 44872260828854054043234840367660016317961567602617940145738798726 16743161888016008874773750983290293078782900240894528962666325870 21889483627026570990088932343453262850995296636249008023132090729 18018687172335863967331332533818263813071727532210516312358732472 35822058934417670915102576710597966482011173804100128309322482347 06798820862115985796934679065105574720836593103436607820735600767 24633259464660565809954782094852720141025275395093777354012819859 11851434656929005776183028851492605205905926474151050068455119830 90852562596006129344159884850604575685241068135895720093193879959 87119508123342717309306912496416512553772738561882612744867017729 60314496926744648947590909762887695867274018394820295570465751182 126319692156620734019070649453 If you were to multiply this number by itself (square the number), you would get a number that is extremely close to 24, but it would not be exactly 24. There would still be a little discrepancy.Answer: 9.1 ! 8.1. INTRODUCTION TO RADICAL NOTATION 545 ! ! !  || 8.2 Simplifying Radical Expressions Let’s begin by comparing two mathematical expressions. √ 9 √ 16 = 3 · 4 = 12 √ 9 · 16 = √144 = 12 Note that both √ 9 √ 16 and √ 9 · 16 equal 12. Hence, √9√16 = √9 · 16. Let’s look at another example. √ 4 √ 9 = 2 · 3 = 6 √ 4 · 9 = √36 = 6 Note that both √ 4 √ 9 and √ 4 · 9 equal 6. Hence, √4√9 = √4 · 9. It appears that a pattern is forming, namely: √ a √ b = √ ab Let’s try an example on our calculator. First enter √ 2 √ 3, then enter √ 2 · 3 (see Figure 8.7). Note that they produce the same result. Therefore, √ 2 √ 3 =√ 2 · 3. Figure 8.7: Note that √ 2 √ 3 = √ 2 · 3. The above discussion leads us to the following result. Multiplication property of radicals.

Simplify each of the following expressions as much as possible: Simplify: √ 2 √ 8 a) √ 3 √ 11 b) √ 12 √ 3 c) √ 2 √ 13 Solution: In each case, use the property √ a √ b = √ ab.

For example: √ 50 = √ 25 √ 2 Factor out a perfect square. = 5 √ 2 Simplify: √ 25 = 5. The expression 5 √ 2 is said to be in simple radical form. Like reducing a fraction to lowest terms, you should always look to factor out a perfect square when possible. Simple radical form. If possible, always factor out a perfect square. You Try It!

Sometimes, after factoring out a perfect square, you can still factor out another perfect square. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Place √ 72 in simple radical form.Place √ 200 in simple radical form.

Alternate solution. We can simplify the process by noting that we can factor out √ 36 from √ 72 to start the process. √ 72 = √ 36 √ 2 Factor out a perfect square. = 6 √ 2 Simplify: √ 36 = 6. Although the second solution is more efficient, the first solution is still math- ematically correct. The point to make here is that we must continue to factor out a perfect square whenever possible. Our answer is not in simple radical form until we can no longer factor out a perfect square. Answer: 10 √ 2 !  || The Pythagorean Theorem An angle that measures 90 degrees is called a right angle. If one of the angles of a triangle is a right angle, then the triangle is called a right triangle. It is traditional to mark the right angle with a little square (see Figure 8.8). A B Cb a c Figure 8.8: Right triangle &ABC has a right angle at vertex C. Right triangle terminology. • The longest side of the right triangle, the side directly opposite the right angle, is called the hypotenuse of the right triangle. • The remaining two sides of the right triangle are called the legs of the right triangle. 550 CHAPTER 8. QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS  || Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem Each side of the square in Figure 8.9 has been divided into two segments, one of length a, the other of length b. a b a b ab a b c c c c Figure 8.9: Proving the Pythagorean Theorem. We can find the total area of the square by squaring any one of the sides of the square. A = (a+ b)2 Square a side to find area. A = a2 + 2ab+ b2 Squaring a binomial pattern. Thus, the total area of the square is A = a2 + 2ab+ b2. A second approach to finding the area of the square is to sum the areas of the geometric parts that make up the square. We have four congruent right triangles, shaded in light red, with base a and height b. The area of each of these triangles is found by taking one-half times the base times the height; i.e., the area of each triangles is (1/2)ab. In the interior, we have a smaller square with side c. Its area is found by squaring its side; i.e., the area of the smaller square is c2. The total area of the square is the sum of its parts, one smaller square and four congruent triangles. That is: A = c2 + 4 ( 1 2 ab ) Adding the area of the interior square and the area of four right triangles. A = c2 + 2ab Simplify: 4((1/2)ab) = 2ab. The two expressions, a2 + 2ab+ b2 and c2 + 2ab, both represent the total area of the large square. Hence, they must be equal to one another. a2 + 2ab+ b2 = c2 + 2ab Each side of this equation represents the area of the large square. a2 + b2 = c2 Subtract 2ab from both sides. 8.2. SIMPLIFYING RADICAL EXPRESSIONS 551 The last equation, a2 + b2 = c2, is called the Pythagorean Theorem. The Pythagorean Theorem. If a and b are the legs of a right triangle and c is its hypotenuse, then: a2 + b2 = c2 We say “The sum of the squares of the legs of a right triangle equals the square of its hypotenuse.” Good hint. Note that the hypotenuse sits by itself on one side of the equation a2 + b2 = c2. The legs of the hypotenuse are on the other side. Let’s put the Pythagorean Theorem to work. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4.

However, in this situation, c represents the length of the hypotenuse and must be a positive number. Hence: c = 5 Nonnegative square root. Thus, the length of the hypotenuse is 5.

We’ll let x represent the length of each leg. 8 x x Use the Pythagorean Theorem, substituting x for each leg and 8 for the hy- potenuse. a2 + b2 = c2 Pythagorean Theorem. x2 + x2 = 82 Substitute: x for a, x for b, 8 for c. 2x2 = 64 Combine like terms: x+ x = 2x. x2 = 32 Divide both sides by 2. The equation x2 = 32 has two real solutions, x = −√32 and x = √32. How- ever, in this situation, x represents the length of each leg and must be a positive number. Hence: x = √ 32 Nonnegative square root. Remember, your final answer must be in simple radical form. We must factor out a perfect square when possible. x = √ 16 √ 2 Factor out a perfect square. x = 4 √ 2 Simplify: √ 16 = 4.

Remember, there are two square roots. x− 1 = ±√3 Finally, add 1 to both sides of the equation. x = 1±√3 Thus, the equation x2 = 2x+ 2 has two answers, x = 1−√3 and x = 1+√3.

A second degree polynomial equation of the form ax2 + bx+ c = 0, where a, b, and c are any real numbers, is called a quadratic equation in x. The goal of this section is to develop a formulaic shortcut that will provide exact solutions of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx+ c = 0. We start by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. ax2 + bx+ c = 0 Quadratic equation. ax2 + bx = −c Subtract c from both sides. In preparation for completing the square, we next divide both sides of the equation by a. x2 + b a x = − c a Divide both sides by a. Now we complete the square. Take one-half of the coefficient of x, then square the result. 1 2 · b a = b 2a when squared gives ( b 2a )2 = b2 4a2 We now add b2/(4a2) to both sides of the equation. x2 + b a x+ b2 4a2 = − c a + b2 4a2 Add b2/(4a2) to both sides. On the left, we factor the perfect square trinomial. On the right, we make equivalent fractions with a common denominator.( x+ b 2a )2 = − c a · 4a 4a + b2 4a2 On the left, factor. On the right, create equivalent fractions with a common denominator.( x+ b 2a )2 = −4ac 4a2 + b2 4a2 Multiply numerators and denominators.( x+ b 2a )2 = b2 − 4ac 4a2 Add fractions. 572 CHAPTER 8. QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS When we take the square root, there are two answers. x+ b 2a = ± √ b2 − 4ac 4a2 Two square roots. When you take the square root of a fraction, you take the square root of both the numerator and denominator. x+ b 2a = ± √ b2 − 4ac√ 4a2 x+ b 2a = ± √ b2 − 4ac 2a Simplify: √ 4a2 = 2a. x = − b 2a ± √ b2 − 4ac 2a Subtract b/(2a) from both sides. Because both fractions have the same denominator, we can add and subtract numerators and put the answer over the common denominator. x = −b±√b2 − 4ac 2a The quadratic formula. The equation ax2 + bx+ c = 0 is called a quadratic equation. Its solutions are given by x = −b±√b2 − 4ac 2a , called the quadratic formula. Whew! Fortunately, the result is a lot easier to apply than it is to develop! Let’s try some examples. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve for x: x2 − 4x− 5 = 0.Solve for x: x2 − 8x+ 12 = 0 Solution: The integer pair 1,−5 has product ac = −5 and sum b = −4. Hence, this trinomial factors. x2 − 4x− 5 = 0 (x+ 1)(x− 5) = 0 Now we can use the zero product property to write: x+ 1 = 0 or x− 5 = 0 x = −1 x = 5 8.4. THE QUADRATIC FORMULA 573 Thus, the solutions are x = −1 and x = 5. Now, let’s give the quadratic formula a try. First, we must compare our equation with the quadratic equation, then determine the values of a, b, and c. ax2 + bx+ c = 0 x2 − 4x− 5 = 0 Comparing equations, we see that a = 1, b = −4, and c = −5. We will now plug these numbers into the quadratic formula. First, replace each occurrence of a, b, and c in the quadratic formula with open parentheses. x = −b±√b2 − 4ac 2a The quadratic formula. x = −( )±√( )2 − 4( )( ) 2( ) Replace a, b, and c with open parentheses. Now we can substitute: 1 for a, −4 for b, and −5 for c. x = −(−4)±√(−4)2 − 4(1)(−5) 2(1) Substitute: 1 for a, −4 for b, and −5 for c. x = 4±√16 + 20 2 Simplify. Exponent first, then multiplication. x = 4±√36 2 Add: 16 + 20 = 36. x = 4± 6 2 Simplify: √ 36 = 6.

Check: Use the calculator to check each solution (see Figure 8.16). Note that in storing (5−√53)/2 in X, we must surround the numerator in parentheses. Figure 8.16: Check (5 −√53)/2 and (5 +√53)/2.

An object is launched vertically and its height y (in feet)An object is launched vertically and its height y (in feet) above ground level is given by the equation y = 160 + 96t− 16t2, where t is the time (in seconds) that has passed since its launch. How much time must pass after the launch before the object returns to ground level? above ground level is given by the equation y = 320+192t−16t2, where t is the time (in seconds) that has passed since its launch. How much time must pass after the launch before the object returns to ground level? After placing the answer in simple form and reducing, use your calculator to round the answer to the nearest tenth of a second. Solution: When the object returns to ground level, its height y above ground level is y = 0 feet. To find the time when this occurs, substitute y = 0 in the formula y = 320 + 192t− 16t2 and solve for t. y = 320 + 192t− 16t2 Original equation. 0 = 320 + 192t− 16t2 Set y = 0.

Arnie gets on his bike at noon and begins to ride due north At 6:00 am, a freight train passes through Sagebrush Junction heading west at 40 miles per hour. At 8:00 am, a passenger train passes through the junction heading south at 60 miles per hour. At what time of the day, correct to the nearest minute, will the two trains be 180 miles apart? at a constant rate of 12 miles per hour. At 1:00 pm, Barbara gets on her bike at the same starting point and begins to ride due east at a constant rate of 8 miles per hour. At what time of the day will they be 50 miles apart (as the crow flies)? Don’t worry about simple form, just report the time of day, correct to the nearest minute. Solution: At the moment they are 50 miles apart, let t represent the time that Arnie has been riding since noon. Because Barbara started at 1 pm, she has been riding for one hour less than Arnie. So, let t − 1 represent the numbers of hours that Barbara has been riding at the moment they are 50 miles apart. 578 CHAPTER 8. QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS Now, if Arnie has been riding at a constant rate of 12 miles per hour for t hours, then he has traveled a distance of 12t miles. Because Barbara has been riding at a constant rate of 8 miles per hour for t− 1 hours, she has traveled a distance of 8(t− 1) miles. 8(t− 1) 5012t Figure 8.17: 50 miles apart. The distance and direction traveled by Arnie and Barbara are marked in Figure 8.17. Note that we have a right triangle, so the sides of the triangle must satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem. That is, (12t)2 + [8(t− 1)]2 = 502. Use the Pythagorean Theorem. Distribute the 8. (12t)2 + (8t− 8)2 = 502 Distribute the 8. Square each term. Use (a− b)2 = a2 − 2ab+ b2 to expand (8t− 8)2. 144t2 + 64t2 − 128t+ 64 = 2500 Square each term. 208t2 − 128t+ 64 = 2500 Simplify: 144t2 + 64t2 = 208t2 The resulting equation is nonlinear. Make one side equal to zero. 208t2 − 128t− 2436 = 0 Subtract 2500 from both sides. 52t2 − 32t− 609 = 0 Divide both sides by 4.

Substitute 52 for a, −32 for b, and −609 for c. t = −(−32)±√(−32)2 − 4(52)(−609) 2(52) Substitute: 52 for a, −32 for b, and −609 for c t = 32±√1024 + 126672 104 Exponent, then multiplication. t = 32±√127696 104 Simplify.
