Polynomials Polynomials Let us consider the collection of all algebraic expressions that do not contain variables in the denominators of fractions and where all exponents on the variable quantities are whole numbers. Expressions in this collection are called polynomials. Some expressions that are polynomials are Example 4.38.  3x 4 Example 4.39.  .A fraction occurs, but no variable appears in the denominator. Example 4.40.  5x 3 + 3x 2 − 2x + 1 Some expressions that are not polynomials are Example 4.41.  .A variable appears in the denominator. Example 4.42.  4x 2 − 5x + x − 3 .A negative exponent appears on a variable.
