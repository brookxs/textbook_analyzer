Order and the Inequality Symbols Our number system is called an ordered number system because the numbers in the system can be placed in order from smaller to larger. This is easily seen on the number line. On the number line, a number that appears to the right of another number is larger than that other number. For example, 5 is greater than 2 because 5 is located to the right of 2 on the number line. We may also say that 2 is less than 5. To make the inequality phrases "greater than" and "less than" more brief, mathematicians represent them with the symbols > and <, respectively. Symbols for Greater Than > and Less Than < > represents the phrase "greater than." < represents the phrase "less than." 5 > 2 represents "5 is greater than 2." 2 < 5 represents "2 is less than 5."
