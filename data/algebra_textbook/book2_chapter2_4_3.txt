Opposite-Side Like Terms Given a linear equation in the form a x + b = c x + d , we begin by combining like terms on opposite sides of the equal sign. To combine opposite-side like terms Like terms of an equation on opposite sides of the equal sign. , use the addition or subtraction property of equality to effectively “move terms” from one side to the other so that they can be combined.   Example 2: Solve: − 2 y − 3 = 5 y + 11 . Solution: To “move” the term 5 y to the left side, subtract it on both sides. From here, solve using the techniques developed previously. Always check to see that the solution is correct by substituting the solution back into the original equation and simplifying to see if you obtain a true statement. Answer: The solution is −2.
