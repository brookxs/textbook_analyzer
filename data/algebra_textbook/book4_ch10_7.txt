 || Multiplication of Signed Numbers Let us consider first, the product of two positive numbers. Multiply: 3 ⋅ 5. 3 ⋅ 5 means 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 This suggests[1] that ( positive number ) ⋅ ( positive number ) = ( positive number ) More briefly, ( + ) ( + ) = ( + ) Now consider the product of a positive number and a negative number. Multiply: (3)( − 5). (3)( − 5) means ( − 5) + ( − 5) + ( − 5) = − 15 This suggests that ( positive number ) ⋅ ( negative number ) = ( negative number ) More briefly, ( + ) ( – ) = ( – ) By the commutative property of multiplication, we get ( negative number ) ⋅ ( positive number ) = ( negative number ) More briefly, ( − ) ( + ) = ( − ) The sign of the product of two negative numbers can be suggested after observing the following illustration. Multiply -2 by, respectively, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -4. We have the following rules for multiplying signed numbers. Rules for Multiplying Signed Numbers Multiplying signed numbers: To multiply two real numbers that have the same sign, multiply their absolute values. The product is positive. ( + ) ( + ) = ( + ) ( − ) ( − ) = ( + ) To multiply two real numbers that have opposite signs, multiply their abso­lute values. The product is negative. ( + ) ( − ) = ( − ) ( − ) ( + ) = ( − ) Sample Set A Find the following products. Example 10.35.  8 ⋅ 6 Multiply these absolute values. 8 ⋅ 6 = 48 Since the numbers have the same sign, the product is positive. Thus, 8⋅6=+48, or 8⋅6 = 48. Example 10.36.  ( − 8)( − 6) Multiply these absolute values. 8 ⋅ 6 = 48 Since the numbers have the same sign, the product is positive. Thus, ( − 8)( − 6)=+48, or ( − 8)( − 6) = 48. Example 10.37.  ( − 4)(7) Multiply these absolute values. 4 ⋅ 7 = 28 Since the numbers have opposite signs, the product is negative. Thus, ( − 4)(7) = − 28. Example 10.38.  6( − 3) Multiply these absolute values. 6 ⋅ 3 = 18 Since the numbers have opposite signs, the product is negative. Thus, 6( − 3) = − 18. Practice Set A Find the following products.

That is,   ( + ) = ( − )( − ) suggests that What is ? − 12 = (3)( − 4) suggests that . That is,   ( − ) = ( + )( − ) suggests that What is ? − 12 = ( − 3)(4) suggests that . That is,   ( − ) = ( − )( + ) suggests that We have the following rules for dividing signed numbers. Rules for Dividing Signed Numbers Dividing signed numbers: To divide two real numbers that have the same sign, divide their absolute values. The quotient is positive. To divide two real numbers that have opposite signs, divide their absolute values. The quotient is negative. Sample Set B Find the following quotients. Example 10.39.  Divide these absolute values. Since the numbers have opposite signs, the quotient is negative. Thus . Example 10.40.  Divide these absolute values. Since the numbers have the same signs, the quotient is positive. Thus, . Example 10.41.  Divide these absolute values. Since the numbers have opposite signs, the quotient is negative. Thus, . Practice Set B Find the following quotients. Exercise 10.7.7.
