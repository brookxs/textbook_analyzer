Multiplying by the Reciprocal To solve an equation like 3 4 x = 1 , we can isolate the variable by dividing both sides by the coefficient. For example, On the left side of the equal sign, the fraction cancels. On the right side, we have a complex fraction and multiply by the reciprocal of the coefficient. You can save a step by recognizing this and start by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of the coefficient. Recall that the product of reciprocals is 1, in this case , leaving the variable isolated.   Example 12: Solve: . Solution: Isolate the variable term using the addition property of equality and then multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of the coefficient . Answer: The solution is −6.   Example 13: Solve: . Solution: The reciprocal of is because . Therefore, to isolate the variable x, multiply both sides by . Answer: The solution is −25.   Try this!
