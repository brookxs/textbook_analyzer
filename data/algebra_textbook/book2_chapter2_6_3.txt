Applications When setting up proportions, consistency with the units of each ratio is critical. Units for the numerators should be the same and units for the denominators should also be the same.   Example 7: It is claimed that 2 out of 3 dentists prefer a certain brand of toothpaste. If 600 dentists are surveyed, then how many will say they prefer that brand? Solution: First, identify the unknown and assign it a variable. Since you are looking for the number of dentists who prefer the brand name out of a total of 600 surveyed, construct the ratios with the number of dentists who prefer the brand in the numerator and the total number surveyed in the denominator. Cross multiply and solve for n, Answer: The claim suggests that 400 out of 600 dentists surveyed prefer the brand name.   Example 8: In Tulare County, 3 out of every 7 voters said yes to Proposition 40. If 42,000 people voted, how many said no to Proposition 40? Solution: The problem gives the ratio of voters who said yes, but it asks for the number who said no. If 3 out of 7 said yes, then we can assume 4 out of 7 said no. Set up the ratios with the number of voters who said no in the numerator and the total number of voters in the denominator. Cross multiply and solve for n. Answer: 24,000 voters out of 42,000 said no.   Example 9: The sum of two integers in the ratio of 4 to 5 is 27. Find the integers. Solution: The sum of two integers is 27; use this relationship to avoid two variables. The integers are given to be in the ratio of 4 to 5. Set up the following proportion: Use 27 − n to determine the other integer. Answer: The integers are 12 and 15.   Try this! A recipe calls for 5 tablespoons of sugar for every 8 cups of flour. How many tablespoons of sugar are required for 32 cups of flour? Answer: 20 tablespoons of sugar Video Solution Applications When setting up proportions, consistency with the units of each ratio is critical.
