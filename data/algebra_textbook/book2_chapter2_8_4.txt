Applications of Linear Inequalities Some of the key words and phrases that indicate inequalities are summarized below: Key Phrases Translation A number is at least 5. x ≥ 5 A number is 5 or more inclusive. A number is at most 3. x ≤ 3 A number is 3 or less inclusive. A number is strictly less than 4. x < 4 A number is less than 4, noninclusive. A number is greater than 7. x > 7 A number is more than 7, noninclusive. A number is in between 2 and 10. 2 < x < 10 A number is at least 5 and at most 15. 5 ≤ x ≤ 15 A number may range from 5 to 15. As with all applications, carefully read the problem several times and look for key words and phrases. Identify the unknowns and assign variables. Next, translate the wording into a mathematical inequality. Finally, use the properties you have learned to solve the inequality and express the solution graphically or in interval notation.   Example 9: Translate: Five less than twice a number is at most 25. Solution: First, choose a variable for the unknown number and identify the key words and phrases. Answer: 2 n − 5 ≤ 25 . The key phrase “is at most” indicates that the quantity has a maximum value of 25 or smaller.   Example 10: The temperature in the desert can range from 10°C to 45°C in one 24-hour period. Find the equivalent range in degrees Fahrenheit, F, given that C = 5 9 ( F − 32 ) . Solution: Set up a compound inequality where the temperature in Celsius is inclusively between 10°C and 45°C. Then substitute the expression equivalent to the Celsius temperature in the inequality and solve for F. Answer: The equivalent Fahrenheit range is from 50°F to 113°F.   Example 11: In the first four events of a meet, a gymnast scores 7.5, 8.2, 8.5, and 9.0. What must she score on the fifth event to average at least 8.5? Solution: The average must be at least 8.5; this means that the average must be greater than or equal to 8.5. Answer: She must score at least 9.3 on the fifth event.
