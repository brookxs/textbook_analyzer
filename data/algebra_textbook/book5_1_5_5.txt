Order of Operations Now that we know how to combine like terms, let’s tackle some more compli- cated expressions that require the Rules Guiding Order of Operations. Rules Guiding Order of Operations. When evaluating expressions, pro- ceed in the following order. 1. Evaluate expressions contained in grouping symbols first. If grouping symbols are nested, evaluate the expression in the innermost pair of grouping symbols first. 1.5. ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 67 2. Evaluate all exponents that appear in the expression. 3. Perform all multiplications and divisions in the order that they appear in the expression, moving left to right. 4. Perform all additions and subtractions in the order that they appear in the expression, moving left to right. You Try It! EXAMPLE 14. Simplify: 4(−3a+ 2b)− 3(4a− 5b) Simplify: −2x− 3(5− 2x)Solution: Use the distributive property to distribute the 4 and the −3, then combine like terms. 4(−3a+ 2b)− 3(4a− 5b) = −12a+ 8b− 12a+ 15b Distribute. = −24a+ 23b Combine like terms. Note that −12a− 12a = −24a and 8b+ 15b = 23b. Answer: 4x− 15 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 15. Simplify: −2(3x− 4y)− (5x− 2y) Simplify: −3(u+ v)− (u− 5v)Solution: Use the distributive property to multiply −2 times 3x − 4y, then distribute the minus sign times each term of the expression 5x−2y. After that, combine like terms. −2(3x− 4y)− (5x− 2y) = −6x+ 8y − 5x+ 2y Distribute. = −11x+ 10y Combine like terms: Note that −6x− 5x = −11x and 8y + 2y = 10y. Answer: −4u+ 2v ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 16. Simplify: −2(x2y − 3xy2)− 4(−x2y + 3xy2) Simplify: 8u2v − 3(u2v + 4uv2)Solution: Use the distributive property to multiply −2 times x2y− 3xy2 and−4 times −x2y + 3xy2. After that, combine like terms. −2(x2y − 3xy2)− 4(−x2y + 3xy2) = −2x2y + 6xy2 + 4x2y − 12xy2 = 2x2y − 6xy2 Note that −2x2y + 4x2y = 2x2y and 6xy2 − 12xy2 = −6xy2. Answer: 5u2v − 12uv2 ! 68 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS When grouping symbols are nested, evaluate the expression inside the in- nermost pair of grouping symbols first. You Try It! EXAMPLE 17. Simplify: −2x− 2 (−2x− 2 [−2x− 2])Simplify: x− 2[−x+ 4(x+ 1)] Solution: Inside the parentheses, we have the expression −2x − 2[−2x − 2]. The Rules Guiding Order of Operations dictate that we should multiply first, expanding −2[−2x− 2] and combining like terms. −2x− 2 (−2x− 2 [−2x− 2]) = −2x− 2 (−2x+ 4x+ 2) = −2x− 2 (2x+ 2) In the remaining expression, we again multiply first, expanding −2(2x+2) and combining like terms. = −2x− 4x− 4 = −6x− 4 Answer: −5x− 8 ! 1.5.
