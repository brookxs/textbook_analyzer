The Subtraction Process We'll study the process of the subtraction of two whole numbers by considering the difference between 48 and 35. which we write as 13. Example 1.33. The Process of Subtracting Whole Numbers To subtract two whole numbers, The process Write the numbers vertically, placing corresponding positions in the same column. Subtract the digits in each column. Start at the right, in the ones position, and move to the left, placing the difference at the bottom. Sample Set B Perform the following subtractions. Example 1.34.  Example 1.35.  Example 1.36.  Find the difference between 977 and 235. Write the numbers vertically, placing the larger number on top. Line up the columns properly. The difference between 977 and 235 is 742. Example 1.37.  In Keys County in 1987, there were 809 cable television installations. In Flags County in 1987, there were 1,159 cable television installations. How many more cable television installations were there in Flags County than in Keys County in 1987? We need to determine the difference between 1,159 and 809. There were 350 more cable television installations in Flags County than in Keys County in 1987. Practice Set B Perform the following subtractions. Exercise 1.6.4. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.5. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.6. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.8. (Go to Solution) Find the difference between 88,526 and 26,412. In each of these problems, each bottom digit is less than the corresponding top digit. This may not always be the case. We will examine the case where the bottom digit is greater than the corresponding top digit in the next section.
