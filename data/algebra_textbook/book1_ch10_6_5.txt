The Quadratic Formula When a quadratic equation is written in standard form so that the values a, b, and c are readily determined, the equation can be solved using the quadratic formula. The values that satisfy the equation are found by substituting the values a, b, and c into the formula Quadratic Formula Keep in mind that the plus or minus symbol, ± , is just a shorthand way of denoting the two possibilities:The quadratic formula can be derived by using the method of completing the square.
