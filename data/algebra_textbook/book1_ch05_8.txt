 || Solutions to Linear Equations in Two Variables Solution to an Equation in Two Variables We have discovered that an equation is a mathematical way of expressing the relationship of equality between quantities. If the relationship is between two quantities, the equation will contain two variables. We say that an equation in two variables has a solution if an ordered pair of values can be found such that when these two values are substituted into the equation a true statement results. This is illustrated when we observe some solutions to the equation y = 2x + 5 . x = 4, y = 13;          since 13 = 2(4) + 5 is true . x = 1, y = 7;          since 7 = 2(1) + 5 is true . x = 0, y = 5;          since 5 = 2(0) + 5 is true . x = − 6, y = − 7;          since -7 = 2( − 6) + 5 is true .  || Ordered Pairs as Solutions It is important to keep in mind that a solution to a linear equation in two variables is an ordered pair of values, one value for each variable. A solution is not completely known until the values of both variables are specified. Independent and Dependent Variables Recall that, in an equation, any variable whose value can be freely assigned is said to be an independent variable. Any variable whose value is determined once the other value or values have been assigned is said to be a dependent variable. If, in a linear equation, the independent variable is x and the dependent variable is y , and a solution to the equation is x = a and y = b , the solution is written as the ORDERED PAIR      (a, b) Ordered Pair In an ordered pair, (a, b) , the first component, a , gives the value of the independent variable, and the second component, b , gives the value of the dependent variable. We can use ordered pairs to show some solutions to the equation y = 6x − 7 . Example 5.60.  (0, − 7) .If x = 0 and y = − 7 , we get a true statement upon substitution and computataion. Example 5.61.  (8, 41) .If x = 8 and y = 41 , we get a true statement upon substitution and computataion. Example 5.62.  ( − 4,  − 31) .If x = − 4 and y = − 31 , we get a true statement upon substitution and computataion. These are only three of the infintely many solutions to this equation.  || Calculator Problems Exercise 5.8.44.
