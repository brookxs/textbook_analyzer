Trinomials When a quadratic has all three terms, you can still solve it with the zero-product rule if you are able to factor the trinomial. ·                     Remember, not all trinomial quadratics can be factored with integer constants If it can be factored, then it can be written as a product of two binomials. The zero-product rule can then be used to set each of these factors equal to zero, resulting in two equations that are both simple linear equations that can be solved for x. See the above example for the zero-product rule to see how this works. A more thorough discussion of factoring trinomials may be found in the chapter on polynomials, but here is a quick review: Trinomials When a quadratic has all three terms, you can still solve it with the zero-product rule if you are able to factor the trinomial. ·                     Remember, not all trinomial quadratics can be factored with integer constants If it can be factored, then it can be written as a product of two binomials.
