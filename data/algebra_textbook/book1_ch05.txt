 ||  || Types of Equations Identity Some equations are always true. These equations are called identities. Identities are equations that are true for all acceptable values of the variable, that is, for all values in the domain of the equation. 5x = 5x is true for all acceptable values of x . y + 1 = y + 1 is true for all acceptable values of y .2 + 5 = 7 is true, and no substitutions are necessary. Contradiction Some equations are never true. These equations are called contradictions. Contradictions are equations that are never true regardless of the value substituted for the variable. x = x + 1 is never true for any acceptable value of x . 0  ·  k = 14 is never true for any acceptable value of k . 2 = 1 is never true. Conditional Equation The truth of some equations is conditional upon the value chosen for the variable. Such equations are called conditional equations. Conditional equations are equations that are true for at least one replacement of the variable and false for at least one replacement of the variable. x + 6 = 11 is true only on the condition that x = 5. y − 7 = − 1 is true only on the condition that y = 6 .  || Solutions and Equivalent Equations Solutions and Solving an Equation The collection of values that make an equation true are called solutions of the equation. An equation is solved when all its solutions have been found. Equivalent Equations Some equations have precisely the same collection of solutions. Such equations are called equivalent equations. The equations are equivalent equations because the only value that makes each one true is 3.  || Literal Equations Literal Equations Some equations involve more than one variable. Such equations are called literal equations. An equation is solved for a particular variable if that variable alone equals an expression that does not contain that particular variable. The following equations are examples of literal equations. y = 2x + 7 . It is solved for y . d = r t . It is solved for d . I = p r t . It is solved for I . . It is solved for z . y + 1 = x + 4 . This equation is not solved for any particular variable since no variable is isolated.  || Solving Equation of the form x + a = b and x − a = b Recall that the equal sign of an equation indicates that the number represented by the expression on the left side is the same as the number represented by the expression on the right side. This suggests the following procedures: We can obtain an equivalent equation (an equation having the same solutions as the original equation) by adding the same number to both sides of the equation. We can obtain an equivalent equation by subtracting the same number from both sides of the equation. We can use these results to isolate x , thus solving for x . Example 5.4. Solving x + a = b for x Example 5.5. Solving x − a = b for x Example 5.6. Method for Solving x + a = b and x − a = b for x To solve the equation x + a = b for x , subtract a from both sides of the equation. To solve the equation x − a = b for x , add a to both sides of the equation.  ||  || Equality Property of Division and Multiplication Recalling that the equal sign of an equation indicates that the number represented by the expression on the left side is the same as the number represented by the expression on the right side suggests the equality property of division and multiplication, which states: We can obtain an equivalent equation by dividing both sides of the equation by the same nonzero number, that is, if c  ≠  0,  then a  =  b is equivalent to . We can obtain an equivalent equation by multiplying both sides of the equation by the same nonzero number, that is, if c  ≠  0, then a  =  b is equivalent to a c = b c . We can use these results to isolate x, thus solving the equation for x . Example 5.12.  Solving a x = b for x Example 5.13.  Solving for x  || Solving a x = b and for x Example 5.14.  Method for Solving To solve a x = b for x , divide both sides of the equation by a . To solve for x , multiply both sides of the equation by a .  ||  || Combining Techniques in Equation Solving In Sections Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 we worked with techniques that involved the use of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to solve equations. We can combine these techniques to solve more complicated equations. To do so, it is helpful to recall that an equation is solved for a particular variable when all other numbers and/or letters have been disassociated from it and it is alone on one side of the equal sign. We will also note that To associate numbers and letters we use the order of operations. Multiply/divide Add/subtract To undo an association between numbers and letters we use the order of operations in reverse. Add/subtract Multiply/divide  || Recognizing Identities and Contradictions As we noted in Section Section 5.2, some equations are identities and some are contradictions. As the problems of Sample Set D will suggest, Recognizing an Identity If, when solving an equation, all the variables are eliminated and a true statement results, the equation is an identity. Recognizing a Contradiction If, when solving an equation, all the variables are eliminated and a false statement results, the equation is a contradiction.  ||  || Translating from Verbal to Mathematical Expressions To solve a problem using algebra, we must first express the problem algebraically. To express a problem algebraically, we must scrutinize the wording of the problem to determine the variables and constants that are present and the relationships among them. Then we must translate the verbal phrases and statements to algebraic expressions and equations. To help us translate verbal expressions to mathematics, we can use the following table as a mathematics dictionary. Table 5.1. Mathematics Dictionary Word or Phrase Mathematical Operation Sum, sum of, added to, increased by, more than, plus, and + Difference, minus, subtracted from, decreased by, less, less than − Product, the product of, of, muitiplied by, times ⋅ Quotient, divided by, ratio ÷ Equals, is equal to, is, the result is, becomes = A number, an unknown quantity, an unknown, a quantity x (or any symbol)  ||  || Solving Applied Problems Let’s study some interesting problems that involve linear equations in one variable. In order to solve such problems, we apply the following five-step method: Five-Step Method for Solving Word Problems Let x (or some other letter) represent the unknown quantity. Translate the words to mathematical symbols and form an equation. Solve this equation. Ask yourself "Does this result seem reasonable?" Check the solution by substituting the result into the original statement of the problem. If the answer doesn’t check, you have either solved the equation incorrectly, or you have developed the wrong equation. Check your method of solution first. If the result does not check, reconsider your equation. Write the conclusion. If it has been your experience that word problems are difficult, then follow the five-step method carefully. Most people have difficulty because they neglect step 1. Always start by INTRODUCING A VARIABLE! Keep in mind what the variable is representing throughout the problem.  ||  || Inequalities Relationships of Inequality We have discovered that an equation is a mathematical way of expressing the relationship of equality between quantities. Not all relationships need be relationships of equality, however. Certainly the number of human beings on earth is greater than 20. Also, the average American consumes less than 10 grams of vitamin C every day. These types of relationships are not relationships of equality, but rather, relationships of inequality.  || Linear Inequalities Linear Inequality A linear inequality is a mathematical statement that one linear expression is greater than or less than another linear expression. Inequality Notation The following notation is used to express relationships of inequality: Note that the expression x > 12 has infinitely many solutions. Any number strictly greater than 12 will satisfy the statement. Some solutions are 13, 15, 90, 12.1, 16.3 and 102.51 .  || The Algebra of Linear Inequalities Inequalities can be solved by basically the same methods as linear equations. There is one important exception that we will discuss in item 3 of the algebra of linear inequalities.  || Compound Inequalities Compound Inequality Another type of inequality is the compound inequality. A compound inequality is of the form: a < x < b There are actually two statements here. The first statement is a < x . The next statement is x < b . When we read this statement we say " a is less than x ," then continue saying "and x is less than b ." Just by looking at the inequality we can see that the number x is between the numbers a and b . The compound inequality a < x < b indicates "betweenness." Without changing the meaning, the statement a < x can be read x > a . (Surely, if the number a is less than the number x , the number x must be greater than the number a .) Thus, we can read a < x < b as " x is greater than a and at the same time is less than b ." For example: 4 < x < 9 .The letter x is some number strictly between 4 and 9. Hence, x is greater than 4 and, at the same time, less than 9. The numbers 4 and 9 are not included so we use open circles at these points. − 2 < z < 0 .The z stands for some number between − 2 and 0. Hence, z is greater than − 2 but also less than 0. 1 < x + 6 < 8 .The expression x + 6 represents some number strictly between 1 and 8. Hence, x + 6 represents some number strictly greater than 1, but less than 8. .The term represents some number between and including and . Hence, represents some number greater than or equal to to but less than or equal to . Consider problem 3 above, 1 < x + 6 < 8 . The statement says that the quantity x + 6 is between 1 and 8. This statement will be true for only certain values of x . For example, if x = 1 , the statement is true since 1 < 1 + 6 < 8 . However, if x = 4.9 , the statement is false since 1 < 4.9 + 6 < 8 is clearly not true. The first of the inequalities is satisfied since 1 is less than 10.9 , but the second inequality is not satisfied since 10.9 is not less than 8. We would like to know for exactly which values of x the statement 1 < x + 6 < 8 is true. We proceed by using the properties discussed earlier in this section, but now we must apply the rules to all three parts rather than just the two parts in a regular inequality.  ||  || Solutions to Linear Equations in Two Variables Solution to an Equation in Two Variables We have discovered that an equation is a mathematical way of expressing the relationship of equality between quantities. If the relationship is between two quantities, the equation will contain two variables. We say that an equation in two variables has a solution if an ordered pair of values can be found such that when these two values are substituted into the equation a true statement results. This is illustrated when we observe some solutions to the equation y = 2x + 5 . x = 4, y = 13;          since 13 = 2(4) + 5 is true . x = 1, y = 7;          since 7 = 2(1) + 5 is true . x = 0, y = 5;          since 5 = 2(0) + 5 is true . x = − 6, y = − 7;          since -7 = 2( − 6) + 5 is true .  || Ordered Pairs as Solutions It is important to keep in mind that a solution to a linear equation in two variables is an ordered pair of values, one value for each variable. A solution is not completely known until the values of both variables are specified. Independent and Dependent Variables Recall that, in an equation, any variable whose value can be freely assigned is said to be an independent variable. Any variable whose value is determined once the other value or values have been assigned is said to be a dependent variable. If, in a linear equation, the independent variable is x and the dependent variable is y , and a solution to the equation is x = a and y = b , the solution is written as the ORDERED PAIR      (a, b) Ordered Pair In an ordered pair, (a, b) , the first component, a , gives the value of the independent variable, and the second component, b , gives the value of the dependent variable. We can use ordered pairs to show some solutions to the equation y = 6x − 7 . Example 5.60.  (0, − 7) .If x = 0 and y = − 7 , we get a true statement upon substitution and computataion. Example 5.61.  (8, 41) .If x = 8 and y = 41 , we get a true statement upon substitution and computataion. Example 5.62.  ( − 4,  − 31) .If x = − 4 and y = − 31 , we get a true statement upon substitution and computataion. These are only three of the infintely many solutions to this equation.  || Calculator Problems Exercise 5.8.44.
