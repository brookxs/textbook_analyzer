Speeding Things Up a Bit Eventually, after showing your work on a number of examples such as those in Examples 7, 8, and 9, you’ll need to learn how to perform the process mentally. You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Factor each of the following polynomials: (a) 24x+ 32,Factor: 18p5q4 − 30p4q5 + 42p3q6 (b) 5x3 − 10x2 − 10x, and (c) 2x4y + 2x3y2 − 6x2y3. Solution: In each case, factor out the greatest common factor (GCF): a) The GCF of 24x and 32 is 8. Thus, 24x+ 32 = 8(3x+ 4) b) The GCF of 5x3, 10x2, and 10x is 5x. Thus: 5x3 − 10x2 − 10x = 5x(x2 − 2x− 2) c) The GCF of 2x4y, 2x3y2, and 6x2y3 is 2x2y. Thus: 2x4y + 2x3y2 − 6x2y3 = 2x2y(x2 + xy − 3y2) As you speed things up by mentally factoring out the GCF, it is even more important that you check your results. The check can also be done mentally. For example, in checking the third result, mentally distribute 2x2y times each term of x2 +xy− 3y2. Multiplying 2x2y times the first term x2 produces 2x4y, the first term in the original polynomial. 2x2y (x2 + xy − 3y2) = 2x4y + 2x3y2 − 6x2y3 Continue in this manner, mentally checking the product of 2x2y with each term of x2 + xy − 3y2, making sure that each result agrees with the corresponding term of the original polynomial.Answer: 6p3q4(3p2 − 5pq + 7q2) ! Remember that the distributive property allows us to pull the GCF out in front of the expression or to pull it out in back. In symbols: ab+ ac = a(b + c) or ba+ ca = (b+ c)a 6.1.

Factor: 2x(3x+ 2) + 5(3x+ 2) Factor: 3x2(4x− 7) + 8(4x− 7) Solution: In this case, the greatest common factor (GCF) is 3x+ 2. 2x(3x+ 2) + 5(3x+ 2) = 2x · (3x+ 2) + 5 · (3x+ 2) = (2x+ 5)(3x+ 2) Because of the commutative property of multiplication, it is equally valid to pull the GCF out in front. 2x(3x+ 2) + 5(3x+ 2) = (3x+ 2) · 2x+ (3x+ 2) · 5 = (3x+ 2)(2x+ 5) Note that the order of factors differs from the first solution, but because of the commutative property of multiplication, the order does not matter. The answers are the same. Answer: (3x2 + 8)(4x− 7) ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 12. Factor: 15a(a+ b)− 12(a+ b) Factor: 24m(m− 2n) + 20(m− 2n) Solution: In this case, the greatest common factor (GCF) is 3(a+ b). 15a(a+ b)− 12(a+ b) = 3(a+ b) · 5a− 3(a+ b) · 4 = 3(a+ b)(5a− 4) Alternate solution: It is possible that you might fail to notice that 15 and 12 are divisible by 3, factoring out only the common factor a+ b. 15a(a+ b)− 12(a+ b) = 15a · (a+ b)− 12 · (a+ b) = (15a− 12)(a+ b) However, you now need to notice that you can continue, factoring out 3 from both 15a and 12. = 3(5a− 4)(a+ b) Note that the order of factors differs from the first solution, but because of the commutative property of multiplication, the order does not matter.
