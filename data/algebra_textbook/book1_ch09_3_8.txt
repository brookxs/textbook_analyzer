Square Roots Involving Fractions A square root expression is in simplified form if there are no perfect squares in the radicand, no fractions in the radicand, or 3. no square root expressions in the denominator. The square root expressions and are in simplified form. The square root expressions and are not in simplified form. SIMPLIFYING SQUARE ROOTS WITH FRACTIONS To simplify the square root expression Write the expression as using the rule Multiply the fraction by 1 in the form of Simplify the remaining fraction, Rationalizing the Denominator The process involved in step 2 is called rationalizing the denominator. This process removes square root expressions from the denominator using the fact that Square Roots Involving Fractions A square root expression is in simplified form if there are no perfect squares in the radicand, no fractions in the radicand, or 3. no square root expressions in the denominator.
