Addition Involving Carrying It often happens in addition that the sum of the digits in a column will exceed 9. This happens when we add 18 and 34. We show this in expanded form as follows. Notice that when we add the 8 ones to the 4 ones we get 12 ones. We then convert the 12 ones to 1 ten and 2 ones. In vertical addition, we show this conversion by carrying the ten to the tens column. We write a 1 at the top of the tens column to indicate the carry. This same example is shown in a shorter form as follows: 8 + 4 = 12 Write 2, carry 1 ten to the top of the next column to the left. Sample Set B Perform the following additions. Use the process of carrying when needed. Example 1.23.  Add 1875 and 358. The sum is 2233. Example 1.24.  Add 89,208 and 4,946. The sum is 94,154. Example 1.25.  Add 38 and 95. As you proceed with the addition, it is a good idea to keep in mind what is actually happening. The sum is 133. Example 1.26.  Find the sum 2648, 1359, and 861. The sum is 4,868. Numbers other than 1 can be carried as illustrated in Example 1.27. Example 1.27.  Find the sum of the following numbers. The sum is 983,689. Example 1.28.  The number of students enrolled at Riemann College in the years 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987 was 10,406, 9,289, 10,108, and 11,412, respectively. What was the total number of students en­rolled at Riemann College in the years 1985, 1986, and 1987? We can determine the total number of students enrolled by adding 9,289, 10,108, and 11,412, the number of students enrolled in the years 1985, 1986, and 1987. The total number of students enrolled at Riemann College in the years 1985, 1986, and 1987 was 30,809. Practice Set B Perform each addition. For the next three problems, show the expanded form. Exercise 1.5.4. (Go to Solution) Add 58 and 29. Exercise 1.5.5. (Go to Solution) Add 476 and 85. Exercise 1.5.6. (Go to Solution) Add 27 and 88. Exercise 1.5.7.
