Completing the Square In this section we start with the binomial x2 + bx and ask the question “What constant value should we add to x2 + bx so that the resulting trinomial is a perfect square trinomial?” The answer lies in this procedure. Completing the square. To calculate the constant required to make x2 + bx a perfect square trinomial: 1. Take one-half of the coefficient of x: b 2 2. Square the result of step one: ( b 2 )2 = b2 4 3. Add the result of step two to x2 + bx: x2 + bx+ b2 4 If you follow this process, the result will be a perfect square trinomial which will factor as follows: x2 + bx+ b2 4 = ( x+ b 2 )2 You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Given x2 + 12x, complete the square to create a perfectGiven x2 + 16x, complete the square to create a perfect square trinomial. square trinomial. Solution: Compare x2 + 12x with x2 + bx and note that b = 12. 1. Take one-half of 12: 6 2. Square the result of step one: 62 = 36 3. Add the result of step two to x2 + 12x: x2 + 12x+ 36 8.3. COMPLETING THE SQUARE 563 Check: Note that the first and last terms of x2 +12x+36 are perfect squares. Take the square roots of the first and last terms and factor as follows: x2 + 12x+ 36 = (x + 6)2 Note that 2(x)(6) = 12x, so the middle term checks. Answer: x2 + 16x+ 64 = (x+ 8)2 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Given x2−3x, complete the square to create a perfect square Given x2 − 5x, complete the square to create a perfect square trinomial. trinomial. Solution: Compare x2 − 3x with x2 + bx and note that b = −3. 1. Take one-half of −3: −3 2 2. Square the result of step one: ( −3 2 )2 = 9 4 3. Add the result of step two to x2 − 3x: x2 − 3x+ 9 4 Check: Note that the first and last terms of x2− 3x+9/4 are perfect squares. Take the square roots of the first and last terms and factor as follows: x2 − 3x+ 9 4 = ( x− 3 2 )2 Note that 2(x) (3/2) = 3x, so the middle term checks. Answer: x2 − 5x+ 10/4 = (x− 5/2)2 !
