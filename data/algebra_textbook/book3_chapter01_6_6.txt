Adding and Subtracting Fractions ·            Add Numerators when Denominators Are the Same ·        If the denominators are not the same, make them the same by building up the fractions so that they both have a common denominator. ·        Any common denominator will work, but the answer will have to be reduced if it is not the Least Common Denominator. ·        The product of all the denominators is always a common denominator (but not necessarily the Least Common Denominator).
