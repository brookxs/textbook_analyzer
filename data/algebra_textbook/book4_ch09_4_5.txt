Adding and Subtracting Denominate Numbers Adding and Subtracting Denominate Numbers Denominate numbers can be added or subtracted by: writing the numbers vertically so that the like units appear in the same column. adding or subtracting the number parts, carrying along the unit. simplifying the sum or difference. Sample Set B Example 9.12.  Add 6 ft 8 in. to 2 ft 9 in. Since 12 in. = 1 ft, Example 9.13.  Subtract 5 da 3 hr from 8 da 11 hr. Example 9.14.  Subtract 3 lb 14 oz from 5 lb 3 oz. We cannot directly subtract 14 oz from 3 oz, so we must borrow 16 oz from the pounds. Example 9.15.  Subtract 4 da 9 hr 21 min from 7 da 10 min. Borrow 1 da from the 7 da. Borrow 1 hr from the 24 hr. Practice Set B Perform each operation. Simplify when possible. Exercise 9.4.6. (Go to Solution) Add 4 gal 3 qt to 1 gal 2 qt. Exercise 9.4.7. (Go to Solution) Add 9 hr 48 min to 4 hr 26 min. Exercise 9.4.8. (Go to Solution) Subtract 2 ft 5 in. from 8 ft 7 in. Exercise 9.4.9. (Go to Solution) Subtract 15 km 460 m from 27 km 800 m. Exercise 9.4.10. (Go to Solution) Subtract 8 min 35 sec from 12 min 10 sec. Exercise 9.4.11. (Go to Solution) Add 4 yd 2 ft 7 in. to 9 yd 2 ft 8 in. Exercise 9.4.12. (Go to Solution) Subtract 11 min 55 sec from 25 min 8 sec.
