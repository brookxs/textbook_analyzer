Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem Each side of the square in Figure 8.9 has been divided into two segments, one of length a, the other of length b. a b a b ab a b c c c c Figure 8.9: Proving the Pythagorean Theorem. We can find the total area of the square by squaring any one of the sides of the square. A = (a+ b)2 Square a side to find area. A = a2 + 2ab+ b2 Squaring a binomial pattern. Thus, the total area of the square is A = a2 + 2ab+ b2. A second approach to finding the area of the square is to sum the areas of the geometric parts that make up the square. We have four congruent right triangles, shaded in light red, with base a and height b. The area of each of these triangles is found by taking one-half times the base times the height; i.e., the area of each triangles is (1/2)ab. In the interior, we have a smaller square with side c. Its area is found by squaring its side; i.e., the area of the smaller square is c2. The total area of the square is the sum of its parts, one smaller square and four congruent triangles. That is: A = c2 + 4 ( 1 2 ab ) Adding the area of the interior square and the area of four right triangles. A = c2 + 2ab Simplify: 4((1/2)ab) = 2ab. The two expressions, a2 + 2ab+ b2 and c2 + 2ab, both represent the total area of the large square. Hence, they must be equal to one another. a2 + 2ab+ b2 = c2 + 2ab Each side of this equation represents the area of the large square. a2 + b2 = c2 Subtract 2ab from both sides. 8.2. SIMPLIFYING RADICAL EXPRESSIONS 551 The last equation, a2 + b2 = c2, is called the Pythagorean Theorem. The Pythagorean Theorem. If a and b are the legs of a right triangle and c is its hypotenuse, then: a2 + b2 = c2 We say “The sum of the squares of the legs of a right triangle equals the square of its hypotenuse.” Good hint. Note that the hypotenuse sits by itself on one side of the equation a2 + b2 = c2. The legs of the hypotenuse are on the other side. Let’s put the Pythagorean Theorem to work. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Find the length of the missing side of the right triangle shown Find the missing side of the right triangle shown below. 5 12 c below. 4 3 c Solution: First, write out the Pythagorean Theorem, then substitute the given values in the appropriate places. a2 + b2 = c2 Pythagorean Theorem. (4)2 + (3)2 = c2 Substitute: 4 for a, 3 for b. 16 + 9 = c2 Square: (4)2 = 16, (3)2 = 9. 25 = c2 Add: 16 + 9 = 25. The equation c2 = 25 has two real solutions, c = −5 and c = 5. However, in this situation, c represents the length of the hypotenuse and must be a positive number. Hence: c = 5 Nonnegative square root. Thus, the length of the hypotenuse is 5.

Find the lengths of the legs. the lengths of the legs. Solution: In general, an isosceles triangle is a triangle with two equal sides. In this case, an isosceles right triangle has two equal legs. We’ll let x represent the length of each leg. 8 x x Use the Pythagorean Theorem, substituting x for each leg and 8 for the hy- potenuse. a2 + b2 = c2 Pythagorean Theorem. x2 + x2 = 82 Substitute: x for a, x for b, 8 for c. 2x2 = 64 Combine like terms: x+ x = 2x. x2 = 32 Divide both sides by 2. The equation x2 = 32 has two real solutions, x = −√32 and x = √32. How- ever, in this situation, x represents the length of each leg and must be a positive number. Hence: x = √ 32 Nonnegative square root. Remember, your final answer must be in simple radical form. We must factor out a perfect square when possible. x = √ 16 √ 2 Factor out a perfect square. x = 4 √ 2 Simplify: √ 16 = 4. Thus, the length of each leg is 4 √ 2.Answer: Each leg has length 5 √ 2. ! 8.2.
