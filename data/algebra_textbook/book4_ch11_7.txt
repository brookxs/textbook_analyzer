 || The Five Step Method We are now in a position to solve some applied problems using algebraic methods. The problems we shall solve are intended as logic developers. Although they may not seem to reflect real situations, they do serve as a basis for solving more complex, real situation, applied problems. To solve problems algebraically, we will use the five-step method. Strategy for Reading Word Problems When solving mathematical word problems, you may wish to apply the following "reading strategy." Read the problem quickly to get a feel for the situation. Do not pay close attention to details. At the first reading, too much attention to details may be overwhelming and lead to confusion and discouragement. After the first, brief reading, read the problem carefully in phrases. Reading phrases introduces information more slowly and allows us to absorb and put together important information. We can look for the unknown quantity by reading one phrase at a time. Five-Step Method for Solving Word Problems Let (or some other letter) represent the unknown quantity. Translate the words to mathematical symbols and form an equation. Draw a picture if possible. Solve the equation. Check the solution by substituting the result into the original statement, not equation, of the problem. Write a conclusion. If it has been your experience that word problems are difficult, then follow the five-step method carefully. Most people have trouble with word problems for two reasons: They are not able to translate the words to mathematical symbols. (See Section 11.5.) They neglect step 1. After working through the problem phrase by phrase, to become familiar with the situation, INTRODUCE A VARIABLE  || Number Problems Sample Set A Example 11.44.  What number decreased by six is five? Let represent the unknown number. Translate the words to mathematical symbols and construct an equation. Read phrases. Solve this equation. Add 6 to both sides. Check the result. When 11 is decreased by 6, the result is , which is equal to 5. The solution checks. The number is 11. Example 11.45.  When three times a number is increased by four, the result is eight more than five times the number. Let the unknown number. Translate the phrases to mathematical symbols and construct an equation. Check this result. Three times is . Increasing by 4 results in . Now, five times is . Increasing by results in . The results agree, and the solution checks. The number is Example 11.46.  Consecutive integers have the property that if Consecutive odd or even integers have the property that if The sum of three consecutive odd integers is equal to one less than twice the first odd integer. Find the three integers. Translate the words to mathematical symbols and construct an equation. Read phrases. Check this result. The sum of the three integers is One less than twice the first integer is . Since these two results are equal, the solution checks. The three odd integers are -7, -5, -3. Practice Set A Exercise 11.7.1. (Go to Solution) When three times a number is decreased by 5, the result is -23. Find the number. Let Check: The number is __________. Exercise 11.7.2. (Go to Solution) When five times a number is increased by 7, the result is five less than seven times the number. Find the number. Let Check: The number is __________. Exercise 11.7.3. (Go to Solution) Two consecutive numbers add to 35. Find the numbers. Check: The numbers are __________ and __________. Exercise 11.7.4. (Go to Solution) The sum of three consecutive even integers is six more than four times the middle integer. Find the integers. Let smallest integer. __________= next integer. __________= largest integer. Check: The integers are __________, __________, and __________.  || Geometry Problems Sample Set B Example 11.47.  The perimeter (length around) of a rectangle is 20 meters. If the length is 4 meters longer than the width, find the length and width of the rectangle. Let the width of the rectangle. Then, the length of the rectangle. We can draw a picture. The length around the rectangle is Check: The length of the rectangle is 7 meters. The width of the rectangle is 3 meters. Practice Set B Exercise 11.7.5. (Go to Solution) The perimeter of a triangle is 16 inches. The second leg is 2 inches longer than the first leg, and the third leg is 5 inches longer than the first leg. Find the length of each leg. Let length of the first leg. __________= length of the second leg. __________= length of the third leg. We can draw a picture. Check: The lengths of the legs are__________,__________, and__________.  ||
