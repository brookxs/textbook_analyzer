The Multiplicative Identity The Multiplicative Identity is 1 The whole number 1 is called the multiplicative identity, since any whole num­ber multiplied by 1 is not changed. Sample Set C Example 2.37.  Multiply the whole numbers. 12 ⋅ 1 = 12 1 ⋅ 12 = 12 Practice Set C Multiply the whole numbers. Exercise 2.6.5.
