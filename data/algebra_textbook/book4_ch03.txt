 ||  || Exponential Notation Exponential Notation We have noted that multiplication is a description of repeated addition. Exponen­tial notation is a description of repeated multiplication. Suppose we have the repeated multiplication 8 ⋅ 8 ⋅ 8 ⋅ 8 ⋅ 8 Exponent The factor 8 is repeated 5 times. Exponential notation uses a superscript for the number of times the factor is repeated. The superscript is placed on the repeated factor, 8 5 , in this case. The superscript is called an exponent. The Function of an Exponent An exponent records the number of identical factors that are repeated in a multiplication. Sample Set A Write the following multiplication using exponents. Example 3.1.  3⋅3. Since the factor 3 appears 2 times, we record this as 32 Example 3.2.  62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62. Since the factor 62 appears 9 times, we record this as 629 Expand (write without exponents) each number. Example 3.3.  124 . The exponent 4 is recording 4 factors of 12 in a multiplication. Thus, 124 = 12⋅12⋅12⋅12 Example 3.4.  7063 . The exponent 3 is recording 3 factors of 706 in a multiplication. Thus, 7063 = 706⋅706⋅706 Practice Set A Write the following using exponents.

Exponent, Power 5 is called the exponent, or power. 85 is read as "eight to the fifth power," or more simply as "eight to the fifth," or "the fifth power of eight." Squared When a whole number is raised to the second power, it is said to be squared. The number 52 can be read as 5 to the second power, or 5 to the second, or 5 squared. Cubed When a whole number is raised to the third power, it is said to be cubed. The number 53 can be read as 5 to the third power, or 5 to the third, or 5 cubed. When a whole number is raised to the power of 4 or higher, we simply say that that number is raised to that particular power. The number 58 can be read as 5 to the eighth power, or just 5 to the eighth.  || Roots In the English language, the word "root" can mean a source of something. In mathematical terms, the word "root" is used to indicate that one number is the source of another number through repeated multiplication. Square Root We know that 49 = 72 , that is, 49 = 7⋅7. Through repeated multiplication, 7 is the source of 49. Thus, 7 is a root of 49. Since two 7's must be multiplied together to produce 49, the 7 is called the second or square root of 49. Cube Root We know that 8 = 23 , that is, 8 = 2⋅2⋅2. Through repeated multiplication, 2 is the source of 8. Thus, 2 is a root of 8. Since three 2's must be multiplied together to produce 8, 2 is called the third or cube root of 8. We can continue this way to see such roots as fourth roots, fifth roots, sixth roots, and so on.  || Reading Root Notation There is a symbol used to indicate roots of a number. It is called the radical sign The Radical Sign The symbol is called a radical sign and indicates the nth root of a number. We discuss particular roots using the radical sign as follows: Square Root indicates the square root of the number under the radical sign. It is customary to drop the 2 in the radical sign when discussing square roots. The symbol is understood to be the square root radical sign. = 7 since 7⋅7 = 72 = 49 Cube Root indicates the cube root of the number under the radical sign. since 2⋅2⋅2 = 23 = 8 Fourth Root indicates the fourth root of the number under the radical sign. since 3⋅3⋅3⋅3 = 34 = 81 In an expression such as Radical Sign is called the radical sign. Index 5 is called the index. (The index describes the indicated root.) Radicand 32 is called the radicand. Radical is called a radical (or radical expression). Sample Set B Find each root. Example 3.5.  To determine the square root of 25, we ask, "What whole number squared equals 25?" From our experience with multiplication, we know this number to be 5. Thus, Check: 5 ⋅ 5 = 5 2 = 25 Example 3.6.  To determine the fifth root of 32, we ask, "What whole number raised to the fifth power equals 32?" This number is 2. Check: 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 = 2 5 = 32 Practice Set B Find the following roots using only a knowledge of multiplication. Exercise 3.2.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 3.2.8. (Go to Solution) Exercise 3.2.9.

(Go to Solution)  ||  || Grouping Symbols Grouping symbols are used to indicate that a particular collection of numbers and meaningful operations are to be grouped together and considered as one number. The grouping symbols commonly used in mathematics are the following: ( ), [ ], { }, ___ Parentheses: ( ) Brackets: [ ] Braces: { } Bar: ___ In a computation in which more than one operation is involved, grouping symbols indicate which operation to perform first. If possible, we perform operations inside grouping symbols first. Sample Set A If possible, determine the value of each of the following. Example 3.9.  9 + ( 3 ⋅ 8 ) Since 3 and 8 are within parentheses, they are to be combined first. Thus, 9 + ( 3 ⋅ 8 ) = 33 Example 3.10.  ( 10 ÷ 0 ) ⋅ 6 Since 10÷0 is undefined, this operation is meaningless, and we attach no value to it. We write, "undefined." Practice Set A If possible, determine the value of each of the following. Exercise 3.3.1. (Go to Solution) 16 − (3⋅2) Exercise 3.3.2. (Go to Solution) 5 + (7⋅9) Exercise 3.3.3.

Sample Set B Determine the value of each of the following. Example 3.11.  2 + ( 8 ⋅ 3 ) − ( 5 + 6 ) Combine 8 and 3 first, then combine 5 and 6.

For example, suppose we wish to find the value of 3 + 5⋅2. We could do either of two things: Add 3 and 5, then multiply this sum by 2. Multiply 5 and 2, then add 3 to this product. We now have two values for one number. To determine the correct value, we must use the accepted order of operations. Order of Operations Perform all operations inside grouping symbols, beginning with the innermost set, in the order 2, 3, 4 described below, Perform all exponential and root operations. Perform all multiplications and divisions, moving left to right. Perform all additions and subtractions, moving left to right. Sample Set C Determine the value of each of the following.

(Go to Solution) 6,0533  ||  || Factors From observations made in the process of multiplication, we have seen that ( factor ) ⋅ ( factor ) = product Factors, Product The two numbers being multiplied are the factors and the result of the multiplication is the product. Now, using our knowledge of division, we can see that a first number is a factor of a second number if the first number divides into the second number a whole number of times (without a remainder). One Number as a Factor of Another A first number is a factor of a second number if the first number divides into the second number a whole number of times (without a remainder). We show this in the following examples: Example 3.23.  3 is a factor of 27, since 27÷3 = 9, or 3⋅9 = 27. Example 3.24.  7 is a factor of 56, since 56÷7 = 8, or 7⋅8 = 56. Example 3.25.  4 is not a factor of 10, since 10÷4 = 2R2. (There is a remainder.)  || Determining the Factors of a Whole Number We can use the tests for divisibility from Section 2.5 to determine all the factors of a whole number. Sample Set A Example 3.26.  Find all the factors of 24. The next number to try is 6, but we already have that 6 is a factor. Once we come upon a factor that we already have discovered, we can stop. All the whole number factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Practice Set A Find all the factors of each of the following numbers. Exercise 3.4.1. (Go to Solution) 6 Exercise 3.4.2.

(Go to Solution) 19  || Prime and Composite Numbers Notice that the only factors of 7 are 1 and 7 itself, and that the only factors of 3 are 1 and 3 itself. However, the number 8 has the factors 1, 2, 4, and 8, and the number 10 has the factors 1, 2, 5, and 10. Thus, we can see that a whole number can have only two factors (itself and 1) and another whole number can have several factors. We can use this observation to make a useful classification for whole numbers: prime numbers and composite numbers. Prime Number A whole number (greater than one) whose only factors are itself and 1 is called a prime number. The Number 1 is Not a Prime Number The first seven prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17. Notice that the whole number 1 is not considered to be a prime number, and the whole number 2 is the first prime and the only even prime number. Composite Number A whole number composed of factors other than itself and 1 is called a compos­ite number. Composite numbers are not prime numbers. Some composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 15. Sample Set B Determine which whole numbers are prime and which are composite. Example 3.27.  39. Since 3 divides into 39, the number 39 is composite: 39÷3 = 13 Example 3.28.  47. A few division trials will assure us that 47 is only divisible by 1 and 47. Therefore, 47 is prime.

(Go to Solution) 51  || The Fundamental Principle of Arithmetic Prime numbers are very useful in the study of mathematics. We will see how they are used in subsequent sections. We now state the Fundamental Principle of Arithmetic. Fundamental Principle of Arithmetic Except for the order of the factors, every natural number other than 1 can be factored in one and only one way as a product of prime numbers. Prime Factorization When a number is factored so that all its factors are prime numbers. the factori­zation is called the prime factorization of the number. The technique of prime factorization is illustrated in the following three examples. 10 = 5⋅2. Both 2 and 5 are primes. Therefore, 2⋅5 is the prime factorization of 10. 11. The number 11 is a prime number. Prime factorization applies only to composite numbers. Thus, 11 has no prime factorization. 60 = 2⋅30. The number 30 is not prime: 30 = 2⋅15. 60 = 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 15 The number 15 is not prime: 15 = 3⋅5 60 = 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 We'll use exponents. 60 = 2 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 The numbers 2, 3, and 5 are each prime. Therefore, 22⋅3⋅5 is the prime factorization of 60.  || The Prime Factorization of a Natural Number The following method provides a way of finding the prime factorization of a natural number. The Method of Finding the Prime Factorization of a Natural Number Divide the number repeatedly by the smallest prime number that will divide into it a whole number of times (without a remainder). When the prime number used in step 1 no longer divides into the given number without a remainder, repeat the division process with the next largest prime that divides the given number. Continue this process until the quotient is smaller than the divisor. The prime factorization of the given number is the product of all these prime divisors. If the number has no prime divisors, it is a prime number. We may be able to use some of the tests for divisibility we studied in Section 2.5 to help find the primes that divide the given number. Sample Set C Example 3.29.  Find the prime factorization of 60. Since the last digit of 60 is 0, which is even, 60 is divisible by 2. We will repeatedly divide by 2 until we no longer can. We shall divide as follows: The quotient 1 is finally smaller than the divisor 5, and the prime factorization of 60 is the product of these prime divisors. 60 = 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 We use exponents when possible. 60 = 2 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 Example 3.30.  Find the prime factorization of 441. 441 is not divisible by 2 since its last digit is not divisible by 2. 441 is divisible by 3 since 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 and 9 is divisible by 3. The quotient 1 is finally smaller than the divisor 7, and the prime factorization of 441 is the product of these prime divisors. 441 = 3 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 7 ⋅ 7 Use exponents. 441 = 3 2 ⋅ 7 2 Example 3.31.  Find the prime factorization of 31.

We also notice that 3 appears as a factor in both numbers. Three is also a common factor of 30 and 42. Greatest Common Factor (GCF) When considering two or more numbers, it is often useful to know if there is a largest common factor of the numbers, and if so, what that number is. The largest common factor of two or more whole numbers is called the greatest common factor, and is abbreviated by GCF. The greatest common factor of a collection of whole numbers is useful in working with fractions (which we will do in Section 4.1).  || A Method for Determining the Greatest Common Factor A straightforward method for determining the GCF of two or more whole numbers makes use of both the prime factorization of the numbers and exponents. Finding the GCF To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more whole numbers: Write the prime factorization of each number, using exponents on repeated factors. Write each base that is common to each of the numbers. To each base listed in step 2, attach the smallest exponent that appears on it in either of the prime factorizations. The GCF is the product of the numbers found in step 3. Sample Set A Find the GCF of the following numbers. Example 3.32.  12 and 18 The common bases are 2 and 3. The smallest exponents appearing on 2 and 3 in the prime factorizations are, respectively, 1 and 1 ( 21 and 31 ), or 2 and 3. The GCF is the product of these numbers. 2 ⋅ 3 = 6 The GCF of 30 and 42 is 6 because 6 is the largest number that divides both 30 and 42 without a remainder. Example 3.33.  18, 60, and 72 The common bases are 2 and 3. The smallest exponents appearing on 2 and 3 in the prime factorizations are, respectively, 1 and 1: 21 from 18 31 from 60 The GCF is the product of these numbers. GCF is 2⋅3 = 6 Thus, 6 is the largest number that divides 18, 60, and 72 without a remainder. Example 3.34.  700, 1,880, and 6,160 The common bases are 2 and 5 The smallest exponents appearing on 2 and 5 in the prime factorizations are, respectively, 2 and 1. 22 from 700. 51 from either 1,880 or 6,160. The GCF is the product of these numbers. GCF is 22⋅5 = 4⋅5 = 20 Thus, 20 is the largest number that divides 700, 1,880, and 6,160 without a remainder.

If there are, we will need to know what they are. For example, some of the multiples that are common to 2 and 3 are 6, 12, and 18.

Least Common Multiple The least common multiple, LCM, of two or more whole numbers is the smallest whole number that each of the given numbers will divide into without a remainder. The least common multiple will be extremely useful in working with fractions (Section 4.1).  || Finding the Least Common Multiple Finding the LCM To find the LCM of two or more numbers: Write the prime factorization of each number, using exponents on repeated factors. Write each base that appears in each of the prime factorizations. To each base, attach the largest exponent that appears on it in the prime factorizations. The LCM is the product of the numbers found in step 3. There are some major differences between using the processes for obtaining the GCF and the LCM that we must note carefully: The Difference Between the Processes for Obtaining the GCF and the LCM Notice the difference between step 2 for the LCM and step 2 for the GCF. For the GCF, we use only the bases that are common in the prime factorizations, whereas for the LCM, we use each base that appears in the prime factorizations. Notice the difference between step 3 for the LCM and step 3 for the GCF. For the GCF, we attach the smallest exponents to the common bases, whereas for the LCM, we attach the largest exponents to the bases. Sample Set C Find the LCM of the following numbers. Example 3.36.  9 and 12 The bases that appear in the prime factorizations are 2 and 3. The largest exponents appearing on 2 and 3 in the prime factorizations are, respectively, 2 and 2: 22 from 12. 32 from 9. The LCM is the product of these numbers. LCM = 22⋅32 = 4⋅9 = 36 Thus, 36 is the smallest number that both 9 and 12 divide into without remainders. Example 3.37.  90 and 630 The bases that appear in the prime factorizations are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The largest exponents that appear on 2, 3, 5, and 7 are, respectively, 1, 2, 1, and 1: 21 from either 90 or 630. 32 from either 90 or 630. 51 from either 90 or 630. 71 from 630. The LCM is the product of these numbers. LCM = 2⋅32⋅5⋅7 = 2⋅9⋅5⋅7 = 630 Thus, 630 is the smallest number that both 90 and 630 divide into with no remainders. Example 3.38.  33, 110, and 484 The bases that appear in the prime factorizations are 2, 3, 5, and 11. The largest exponents that appear on 2, 3, 5, and 11 are, respectively, 2, 1, 1, and 2: 22 from 484. 31 from 33. 51 from 110 112 from 484. The LCM is the product of these numbers.
