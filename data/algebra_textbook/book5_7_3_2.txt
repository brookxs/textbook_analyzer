Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions First, recall the rules for adding or subtracting fractions that have a “common” denominator. Adding rational expressions. Given a/c and b/c, their sum is defined as: a c + b c = a+ b c That is, add the numerators and place the result over the common denominator. The following examples each share a common denominator. We add the nu- merators, then place the result over the common denominator. 5 7 + 1 7 = 6 7 , 2 x + 3 x = 5 x , and x y + 3y y = x+ 3y y You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify: 3x xy + 2y xy Simplify: 4x x2y + 5y2 x2y Solution: Add the numerators, placing the result over the common denomi- nator. 3x xy + 2y xy = 3x+ 2y xy Answer: 4x+ 5y2 x2y ! 508 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS Subtracting rational expressions. Given a/c and b/c, their difference is defined as: a c − b c = a− b c That is, subtract the numerators and place the result over the common denom- inator. The following examples each share a common denominator. We subtract the numerators, then place the result over the common denominator. 7 9 − 5 9 = 2 9 , 5a b − 3a b = 2a b , and 3x xy − 5y xy = 3x− 5y xy As the next example shows, sometimes you may have to reduce your answer to lowest terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify: 5xy 2z − 3xy 2zSimplify: 8x 3yz2 − 2x 3yz2 Solution: Subtract the numerators, placing the result over the common denominator. 5xy 2z − 3xy 2z = 5xy − 3xy 2z = 2xy 2z To reduce to lowest terms, divide both numerator and denominator by 2. = xy zAnswer: 2x yz2 !
