 || Positive and Negative Numbers Positive and Negative Numbers Each real number other than zero has a sign associated with it. A real number is said to be a positive number if it is to the right of 0 on the number line and negative if it is to the left of 0 on the number line. THE NOTATION OF SIGNED NUMBERS + and – Notation A number is denoted as positive if it is directly preceded by a plus sign or no sign at all. A number is denoted as negative if it is directly preceded by a minus sign.  || Reading Signed Numbers The plus and minus signs now have two meanings: The plus sign can denote the operation of addition or a positive number. The minus sign can denote the operation of subtraction or a negative number. To avoid any confusion between "sign" and "operation," it is preferable to read the sign of a number as "positive" or "negative." When "+" is used as an operation sign, it is read as "plus." When " – " is used as an operation sign, it is read as "minus." Sample Set A Read each expression so as to avoid confusion between "operation" and "sign." Example 10.6.  – 8 should be read as "negative eight" rather than "minus eight." Example 10.7.  4 + ( – 2) should be read as "four plus negative two" rather than "four plus minus two." Example 10.8.  – 6 + ( – 3)should be read as "negative six plus negative three" rather than "minus six plus minus three." Example 10.9.  – 15 – ( – 6)should be read as "negative fifteen minus negative six" rather than "minus fifteen minus minus six." Example 10.10.  – 5 + 7 should be read as "negative five plus seven" rather than "minus five plus seven." Example 10.11.  0 – 2 should be read as "zero minus two."

(Go to Solution) 0 + ( – 11)  || Opposites Opposites On the number line, each real number, other than zero, has an image on the opposite side of 0. For this reason, we say that each real number has an opposite. Opposites are the same distance from zero but have opposite signs. The opposite of a real number is denoted by placing a negative sign directly in front of the number. Thus, if a is any real number, then − a is its opposite. Note The letter " a " is a variable. Thus, " a " need not be positive, and " – a " need not be negative. If a is any real number, − a is opposite a on the number line.  || The Double-Negative Property The number a is opposite − a on the number line. Therefore, − ( − a) is opposite − a on the number line. This means that − ( − a ) = a From this property of opposites, we can suggest the double-negative property for real numbers. Double-Negative Property: − ( − a) = a If a is a real number, then − ( − a ) = a Sample Set B Find the opposite of each number. Example 10.12.  If a = 2, then – a = – 2. Also, − ( − a) = − ( − 2) = 2. Example 10.13.  If a = – 4, then – a = – ( – 4) = 4. Also, – ( – a) = a = – 4. Practice Set B Find the opposite of each number. Exercise 10.3.7.
