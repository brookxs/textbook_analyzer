 || Reciprocals Reciprocals Two real numbers are said to be reciprocals of each other if their product is 1. Every nonzero real number has exactly one reciprocal, as shown in the examples below. Zero has no reciprocal. Example 3.38.  Example 3.39.  Example 3.40.  Example 3.41.  Example 3.42.  Example 3.43.   || Negative Exponents We can use the idea of reciprocals to find a meaning for negative exponents. Consider the product of x 3 and x − 3 . Assume x ≠ 0 . x 3 ⋅x − 3 = x 3 + ( − 3) = x 0 = 1 Thus, since the product of x 3 and x − 3 is 1, x 3 and x − 3 must be reciprocals. We also know that . (See problem 6 above.) Thus, x 3 and are also reciprocals. Then, since x − 3 and are both reciprocals of x 3 and a real number can have only one reciprocal, it must be that . We have used − 3 as the exponent, but the process works as well for all other negative integers. We make the following definition. If n is any natural number and x is any nonzero real number, then  || Working with Negative Exponents The problems of Sample Set A suggest the following rule for working with exponents: Moving Factors Up and Down In a fraction, a factor can be moved from the numerator to the denominator or from the denominator to the numerator by changing the sign of the exponent.  ||
