Literal Equations Literal equations, or formulas, are often rational equations. Hence the techniques described in this section can be used to solve for particular variables. Assume that all variable expressions in the denominator are nonzero.   Example 6: Solve for x:    z = x − 5 y . Solution: The goal is to isolate x. Assuming that y is nonzero, multiply both sides by y and then add 5 to both sides. Answer: x = y z + 5   Example 7: Solve for c:    1 c = 1 a + 1 b . Solution: In this example, the goal is to isolate c. We begin by multiplying both sides by the LCD, a ⋅ b ⋅ c , distributing carefully. On the right side of the equation, factor out c. Next, divide both sides of the equation by the quantity . Answer:   Try this! Solve for y:    . Answer: Video Solution Literal Equations Literal equations, or formulas, are often rational equations.
