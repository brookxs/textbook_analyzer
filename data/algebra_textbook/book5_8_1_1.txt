Using the Graphing Calculator Up to this point, the equation x2 = a has involved perfect squares. For exam- ple, if we start with x2 = 25, then the solutions are x = ±√25. Because 25 is a perfect square, we can simplify further, arriving at x = ±5. However, the right-hand side of x2 = a does not have to be a perfect square. For example, the equation x2 = 7 has two real solutions, x = ±√7. Because 7 is not a perfect square, we cannot simplify further. In the next example, we’ll use the graphing calculator to compare this algebraic solution with a graphical solution and hopefully provide some assurance that −√7 and √7 are perfectly valid solutions of x2 = 7. 540 CHAPTER 8.

Solution: Enter each side of the equation x2 = 7 in the Y= menu (see Figure 8.1), then select 6:ZStandard to produce the image in Figure 8.1. Figure 8.1: Sketch each side of x2 = 7. Use the 5:intersect utility on the CALC menu to find the points of intersec- tion. Press ENTER in response to “First curve,” press ENTER in response to “Second curve,” then use the arrow keys to move the cursor closer to the point of intersection on the left than the one on the right. Press ENTER in response to “Guess.” This will produce the point of intersection shown in image on the left in Figure 8.2. Repeat the procedure to find the point of intersection in the image on the right in Figure 8.2. Figure 8.2: Finding points of intersection. The approximate solutions of x2 = 7 are x ≈ −2.645751 and x ≈ 2.6457513. Reporting the solution on your homework: Duplicate the image in your calculator’s viewing window on your homework page. Use a ruler to draw all lines, but freehand any curves. • Label the horizontal and vertical axes with x and y, respectively (see Figure 8.3). • Place your WINDOW parameters at the end of each axis (see Figure 8.3). • Label each graph with its equation (see Figure 8.3). • Drop dashed vertical lines through each point of intersection. Shade and label the x-values of the points where the dashed vertical line crosses the x-axis. These are the solutions of the equation x2 = 7 (see Figure 8.3). 8.1.

Now we solve the equation algebraically. x2 = 7 x = ±√7 At this point, the question is: “Do these algebraic solutions match the graphical solutions in Figure 8.3?” Let’s use our calculator to compare results. Locate the square root symbol √ on the calculator case above the x2 key in the leftmost column on the calculator keyboard. Note that we will have to use the 2nd key to access this operator. Enter −√ (7) and press ENTER. Then enter √ (7) and press ENTER. The results are shown in Figure 8.4. Figure 8.4: Computing −√7 and √7. Thus, −√7 ≈ −2.645751311 and √7 ≈ 2.645751311.

Because there are no points of intersection, the graph in Figure 8.6 informs us that the equation x2 = −5 has no real solutions. Now we solve the equation algebraically. x2 = −5 However, you cannot square a real number and get a negative answer. Hence, the equation x2 = −5 has no real solutions.
