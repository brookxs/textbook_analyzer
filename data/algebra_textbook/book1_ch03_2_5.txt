Opposites Opposites On the number line, each real number has an image on the opposite side of 0. For this reason we say that each real number has an opposite. Opposites are the same distance from zero but have opposite signs. The opposite of a real number is denoted by placing a negative sign directly in front of the number. Thus, if a is any real number, then − a is its opposite. Notice that the letter a is a variable. Thus, " a " need not be positive, and " − a " need not be negative. If a is a real number, − a is opposite a on the number line and a is opposite − a on the number line. − ( − a ) is opposite − a on the number line. This implies that − ( − a ) = a . This property of opposites suggests the double-negative property for real numbers. THE DOUBLE-NEGATIVE PROPERTY If a is a real number, then − ( − a ) = a Opposites Opposites On the number line, each real number has an image on the opposite side of 0.
