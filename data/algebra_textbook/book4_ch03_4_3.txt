Determining the Factors of a Whole Number We can use the tests for divisibility from Section 2.5 to determine all the factors of a whole number. Sample Set A Example 3.26.  Find all the factors of 24. The next number to try is 6, but we already have that 6 is a factor. Once we come upon a factor that we already have discovered, we can stop. All the whole number factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Practice Set A Find all the factors of each of the following numbers. Exercise 3.4.1. (Go to Solution) 6 Exercise 3.4.2. (Go to Solution) 12 Exercise 3.4.3. (Go to Solution) 18 Exercise 3.4.4. (Go to Solution) 5 Exercise 3.4.5. (Go to Solution) 10 Exercise 3.4.6. (Go to Solution) 33 Exercise 3.4.7.
