Subtraction as the Opposite of Addition Subtraction can be thought of as the opposite of addition. We show this in the problems in Sample Set A. Sample Set A Example 1.31.  8 − 5 = 3 since 3 + 5 = 8. Example 1.32.  9 − 3 = 6 since 6 + 3 = 9. Practice Set A Complete the following statements. Exercise 1.6.1. (Go to Solution) 7 − 5 = __________ since __________ + 5 = 7. Exercise 1.6.2. (Go to Solution) 9 − 1 = __________ since __________ + 1 = 9. Exercise 1.6.3. (Go to Solution) 17 − 8 = __________ since __________ + 8 = 17.
