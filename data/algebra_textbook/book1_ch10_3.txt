 || Factoring Method To solve quadratic equations by factoring, we must make use of the zero-factor property. Set the equation equal to zero, that is, get all the nonzero terms on one side of the equal sign and 0 on the other. a x 2 + b x + c = 0 Factor the quadratic expression. ( )( ) = 0 By the zero-factor property, at least one of the factors must be zero, so, set each of the factors equal to 0 and solve for the variable.  || Solving Mentally After Factoring Let’s consider problems 4 and 5 of Sample Set A in more detail. Let’s look particularly at the factorizations ( 2x − 3 )( x + 5 ) = 0 and ( 9x + 2 )( 7x − 3 ) = 0. The next step is to set each factor equal to zero and solve. We can solve mentally if we understand how to solve linear equations: we transpose the constant from the variable term and then divide by the coefficient of the variable.  ||
