Multiplication of Fractions Multiplication of Fractions To multiply two fractions, multiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together. Reduce to lowest terms if possible. Example 1.24.  For example, multiply Notice that we since had to reduce, we nearly started over again with the original two fractions. If we factor first, then cancel, then multiply, we will save time and energy and still obtain the correct product.
