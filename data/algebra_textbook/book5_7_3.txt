Recall that to form the product of two rational numbers, we simply multiply numerators and denominators. The same technique is used to multiply any two rational expressions. Multiplying rational expressions. Given a/b and c/d, their product is defined as: a b · c d = ac bd Remember, you need only multiply numerators and denominators. For exam- ple: x 3 · 2 y = 2x 3y , 2a 3b2 · 5a 9b3 = 10a2 27b5 , and x 2y · ( − 3x 4y2 ) = −3x 2 8y3 Of course, as the next example shows, sometimes you also need to reduce your answer to lowest terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify: 2 x · x 2 4 Simplify: 9 x2 · x 6 506 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS Solution: Multiply numerators and denominators. 2 x · x 2 4 = 2x5 4x3 Now, there several different ways you can reduce this answer to lowest terms, two of which are shown below. You can factor numerator and de- nominator, then cancel common factors. 2x5 4x3 = 2 · x · x · x · x · x 2 · 2 · x · x · x = ! 2 · !x · !x · !x · x · x !2 · 2 · !x · !x · !x = x2 2 Or you can write the answer as a product, repeat the base and sub- tract exponents. 2x5 4x3 = 2 4 · x 5 x3 = 1 2 · x5−3 = 1 2 x2 As dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by 1/2, these answers are equivalent. Also, note that the right-hand method is more efficient.Answer: 3 2x ! Recall that when dividing fractions, we invert the second fraction and mul- tiply. Dividing rational expressions.

Note that the right-hand method is more efficient. Answer: 12 x2y !  || Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions First, recall the rules for adding or subtracting fractions that have a “common” denominator. Adding rational expressions. Given a/c and b/c, their sum is defined as: a c + b c = a+ b c That is, add the numerators and place the result over the common denominator. The following examples each share a common denominator. We add the nu- merators, then place the result over the common denominator. 5 7 + 1 7 = 6 7 , 2 x + 3 x = 5 x , and x y + 3y y = x+ 3y y You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify: 3x xy + 2y xy Simplify: 4x x2y + 5y2 x2y Solution: Add the numerators, placing the result over the common denomi- nator. 3x xy + 2y xy = 3x+ 2y xy Answer: 4x+ 5y2 x2y ! 508 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS Subtracting rational expressions. Given a/c and b/c, their difference is defined as: a c − b c = a− b c That is, subtract the numerators and place the result over the common denom- inator. The following examples each share a common denominator. We subtract the numerators, then place the result over the common denominator. 7 9 − 5 9 = 2 9 , 5a b − 3a b = 2a b , and 3x xy − 5y xy = 3x− 5y xy As the next example shows, sometimes you may have to reduce your answer to lowest terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify: 5xy 2z − 3xy 2zSimplify: 8x 3yz2 − 2x 3yz2 Solution: Subtract the numerators, placing the result over the common denominator. 5xy 2z − 3xy 2z = 5xy − 3xy 2z = 2xy 2z To reduce to lowest terms, divide both numerator and denominator by 2. = xy zAnswer: 2x yz2 !  || The Least Common Denominator When adding or subtracting, if the rational expressions do not share a com- mon denominator, you must first make equivalent fractions with a common denominator. Least common denominator. If the fractions a/b and c/d do not share a common denominator, then the least common denominator for b and d is defined as the smallest number (or expression) divisible by both b and d. In symbols, LCD(b, d) represents the least common denominator of b and d. 7.3. SIMPLIFYING RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS 509 You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify: x 6 + 2x 9 Simplify: 3x 8 + 5x 6 Solution: The smallest number divisible by both 6 and 9 is 18; i.e., LCD(6, 9) = 18. We must first make equivalent fractions with a common denominator of 18. x 6 + 2x 9 = x 6 · 3 3 + 2x 9 · 2 2 = 3x 18 + 4x 18 We can now add the numerators and put the result over the common denomi- nator. = 7x 18 Answer: 29x 24 !

We must first make equivalent fractions with a common denominator of 24x, then place the difference of the numerators over the common denominator. y 8x − y 12x = y 8x · 3 3 − y 12x · 2 2 = 3y 24x − 2y 24x = y 24x Answer: x 40y ! In Example 5, it was not difficult to imagine the smallest number divisible by both 6 and 9. A similar statement might apply to Example 6. This is not the case in all situations. You Try It!

RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS Solution: In this example, it is not easy to conjure up the smallest number divisible by both 72 and 108. As we shall see, prime factorization will come to the rescue. 72 9 3 3 8 2 4 2 2 108 4 2 2 27 3 9 3 3 Thus, 72 = 23 · 32 and 108 = 22 · 33. Procedure for finding the least common denominator (LCD). To find the least common denominator for two or more fractions, proceed as follows: 1. Prime factor each denominator, putting your answers in exponential form. 2. To determine the LCD, write down each factor that appears in your prime factorizations to the highest power that it appears. Following the procedure above, we list the prime factorization of each denom- inator in exponential form. The highest power of 2 that appears is 23. The highest power of 3 that appears is 33. 72 = 23 · 32 Prime factor 72. 108 = 22 · 33 Prime factor 108. LCD = 23 · 33 Highest power of 2 is 23. Highest power of 3 is 33. Therefore, the LCD is 23 · 33 = 8 · 27 or 216. Hence: 5y 72 − y 108 = 5y 72 · 3 3 − y 108 · 2 2 Make equivalent fractions. = 15y 216 − 2y 216 Simplify. = 13y 216 Subtract numerators.

LCD = 22 · 3 · 5 · x2 · y2 Simplify. LCD = 60x2y2 After making equivalent fractions, place the difference of the numerators over this common denominator. 7 15xy2 − 11 20x2 = 7 15xy2 · 4x 4x − 11 20x2 · 3y 2 3y2 = 28x 60x2y2 − 33y 2 60x2y2 = 28x− 33y2 60x2y2 Answer: 55 + 21x2 90x2y !  || Dividing a Polynomial by a Monomial We know that multiplication is distributive with respect to addition; that is, a(b+ c) = ab+ ac. We use this property to perform multiplications such as: x2(2x2 − 3x− 8) = 2x4 − 3x3 − 8x2 However, it is also true that division is distributive with respect to addition. Distributive property for division. If a, b, and c are any numbers, then: a+ b c = a c + b c 512 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS For example, note that 4 + 6 2 = 4 2 + 6 2 .
