Exceptional Cases In the previous section, we saw that if the substitution method led to a false statement, then we have parallel lines. The same thing can happen with the elimination method of this section. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve the following system of equations.Solve the following system of equations: 5x− 4y = −16 15x− 12y = 49 x+ y = 3 (4.27) 2x+ 2y = −6 (4.28) 4.3. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY ELIMINATION 277 Solution: Let’s focus on eliminating the x-terms. Note that if we multiply equation (4.27) by−2, the x-terms will be eliminated when we add the resulting equations. −2x − 2y = −6 Multiply equation (4.27) by −2. 2x + 2y = −6 Equation (4.28). 0 = −12 Add the equations. Because of our experience with this solving this exceptional case with substi- tution, the fact that both variables have disappeared should not be completely surprising. Note that this last statement is false, regardless of the values of x and y. Hence, the system has no solution. Indeed, if we find the intercepts of each equation and plot them, then we can easily see that the lines of this system are parallel (see Figure 4.43). Parallel lines never intersect, so the system has no solutions. −5 5 −5 5 x y (3, 0) (0, 3) (−3, 0) (0,−3) x+ y = 3 2x+ 2y = −6 Figure 4.43: The lines x+ y = 3 and 2x+ 2y = −6 are parallel. Answer: no solution ! In the previous section, we saw that if the substitution method led to a true statement, then we have the same lines. The same thing can happen with the elimination method of this section. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Solve the following system of equations. Solve the following system of equations: 2x− 7y = 4 8x− 28y = 16 x− 7y = 4 (4.29) −3x+ 21y = −12 (4.30) 278 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS Solution: If we are not on automatic pilot late at night doing our homework, we might recognize that the equations 4.29 and (4.30) are identical. But it’s also conceivable that we don’t see that right away and begin the elimination method. Let’s multiply the first equation by 3, then add. This will eliminate the x-terms. 3x − 21y = 12 Multiply equation (4.29) by 3. −3x + 21y = −12 Equation (4.30). 0 = 0 Add the equations. Again, all of the variables have disappeared! However, this time the last state- ment is true, regardless of the values of x and y. −5 5 x y −3x + 21y = −12 x− 7y = 4 (−3,−1) (0,−4/7) (4, 0) Figure 4.44: x − 7y = 4 and −3x + 21y = −12 are the same line. Infinite number of solutions. Notice that if we multiply equation (4.29) by −3, then we have two identical equations. −3x + 21y = −12 Multiply equation (4.29) by 3. −3x + 21y = −12 Equation (4.30). The equations are identical! Hence, there are an infinite number of points of intersection. Indeed, any point on either line is a solution. Example points of solution are (−3,−1), (0,−4/7), and (4, 0). Answer: There are an infinite number of solutions. Examples of solution points are (2, 0), (9, 2), and (−5,−2). ! 4.3.
