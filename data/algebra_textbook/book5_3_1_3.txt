Equations in Two Variables The equation y = x + 1 is an equation in two variables, in this case x and y.The variables do not have to always be x and y. For example, the equation v = 2+ 3.2t is an equation in two variables, v and t. Consider the point (x, y) = (2, 3). If we substitute 2 for x and 3 for y in the equation y = x+ 1, we get the following result: y = x+ 1 Original equation. 3 = 2 + 1 Substitute: 2 for x, 3 for y. 3 = 3 Simplify both sides. Because the last line is a true statement, we say that (2, 3) is a solution of the equation y = x + 1. Alternately, we say that (2, 3) satisfies the equation y = x+ 1. On the other hand, consider the point (x, y) = (−3, 1). If we substitute −3 for x and 1 for y in the equation y = x+ 1, we get the following result. y = x+ 1 Original equation. 1 = −3 + 1 Substitute: −3 for x, 1 for y. 1 = −2 Simplify both sides. Because the last line is a false statement, the point (−3, 1) is not a solution of the equation y = x+1; that is, the point (−3, 1) does not satisfy the equation y = x+ 1. 3.1. GRAPHING EQUATIONS BY HAND 157 Solutions of an equation in two variables. Given an equation in the variables x and y and a point (x, y) = (a, b), if upon subsituting a for x and b for y a true statement results, then the point (x, y) = (a, b) is said to be a solution of the given equation. Alternately, we say that the point (x, y) = (a, b) satisfies the given equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Which of the ordered pairs (0,−3) and (1, 1) satisfy the Which of the ordered pairs (−1, 3) and (2, 1) satisfy the equation y = 2x+ 5? equation y = 3x− 2? Solution: Substituting the ordered pairs (0,−3) and (1, 1) into the equation y = 3x− 2 lead to the following results: Consider (x, y) = (0,−3). Substitute 0 for x and −3 for y: y = 3x− 2 −3 = 3(0)− 2 −3 = −2 The resulting statement is false. Consider (x, y) = (1, 1). Substitute 1 for x and 1 for y: y = 3x− 2 1 = 3(1)− 2 1 = 1 The resulting statement is true. Thus, the ordered pair (0,−3) does not satisfy the equation y = 3x− 2, but the ordered pair (1, 1) does satisfy the equation y = 3x− 2. Answer: (−1, 3) !
