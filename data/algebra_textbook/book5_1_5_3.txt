Distributing a Negative Sign Recall that negating a number is equivalent to multiplying the number by −1. Multiplicative Property of Minus One. If a is any number, then: (−1)a = −a This means that if we negate an expression, it is equivalent to multiplying the expression by −1. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Expand −(7x− 8y − 10). Expand: −(−a− 2b+ 11) Solution: First, negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. Then we can change subtraction to addition by “adding the opposite” and use the distribu- tive property to finish the expansion. −(7x− 8y − 10) = −1(7x− 8y − 10) Negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1 = −1(7x+ (−8y) + (−10)) Add the opposite. = −1(7x) + (−1)(−8y) + (−1)(−10) Distribute the −1. = −7x+ 8y + 10 Multiply. Thus, −(7x− 8y − 10) = −7x+ 8y + 10. Answer: a+ 2b− 11 ! While being mathematically precise, the technique of Example 7 can be simpli- fied by noting that negating an expression surrounded by parentheses simply changes the sign of each term inside the parentheses to the opposite sign. Once we understand this, we can simply “distribute the minus sign” and write: −(7x− 8y − 10) = −7x+ 8y + 10 In similar fashion, −(−3a+ 5b− c) = 3a− 5b+ c and −(−3x− 8y + 11) = 3x+ 8y − 11. 64 CHAPTER 1.
