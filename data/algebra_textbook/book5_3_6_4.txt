Horizontal and Vertical Lines Here we keep an earlier promise to address what happens to the standard form Ax + By = C when either A = 0 or B = 0. For example, the form 3x = 6, when compared with the standard form Ax + By = C, has B = 0. Similarly, the form 2y = −12, when compared with the standard form Ax + By = C, has A = 0. Of course, 3x = 6 can be simplified to x = 2 and 2y = −12 can be simplified to y = −6. Thus, if either A = 0 or B = 0, the standard form Ax+By = C takes the form x = a and y = b, respectively. As we will see in the next example, the form x = a produces a vertical line, while the form y = b produces a horizontal line. 238 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Sketch the graphs of x = 3 and y = −3.Sketch the graphs of x = −2 and y = 2. Solution: To sketch the graph of x = 3, recall that the graph of an equation is the set of all points that satisfy the equation. Hence, to draw the graph of x = 3, we must plot all of the points that satisfy the equation x = 3; that is, we must plot all of the points that have an x-coordinate equal to 3. The result is shown in Figure 3.99. Secondly, to sketch the graph of y = −3, we plot all points having a y- coordinate equal to −3. The result is shown in Figure 3.100. −5 5 −5 5 x y x = 3 Figure 3.99: The graph of x = 3 is a vertical line. −5 5 −5 5 x y y = −3 Figure 3.100: The graph of y = −3 is a horizontal line. Things to note: A couple of comments are in order regarding the lines in Figures 3.99 and 3.100. 1. The graph of x = 3 in Figure 3.99, being a vertical line, has undefined slope. Therefore, we cannot use either of the formulae y = mx + b or y − y0 = m(x− x0) to obtain the equation of the line. The only way we can obtain the equation is to note that the line is the set of all points (x, y) whose x-coordinate equals 3. 2. However, the graph of y = −3, being a horizontal line, has slope zero, so we can use the slope-intercept form to find the equation of the line. Note that the y-intercept of this graph is (0,−3). If we substitute these numbers into y = mx+ b, we get: y = mx+ b Slope-intercept form. y = 0x+ (−3) Substitute: 0 for m, −3 for b. y = −3 Simplify. 3.6.
