Simplifying Using the Product and Quotient Rule for Radicals It will not always be the case that the radicand is a perfect power of the given index. If not, we use the following two properties to simplify them. If a and b represent positive real numbers, then we have Product rule for radicals a ⋅ b − − − √ n = a √ n ⋅ b √ n , where a and b represent positive real numbers. : a ⋅ b − − − √ n = a √ n ⋅ b √ n Quotient rule for radicals a b − − √ n = a √ n b √ n , where a and b represent positive real numbers. : a b − − √ n = a √ n b √ n A radical is simplified A radical where the radicand does not consist of any factor that can be written as a perfect power of the index. if it does not contain any factor that can be written as a perfect power of the index.   Example 8: Simplify: 12 − − √ . Solution: Here 12 can be written as 4 ⋅ 3, where 4 is a perfect square. We can verify our answer on a calculator: Also, it is worth noting that Answer: 2 3 √   Example 9: Simplify: 135 − − − √ . Solution: Begin by finding the largest perfect square factor of 135. Therefore, Answer: 3 15 − − √   Example 10: Simplify: 50 121 − − − √ . Solution: Begin by finding the prime factorizations of both 50 and 121. This will enable us to easily determine the largest perfect square factors. Therefore, Answer: 5 2 √ 11   Example 11: Simplify: 162 − − − √ 3 . Solution: Use the prime factorization of 162 to find the largest perfect cube factor: Replace the radicand with this factorization and then apply the product rule for radicals. We can verify our answer on a calculator. Answer: 3   6 √ 3   Try this! Simplify: 2   96 − − √ 3 . Answer: 4   12 − − √ 3 Video Solution   Example 12: Simplify: − 96 − − − − √ 5 . Solution: Here we note that the index is odd and the radicand is negative; hence the result will be negative. We can factor the radicand as follows: Then simplify: Answer: − 2   3 √ 5   Example 13: Simplify: − 8 64 − − − − √ 3 . Solution: In this case, consider the equivalent fraction with − 8 = ( − 2 ) 3 in the numerator and then simplify. Answer: −1/2   Try this! Simplify − 108 − − − − √ 3 .
