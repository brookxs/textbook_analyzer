Rounding Using the Graphing Calculator Here is the algorithm for rounding a decimal number to a particular place. Rules for rounding. To round a number to a particular place, follow these steps: 1. Mark the place you wish to round to. The digit in this place is called the rounding digit. 2. Mark the digit in the place to the immediate right of the rounding digit. This is called the test digit. a) If the test digit is greater than or equal to 5, add 1 to the rounding digit, then replace all digits to the right of the rounding digit with zeros. Trailing zeros to the right of the decimal point may be deleted. b) If the test digit is less than 5, keep the rounding digit the same, then replace all digits to the right of the rounding digit with zeros. Trailing zeros to the right of the decimal point may be deleted. You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Use your graphing calculator to evaluate 125x3−17.5x+44.8 at x = −3.13. Round your answer to the nearest tenth. Evaluate x3 − 3x at x = −1.012. Round to the nearest hundredth. Solution. First, store −3.13 in the variable X with the following keystrokes. (-) 3 . 1 3 STO! X,T,θ,n ENTER The result is shown in the first image in Figure 1.15. Next, enter the expression 125x3 − 17.5x+ 44.8 with the following keystrokes. (-) 1 2 5 × X,T,θ,n ∧ 3 − 1 7 . 5 × X,T,θ,n + 4 4 . 8 ENTER The result is shown in the second image in Figure 1.15. Thus, the answer is approximately −3733.462125. We now need to round this answer to the nearest tenth. Mark the rounding digit in the tenths place and the test digit to its immediate right. −3733. 4 6 2125 Rounding digit Test digit 56 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Figure 1.15: Evaluate 125x3 − 17.5x+ 44.8 at x = −3.13. Because the test digit is greater than or equal to 5, add 1 to the rounding digit, then replace all digits to the right of the rounding digit with zeros. −3733.462125≈ −3733.500000 Delete the trailing zeros from end of the fractional part of a decimal. This does not change our answer’s value. −3733.462125≈ −3733.5 Therefore, if x = −3.13. then to the nearest tenth: 125x3 − 17.5x+ 44.8 ≈ −3733.5 Answer: 2.0 ! 1.4. DECIMAL NOTATION 57 ! ! !
