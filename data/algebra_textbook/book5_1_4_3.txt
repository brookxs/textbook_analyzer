Order of Operations Decimal numbers obey the same Rules Guiding Order of Operations as do the integers and fractions. Rules Guiding Order of Operations. When evaluating expressions, pro- ceed in the following order. 1. Evaluate expressions contained in grouping symbols first. If grouping symbols are nested, evaluate the expression in the innermost pair of grouping symbols first. 2. Evaluate all exponents that appear in the expression. 3. Perform all multiplications and divisions in the order that they appear in the expression, moving left to right. 4. Perform all additions and subtractions in the order that they appear in the expression, moving left to right. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Given x = −0.12, evaluate −x2.Given y = −0.2, evaluate: −y4 Solution: Following Tips for Evaluating Algebraic Expressions, first replace all occurrences of variable x in the expression −x2 with open parentheses. Next, 1.4. DECIMAL NOTATION 53 substitute −0.12 for x in the open parentheses, then simplify. −x2 = − ( )2 Replace x with open parentheses. = − (−0.12)2 Substitute −0.12 for x. = −(0.0144) Exponent: (−0.12)2 = 0.0144 = −0.0144 Negate. Note that we square first, then we negate second. Thus, if x = −0.12, then −x2 = −0.0144. Answer: −0.0016 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Given x = −0.3, evaluate 1.2x2 − 3.4x. Given y = −0.15, evaluate: −1.4y2 + 2.2ySolution: Following Tips for Evaluating Algebraic Expressions, first replace all occurrences of variable x in the expression 1.2x2− 3.4x with open parentheses. Next, substitute −0.3 for x in the open parentheses, then simplify. 1.2x2 − 3.4x = 1.2( )2 − 3.4( ) Replace x with parentheses. = 1.2(−0.3)2 − 3.4(−0.3) Substitute −0.3 for x. = 1.2(0.09)− 3.4(−0.3) Exponent: (−0.3)2 = 0.09. = 0.108− (−1.02) Multiply: 1.2(0.09) = 0.108 and 3.4(−0.3) = −1.02. = 0.108 + 1.02 Add the opposite. = 1.128 Simplify. Thus, if x = −0.3, then 1.2x2 − 3.4x = 1.128. Answer: −0.3615 ! We saw earlier that we can change a fraction to a decimal by dividing. You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Given x = 2/5, evaluate −3.2x+ 5. Given y = −3/4, evaluate: −2.3y + 7Solution: Following Tips for Evaluating Algebraic Expressions, first replace all occurrences of variable x in the expression −3.2x+5 with open parentheses. Next, substitute 2/5 for x in the open parentheses. −3.2x+ 5 = −3.2 ( ) + 5 Replace x with open parentheses. = −3.2 ( 2 5 ) + 5 Substitute 2/5 for x. 54 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS One approach is to change 2/5 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator. Thus, 2/5 = 0.4. = −3.2(0.4) + 5 Replace 2/5 with 0.4. = −1.28 + 5 Multiply: −3.2(0.4) = −1.28. = 3.72 Add: −1.28 + 5 = 3.72. Thus, if x = 2/5, then −3.2x+ 5 = 3.72.Answer: 8.725 ! As we saw in Example 2, we can easily change a terminating decimal into a fraction by placing the number (without the decimal point) over the proper power of ten. The choice of the power of ten should match the number of digits to the right of the decimal point. For example: 0.411 = 411 1000 and 3.11 = 311 100 and 15.1111 = 151111 10000 Note that the number of zeros in each denominator matches the number of digits to the right of the decimal point.

Next, substitute −0.25 for y in the open parentheses. −3 5 y + 4 = −3 5 ( ) + 4 Replace y with open parentheses. = −3 5 (−0.25) + 4 Substitute −0.25 for y. Place 25 over 100 to determine that −0.25 = −25/100, or after reduction, −0.25 = −1/4. = −3 5 ( −1 4 ) + 4 Replace −0.25 with −1/4. = 3 20 + 4 Multiply: −3 5 ( −1 4 ) = 3 20 . = 3 20 + 80 20 Make equivalent fractions with LCD. = 83 20 Add.
