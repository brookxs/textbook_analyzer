Coordinates of a Point Coordinates of a Point The numbers in an ordered pair that are associated with a particular point are called the coordinates of the point. The first number in the ordered pair expresses the point’s horizontal distance and direction (left or right) from the origin. The second number expresses the point’s vertical distance and direction (up or down) from the origin. The Coordinates Determine Distance and Direction A positive number means a direction to the right or up. A negative number means a direction to the left or down.
