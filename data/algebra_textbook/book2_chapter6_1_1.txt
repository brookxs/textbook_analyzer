GCF of Natural Numbers The process of writing a number or expression as a product is called factoring The process of writing a number or expression as a product. . If we write 60 = 5 ⋅ 12, we say that the product 5 ⋅ 12 is a factorization Any combination of factors, multiplied together, resulting in the product. of 60 and that 5 and 12 are factors Any of the numbers or expressions that form a product. . Typically, there are many ways to factor a number. For example, Recall that a prime number is defined as a natural number with exactly two natural number factors, 1 and itself. The first ten prime numbers follow: Any natural number greater than 1 can be uniquely written as a product of prime numbers. This product is called the prime factorization The unique factorization of a natural number written as a product of primes. . The prime factorization of 60 can be determined by continuing to factor until only a product of prime numbers remains. Since the prime factorization is unique, it does not matter how we choose to initially factor the number; the end result will be the same. The prime factorization of 60 follows: Recall that the greatest common factor (GCF) The product of all the common prime factors. of any two natural numbers is the product of all the common prime factors.   Example 1: Find the GCF of 60 and 140. Solution: First, determine the prime factorizations of both integers. The product of the common prime factors is 2 2 ⋅ 5 ; hence the GCF ( 60 ,   140 ) = 2 2 ⋅ 5 = 20 . To see that it is the greatest common factor, we can write the following: Answer: The greatest common factor of 60 and 140 is 20.   Example 2: Find the GCF of 504 and 1,080. Solution: First, determine the prime factorizations of both integers. The product of the common prime factors is 2 3 ⋅ 3 2 . The GCF ( 504 ,   1080 ) = 2 3 ⋅ 3 2 = 72 . Note that we multiplied the common prime factors with the smallest exponent. The numbers 7 and 15 share no common natural number factor other than 1; we say that they are relatively prime Expressions that share no common factors other than 1. . Answer: The greatest common factor of 504 and 1,080 is 72.
