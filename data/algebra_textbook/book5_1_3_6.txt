Fractions on the Graphing Calculator We must always remember that the graphing calculator is an “approximating machine.” In a small number of situations, it is capable of giving an exact answer, but for most calculations, the best we can hope for is an approximate answer. However, the calculator gives accurate results for operations involving frac- tions, as long as we don’t use fractions with denominators that are too large for the calculator to respond with an exact answer. 40 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Use the graphing calculator to simplify each of the followingSimplify using the graphing calculator: −4 5 + 8 3 expressions: (a) 2 3 + 1 2 (b) 2 3 · 5 7 (c) 3 5 ÷ 1 3 Solution: We enter each expression in turn. a) The Rules Guiding Order of Operations tell us that we must perform divi- sions before additions. Thus, the expression 2/3 + 1/2 is equivalent to: 2/3 + 1/2 = 2 3 + 1 2 Divide first. = 4 6 + 3 6 Equivalent fractions with LCD. = 7 6 Add. Enter the expression 2/3+1/2 on your calculator, then press the ENTER key. The result is shown in the first image in Figure 1.12. Next, press the MATH button, then select 1:"Frac (see the second image in Figure 1.12) and press the ENTER key again. Note that the result shown in the third image in Figure 1.12 matches the correct answer of 7/6 found above. Figure 1.12: Calculating 2/3 + 1/2. b) The Rules Guiding Order of Operations tell us that there is no preference for division over multiplication, or vice-versa. We must perform divisions and multiplications as they occur, moving from left to right. Hence: 2/3× 5/7 = 2 3 × 5/7 Divide: 2/3 = 2 3 = 10 3 /7 Multiply: 2 3 × 5 = 10 3 = 10 3 × 1 7 Invert and multiply. = 10 21 Multiply: 10 3 × 1 7 = 10 21 1.3. THE RATIONAL NUMBERS 41 This is precisely the same result we get when we perform the following calculation. 2 3 × 5 7 = 10 21 Multiply numerators and denominators. Hence: 2/3× 5/7 is equivalent to 2 3 × 5 7 Enter the expression 2/3×5/7 on your calculator, then press the ENTER key. The result is shown in the first image in Figure 1.13. Next, press the MATH button, then select 1:"Frac (see the second image in Figure 1.13) and press the ENTER key again. Note that the result shown in the third image in Figure 1.13 matches the correct answer of 10/21 found above. Figure 1.13: Calculating 2/3× 1/2. c) This example demonstrates that we need a constant reminder of the Rules Guiding Order of Operations. We know we need to invert and multiply in this situation. 3 5 ÷ 1 3 = 3 5 × 3 1 Invert and multiply. = 9 5 Multiply numerators and denominators. So, the correct answer is 9/5. Enter the expression 3/5/1/3 on your calculator, then press the ENTER key. Select 1:"Frac from the MATH menu and press the ENTER key again. Note that the result in the first image in Figure 1.14 does not match the correct answer of 9/5 found above. What have we done wrong? If we follow the Rules Guiding Order of Operations exactly, then: 3/5/1/3 = 3 5 /1/3 Divide: 3/5 = 3 5 = 3 5 /3 Divide: 3 5 /1 = 3 5 = 3 5 × 1 3 Invert and multiply. = 1 5 Multiply: 3 5 × 1 3 = 1 5 42 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS This explains the answer found in the first image in Figure 1.14. However, it also show that: 3/5/1/3 is not equivalent to 3 5 ÷ 1 3 We can cure the problem by using grouping symbols. (3/5)/(1/3) = 3 5 / 1 3 Parentheses first. = 3 5 ÷ 1 3 / is equivalent to ÷. Hence: (3/5)/(1/3) is equivalent to 3 5 ÷ 1 3 Enter the expression (3/5)/(1/3) on your calculator, then press the EN- TER key. Select 1:"Frac from the MATH menu and press the ENTER key again. Note that the result in the second image in Figure 1.14 matches the correct answer of 9/5. Figure 1.14: Calculating (3/5)/(1/3). Answer: 28/15 ! 1.3. THE RATIONAL NUMBERS 43 ! ! !
