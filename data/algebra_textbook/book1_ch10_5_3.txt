The Method Of Completing The Square Now, with these observations, we can describe the method of completing the square. The Method of Completing the Square Write the equation so that the constant term appears on the right side of equation. If the leading coefficient is different from 1, divide each term of the equation by that coefficient. Take one half of the coefficient of the linear term, square it, then add it to both sides of the equation. The trinomial on the left is now a perfect square trinomial and can be factored as ( ) 2 . The first term in the parentheses is the square root of the quadratic term. The last term in the parentheses is one-half the coefficient of the linear term. Solve this equation by extraction of roots. The Method Of Completing The Square Now, with these observations, we can describe the method of completing the square.
