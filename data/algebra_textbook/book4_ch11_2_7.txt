Numerical Evaluation We know that a variable represents an unknown quantity. Therefore, any expres­sion that contains a variable represents an unknown quantity. For example, if the value of is unknown, then the value of is unknown. The value of depends on the value of . Numerical Evaluation Numerical evaluation is the process of determining the numerical value of an algebraic expression by replacing the variables in the expression with specified numbers. Sample Set B Find the value of each expression. Example 11.6.  , if and Replace x with –4 and y with 2. Thus, when and , . Example 11.7.  , if and = . Replace a with 6 and b with –3. Thus, when a = 6 and b = –3, . Example 11.8.  , if and Replace with –5 and with –1. Thus, when and , . Example 11.9.  , if Replace x with 4. Thus, when , . Example 11.10.  , if Replace x with 3. Example 11.11.  , if . Replace x with 3. The exponent is connected to –3, not 3 as in the problem above. Practice Set B Find the value of each expression. Exercise 11.2.6.
