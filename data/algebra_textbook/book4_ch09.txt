 ||  || Measurement There are two major systems of measurement in use today. They are the United States system and the metric system. Before we describe these systems, let's gain a clear understanding of the concept of measurement. Measurement Measurement is comparison to some standard. Standard Unit of Measure The concept of measurement is based on the idea of direct comparison. This means that measurement is the result of the comparison of two quantities. The quantity that is used for comparison is called the standard unit of measure. Over the years, standards have changed. Quite some time in the past, the stan­dard unit of measure was determined by a king. For example, 1 inch was the distance between the tip of the thumb and the knuckle of the king. 1 inch was also the length of 16 barley grains placed end to end. Today, standard units of measure rarely change. Standard units of measure are the responsibility of the Bureau of Standards in Washington D.C. Some desirable properties of a standard are the following: Accessibility. We should have access to the standard so we can make comparisons. Invariance. We should be confident that the standard is not subject to change. Reproducibility. We should be able to reproduce the standard so that measure­ments are convenient and accessible to many people.  || The United States System of Measurement Some of the common units (along with their abbreviations) for the United States system of measurement are listed in the following table. Table 9.1. Unit Conversion Table Length 1 foot (ft) = 12 inches (in.) 1 yard (yd) = 3 feet (ft) 1 mile (mi) = 5,280 feet Weight 1 pound (lb) =16 ounces (oz) 1 ton (T) = 2,000 pounds Liquid Volume 1 tablespoon (tbsp) = 3 teaspoons (tsp) 1 fluid ounce (fl oz) = 2 tablespoons 1 cup (c) = 8 fluid ounces 1 pint (pt) = 2 cups1 quart (qt) = 2 pints1 gallon (gal) = 4 quarts Time 1 minute (min) = 60 seconds (sec) 1 hour ( hr) = 60 minutes1 day (da) = 24 hours1 week (wk) = 7 days  || Conversions in the United States System It is often convenient or necessary to convert from one unit of measure to another. For example, it may be convenient to convert a measurement of length that is given in feet to one that is given in inches. Such conversions can be made using unit fractions. Unit Fraction A unit fraction is a fraction with a value of 1. Unit fractions are formed by using two equal measurements. One measurement is placed in the numerator of the fraction, and the other in the denominator. Place­ment depends on the desired conversion. Placement of Units Place the unit being converted to in the numerator. Place the unit being converted from in the denominator. For example, Table 9.2. Equal Measurements Unit Fraction 1ft = 12in. 1pt = 16 fl oz 1wk = 7da Sample Set A Make the following conversions. If a fraction occurs, convert it to a decimal rounded to two decimal places. Example 9.1.  Convert 11 yards to feet. Looking in the unit conversion table under length, we see that 1 yd = 3 ft. There are two corresponding unit fractions, and . Which one should we use? Look to see which unit we wish to convert to. Choose the unit fraction with this unit in the numerator. We will choose since this unit fraction has feet in the numerator. Now, multiply 11 yd by the unit fraction. Notice that since the unit fraction has the value of 1, multiplying by it does not change the value of 11 yd. Thus, 11 yd = 33ft. Example 9.2.  Convert 36 fl oz to pints. Looking in the unit conversion table under liquid volume, we see that 1 pt = 16 fl oz. Since we are to convert to pints, we will construct a unit fraction with pints in the numerator. Thus, 36 fl oz = 2.25 pt. Example 9.3.  Convert 2,016 hr to weeks. Looking in the unit conversion table under time, we see that 1wk = 7da and that 1 da = 24 hr. To convert from hours to weeks, we must first convert from hours to days and then from days to weeks. We need two unit fractions. The unit fraction needed for converting from hours to days is . The unit fraction needed for converting from days to weeks is . Thus, 2,016 hr = 12 wk. Practice Set A Make the following conversions. If a fraction occurs, convert it to a decimal rounded to two decimal places. Exercise 9.2.1. (Go to Solution) Convert 18 ft to yards. Exercise 9.2.2. (Go to Solution) Convert 2 mi to feet. Exercise 9.2.3. (Go to Solution) Convert 26 ft to yards. Exercise 9.2.4. (Go to Solution) Convert 9 qt to pints. Exercise 9.2.5. (Go to Solution) Convert 52 min to hours. Exercise 9.2.6. (Go to Solution) Convert 412 hr to weeks.  ||  || The Advantages of the Base Ten Number System The metric system of measurement takes advantage of our base ten number sys­tem. The advantage of the metric system over the United States system is that in the metric system it is possible to convert from one unit of measure to another simply by multiplying or dividing the given number by a power of 10. This means we can make a conversion simply by moving the decimal point to the right or the left.  || Prefixes Common units of measure in the metric system are the meter (for length), the liter (for volume), and the gram (for mass). To each of the units can be attached a prefix. The metric prefixes along with their meaning are listed below. kilo — thousand deci — tenth hecto — hundred centi — hundredth deka — ten milli — thousandth For example, if length is being measured, 1 kilometer is equivalent to 1000 meters. 1 centimeter is equivalent to one hundredth of a meter. 1 millimeter is equivalent to one thousandth of a meter.  || Conversion from One Unit to Another Unit Let's note three characteristics of the metric system that occur in the metric table of measurements. In each category, the prefixes are the same. We can move from a larger to a smaller unit of measure by moving the decimal point to the right. We can move from a smaller to a larger unit of measure by moving the decimal point to the left. The following table provides a summary of the relationship between the basic unit of measure (meter, gram, liter) and each prefix, and how many places the decimal point is moved and in what direction. kilo hecto deka unit deci centi milli Table 9.3. Basic Unit to Prefix   Move the Decimal Point unit to deka 1 to 10 1 place to the left unit to hector 1 to 100 2 places to the left unit to kilo 1 to 1,000 3 places to the left unit to deci 1 to 0.1 1 place to the right unit to centi 1 to 0.01 2 places to the right unit to milli 1 to 0.001 3 places to the right  || Conversion Table Listed below, in the unit conversion table, are some of the common metric units of measure. Table 9.4. Unit Conversion Table Length 1   kilometer  ( km ) = 1,000 meters  ( m ) 1, 000 × 1 m 1   hectometer  ( hm ) = 100 meters 100 × 1 m 1   dekameter  ( dam ) = 10 meters 10 × 1 m 1 meter (m) 1 × 1 m . 1 × 1 m . 01 × 1 m . 001 × 1 m Mass 1   kilogram   ( kg ) = 1,000 grams   ( g ) 1, 000 × 1 g 1   hectogram  ( hg ) = 100 grams 100 × 1 g 1   dekagram   ( dag ) = 10 grams 10 × 1 g 1   gram   (g) 1 × 1 g . 1 × 1 g . 01 × 1 g . 001 × 1 g Volume 1   kiloliter   ( kL ) = 1, 000   liters   ( L ) 1, 000 × 1 L 1   hectoliter   ( hL ) = 100   liters 100 × 1 L 1   dekaliter   ( daL ) = 10   liters 10 × 1 L 1 liter (L) 1 × 1 L . 1 × 1 L . 01 × 1 L . 001 × 1 L Time Same as the United States system   Distinction Between Mass and Weight There is a distinction between mass and weight. The weight of a body is related to gravity whereas the mass of a body is not. For example, your weight on the earth is different than it is on the moon, but your mass is the same in both places. Mass is a measure of a body's resistance to motion. The more massive a body, the more resistant it is to motion. Also, more massive bodies weigh more than less massive bodies. Converting Metric Units To convert from one metric unit to another metric unit: Determine the location of the original number on the metric scale (pictured in each of the following examples). Move the decimal point of the original number in the same direction and same number of places as is necessary to move to the metric unit you wish to go to. We can also convert from one metric unit to another using unit fractions. Both methods are shown in Example 9.4 of the section called “Sample Set A”. Sample Set A Example 9.4.  Convert 3 kilograms to grams. 3 kg can be written as 3.0 kg. Then, Thus, 3kg = 3,000 g. We can also use unit fractions to make this conversion. Since we are converting to grams, and 1,000    g = 1   kg, we choose the unit fraction since grams is in the numerator. Example 9.5.  Convert 67.2 hectoliters to milliliters. Thus, 67.2 hL = 6,720,000 mL. Example 9.6.  Convert 100.07 centimeters to meters. Thus, 100.07 cm = 1.0007 m. Example 9.7.  Convert 0.16 milligrams to grams. Thus, 0.16   mg = 0.00016 g. Practice Set A Exercise 9.3.1. (Go to Solution) Convert 411 kilograms to grams. Exercise 9.3.2. (Go to Solution) Convert 5.626 liters to centiliters. Exercise 9.3.3. (Go to Solution) Convert 80 milliliters to kiloliters. Exercise 9.3.4. (Go to Solution) Convert 150 milligrams to centigrams. Exercise 9.3.5. (Go to Solution) Convert 2.5 centimeters to meters.  ||  || Converting to Multiple Units Denominate Numbers Numbers that have units of measure associated with them are called denominate numbers. It is often convenient, or even necessary, to simplify a denominate number. Simplified Denominate Number A denominate number is simplified when the number of standard units of measure associated With it does not exceed the next higher type of unit. The denominate number 55 min is simplified since it is smaller than the next higher type of unit, 1 hr. The denominate number 65 min is not simplified since it is not smaller than the next higher type of unit, 1 hr. The denominate number 65 min can be simplified to 1 hr 5 min. The denominate number 1 hr 5 min is simplified since the next higher type of unit is day, and 1 hr does not exceed 1 day. Sample Set A Example 9.8.  Simplify 19 in. Since 12  in. = 1 ft, and 19 = 12 + 7, Example 9.9.  Simplify 4 gal 5 qt. Since 4  qt = 1 gal, and 5 = 4 + 1, Example 9.10.  Simplify 2 hr 75 min. Since 60 min = 1 hr, and 75 = 60 + 15, Example 9.11.  Simplify 43 fl oz. Since 8 fl oz = 1 c (1 cup), and 43÷8 = 5 R3, But, 2 c = 1 pt and 5÷2 = 2 R1. So, But, 2 pt = 1 qt, so 2 pt + 1 c + 3 fl oz = 1 qt 1 c 3 fl oz Practice Set A Simplify each denominate number. Refer to the conversion tables given in Section 9.2, if necessary. Exercise 9.4.1. (Go to Solution) 18 in. Exercise 9.4.2. (Go to Solution) 8 gal 9 qt Exercise 9.4.3. (Go to Solution) 5 hr 80 min Exercise 9.4.4. (Go to Solution) 8 wk 11 da Exercise 9.4.5. (Go to Solution) 86 da  || Adding and Subtracting Denominate Numbers Adding and Subtracting Denominate Numbers Denominate numbers can be added or subtracted by: writing the numbers vertically so that the like units appear in the same column. adding or subtracting the number parts, carrying along the unit. simplifying the sum or difference. Sample Set B Example 9.12.  Add 6 ft 8 in. to 2 ft 9 in. Since 12 in. = 1 ft, Example 9.13.  Subtract 5 da 3 hr from 8 da 11 hr. Example 9.14.  Subtract 3 lb 14 oz from 5 lb 3 oz. We cannot directly subtract 14 oz from 3 oz, so we must borrow 16 oz from the pounds. Example 9.15.  Subtract 4 da 9 hr 21 min from 7 da 10 min. Borrow 1 da from the 7 da. Borrow 1 hr from the 24 hr. Practice Set B Perform each operation. Simplify when possible. Exercise 9.4.6. (Go to Solution) Add 4 gal 3 qt to 1 gal 2 qt. Exercise 9.4.7. (Go to Solution) Add 9 hr 48 min to 4 hr 26 min. Exercise 9.4.8. (Go to Solution) Subtract 2 ft 5 in. from 8 ft 7 in. Exercise 9.4.9. (Go to Solution) Subtract 15 km 460 m from 27 km 800 m. Exercise 9.4.10. (Go to Solution) Subtract 8 min 35 sec from 12 min 10 sec. Exercise 9.4.11. (Go to Solution) Add 4 yd 2 ft 7 in. to 9 yd 2 ft 8 in. Exercise 9.4.12. (Go to Solution) Subtract 11 min 55 sec from 25 min 8 sec.  || Multiplying a Denominate Number by a Whole Number Let's examine the repeated sum Recalling that multiplication is a description of repeated addition, by the distribu­tive property we have From these observations, we can suggest the following rule. Multiplying a Denominate Number by a Whole Number To multiply a denominate number by a whole number, multiply the number part of each unit by the whole number and affix the unit to this product. Sample Set C Perform the following multiplications. Simplify if necessary. Example 9.16.  Since 3 ft = 1 yd and 12  in. = 1 ft, Example 9.17.  Practice Set C Perform the following multiplications. Simplify. Exercise 9.4.13. (Go to Solution) 2⋅(10 min) Exercise 9.4.14. (Go to Solution) 5⋅(3 qt) Exercise 9.4.15. (Go to Solution) 4⋅(5 ft 8 in.) Exercise 9.4.16. (Go to Solution) 10⋅(2 hr 15 min 40 sec)  || Dividing a Denominate Number by a Whole Number Dividing a Denominate Number by a Whole Number To divide a denominate number by a whole number, divide the number part of each unit by the whole number beginning with the largest unit. Affix the unit to this quotient. Carry any remainder to the next unit. Sample Set D Perform the following divisions. Simplify if necessary. Example 9.18.  (12 min 40 sec)÷4 Thus (12 min 40 sec)÷4 = 3 min 10 sec Example 9.19.  (5 yd 2 ft 9 in.)÷3 Thus (5 yd 2 ft 9 in.)÷3 = 1 yd 2 ft 11 in. Practice Set D Perform the following divisions. Simplify if necessary. Exercise 9.4.17. (Go to Solution) (18 hr 36 min)÷9 Exercise 9.4.18. (Go to Solution) (34 hr 8 min.)÷8 Exercise 9.4.19. (Go to Solution) (13 yd 7 in.)÷5 Exercise 9.4.20. (Go to Solution) (47 gal 2 qt 1 pt)÷3  ||  || Polygons We can make use of conversion skills with denominate numbers to make measure­ments of geometric figures such as rectangles, triangles, and circles. To make these measurements we need to be familiar with several definitions. Polygon A polygon is a closed plane (flat) figure whose sides are line segments (portions of straight lines). Polygons Not polygons  || Perimeter Perimeter The perimeter of a polygon is the distance around the polygon. To find the perimeter of a polygon, we simply add up the lengths of all the sides. Sample Set A Find the perimeter of each polygon. Example 9.20.  Example 9.21.  Example 9.22.  Our first observation is that three of the dimensions are missing. However, we can determine the missing measurements using the following process. Let A, B, and C represent the missing measurements. Visualize A = 12m – 2m = 10m B = 9m + 1m – 2m = 8m C = 12m – 1m = 11m Practice Set A Find the perimeter of each polygon. Exercise 9.5.1. (Go to Solution) Exercise 9.5.2. (Go to Solution) Exercise 9.5.3. (Go to Solution)  || Circumference/Diameter/Radius Circumference The circumference of a circle is the distance around the circle. Diameter A diameter of a circle is any line segment that passes through the center of the circle and has its endpoints on the circle. Radius A radius of a circle is any line segment having as its endpoints the center of the circle and a point on the circle. The radius is one half the diameter.  || The Number π The symbol π , read "pi," represents the nonterminating, nonrepeating decimal number 3.14159 … . This number has been computed to millions of decimal places without the appearance of a repeating block of digits. For computational purposes, π is often approximated as 3.14. We will write π ≈ 3.14 to denote that π is approximately equal to 3.14. The symbol "≈" means "approximately equal to."  || Formulas To find the circumference of a circle, we need only know its diameter or radius. We then use a formula for computing the circumference of the circle. Formula A formula is a rule or method for performing a task. In mathematics, a formula is a rule that directs us in computations. Formulas are usually composed of letters that represent important, but possibly unknown, quantities. If C , d , and r represent, respectively, the circumference, diameter, and radius of a circle, then the following two formulas give us directions for computing the circum­ference of the circle. Circumference Formulas C = π d or C ≈ (3.14)d C = 2 π r or C ≈ 2(3.14)r Sample Set B Example 9.23.  Find the exact circumference of the circle. Use the formula C = π d . By commutativity of multiplication, , exactly This result is exact since π has not been approximated. Example 9.24.  Find the approximate circumference of the circle. Use the formula C = π d . C ≈ ( 3 . 14 ) ( 6 . 2 ) C ≈ 19 . 648   mm This result is approximate since π has been approximated by 3.14. Example 9.25.  Find the approximate circumference of a circle with radius 18 inches. Since we're given that the radius, r , is 18 in., we'll use the formula C = 2 π r . C ≈ (2) ( 3 . 14 ) ( 18   in . ) C ≈ 113 . 04   in . Example 9.26.  Find the approximate perimeter of the figure. We notice that we have two semicircles (half circles). The larger radius is 6.2 cm. The smaller radius is 6.2 cm - 2.0 cm = 4.2 cm. The width of the bottom part of the rectangle is 2.0 cm.

(Go to Solution) Find the approximate circumference of the circle with radius 20.1 m. Exercise 9.5.7. (Go to Solution) Find the approximate outside perimeter of  ||  || The Meaning and Notation for Area The product (length unit)⋅(length unit) = (length unit)2 , or, square length unit (sq length unit), can be interpreted physically as the area of a surface. Area The area of a surface is the amount of square length units contained in the surface. For example, 3 sq in. means that 3 squares, 1 inch on each side, can be placed precisely on some surface. (The squares may have to be cut and rearranged so they match the shape of the surface.) We will examine the area of the following geometric figures.  || Area Formulas We can determine the areas of these geometric figures using the following formulas. Table 9.5.   Figure Area Formula Statement Triangle Area of a triangle is one half the base times the height. Rectangle A R = l ⋅ w Area of a rectangle is the length times the width. Parallelogram A P = b ⋅ h Area of a parallelogram is base times the height. Trapezoid Area of a trapezoid is one half the sum of the two bases times the height. Circle A C = πr 2 Area of a circle is π times the square of the radius.  || Finding Areas of Some Common Geometric Figures Sample Set A Example 9.27.  Find the area of the triangle. The area of this triangle is 60 sq ft, which is often written as 60 ft2. Example 9.28.  Find the area of the rectangle. Let's first convert 4 ft 2 in. to inches. Since we wish to convert to inches, we'll use the unit fraction since it has inches in the numerator. Then, Thus, 4 ft 2 in. = 48 in. + 2 in. = 50 in. The area of this rectangle is 400 sq in. Example 9.29.  Find the area of the parallelogram. The area of this parallelogram is 63.86 sq cm. Example 9.30.  Find the area of the trapezoid. The area of this trapezoid is 71.545 sq mm. Example 9.31.  Find the approximate area of the circle. The area of this circle is approximately 886.23 sq ft. Practice Set A Find the area of each of the following geometric figures. Exercise 9.6.1.

(Go to Solution)  || The Meaning and Notation for Volume The product (length unit)(length unit)(length unit) = (length unit)3 , or cubic length unit (cu length unit), can be interpreted physically as the volume of a three-dimensional object. Volume The volume of an object is the amount of cubic length units contained in the object. For example, 4 cu mm means that 4 cubes, 1 mm on each side, would precisely fill some three-dimensional object. (The cubes may have to be cut and rearranged so they match the shape of the object.)  || Volume Formulas Table 9.6.   Figure Volume Formula Statement Rectangular solid The volume of a rectangular solid is the length times the width times the height. Sphere The volume of a sphere is times π times the cube of the radius. Cylinder The volume of a cylinder is π times the square of the radius times the height. Cone The volume of a cone is times π times the square of the radius times the height.  || Finding Volumes of Some Common Geometric Objects Sample Set B Example 9.32.  Find the volume of the rectangular solid. The volume of this rectangular solid is 270 cu in. Example 9.33.  Find the approximate volume of the sphere. The approximate volume of this sphere is 904.32 cu cm, which is often written as 904.32 cm3. Example 9.34.  Find the approximate volume of the cylinder. The volume of this cylinder is approximately 588.05292 cu ft. The volume is approximate because we approximated π with 3.14. Example 9.35.  Find the approximate volume of the cone. Round to two decimal places. The volume of this cone is approximately 20.93 cu mm. The volume is approximate because we approximated π with 3.14. Practice Set B Find the volume of each geometric object. If π is required, approximate it with 3.14 and find the approximate volume. Exercise 9.6.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 9.6.8.
