Perfect Square Trinomials Recall the process of squaring a binomial. Table 6.1. Our Method Is We Notice Square the first term. The first term of the product should be a perfect square. Take the product of the two terms and double it. The middle term of the product should be divisible by 2 (since it’s multiplied by 2). Square the last term. The last term of the product should be a perfect square. Perfect square trinomials always factor as the square of a binomial. To recognize a perfect square trinomial, look for the following features: The first and last terms are perfect squares. The middle term is divisible by 2, and if we divide the middle term in half (the opposite of doubling it), we will get the product of the terms that when squared produce the first and last terms. In other words, factoring a perfect square trinomial amounts to finding the terms that, when squared, produce the first and last terms of the trinomial, and substituting into one of the formula Perfect Square Trinomials Recall the process of squaring a binomial.
