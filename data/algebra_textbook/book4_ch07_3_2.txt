Ratios, Rates, and Proportions Ratio, Rate We have defined a ratio as a comparison, by division, of two pure numbers or two like denominate numbers. We have defined a rate as a comparison, by division, of two unlike denominate numbers. Proportion A proportion is a statement that two ratios or rates are equal. The following two examples show how to read proportions. Sample Set A Write or read each proportion. Example 7.9.  3 is to 5 as 12 is to 20 Example 7.10.  10 items is to 5 dollars as 2 items is to 1 dollar Example 7.11.  8 is to 12 as 16 is to 24. Example 7.12.  50 milligrams of vitamin C is to 1 tablet as 300 milligrams of vitamin C is to 6 tablets. Practice Set A Write or read each proportion. Exercise 7.3.1. (Go to Solution) Exercise 7.3.2. (Go to Solution) Exercise 7.3.3. (Go to Solution) 15 is to 4 as 75 is to 20. Exercise 7.3.4. (Go to Solution) 2 plates are to 1 tray as 20 plates are to 10 trays.
