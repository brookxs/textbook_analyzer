 ||  || Algebraic Expressions Algebraic Expression An algebraic expression is a number, a letter, or a collection of numbers and letters along with meaningful signs of operation. Expressions Algebraic expressions are often referred to simply as expressions, as in the following examples: Example 4.1.  x + 4 is an expression. Example 4.2.  7y is an expression. Example 4.3.  is an expression. Example 4.4.  The number 8 is an expression. 8 can be written with explicit signs of operation by writing it as 8 + 0 or 8⋅1 . 3x 2 + 6 = 4x − 1 is not an expression, it is an equation. We will study equations in the next section.  || Terms and Factors Terms In an algebraic expression, the quantities joined by " + " signs are called terms. In some expressions it will appear that terms are joined by " − " signs. We must keep in mind that subtraction is addition of the negative, that is, a − b = a + ( − b) . An important concept that all students of algebra must be aware of is the difference between terms and factors. Factors Any numbers or symbols that are multiplied together are factors of their product. Terms are parts of sums and are therefore joined by addition (or subtraction) signs.Factors are parts of products and are therefore joined by multiplication signs.  || Common Factors Common Factors Sometimes, when we observe an expression carefully, we will notice that some particular factor appears in every term. When we observe this, we say we are observing common factors. We use the phrase common factors since the particular factor we observe is common to all the terms in the expression. The factor appears in each and every term in the expression.  || Coefficients Coefficient In algebra, as we now know, a letter is often used to represent some quantity. Suppose we represent some quantity by the letter x . The notation 5x means x + x + x + x + x . We can now see that we have five of these quantities. In the expression 5x , the number 5 is called the numerical coefficient of the quantity x . Often, the numerical coefficient is just called the coefficient. The coefficient of a quantity records how many of that quantity there are.  ||  || Equations Equation An equation is a statement that two algebraic expressions are equal. An equation is composed of three parts. Each of the boxes represents an algebraic expression. An equation consists of two expressions separated by an equal sign. The equal sign makes the statement that the two expressions are equivalent, that is, they represent the same value. For example: Example 4.32.  f = 32a .The equation expresses the relationship between the variables f and a . It states that the value of f is always 32 times that of a . Example 4.33.  y = 6x + 8 .The equation expresses the relationship between the variables x and y . It states that the value of y is always 8 more than 6 times the value of x .  || Numerical Evaluation Numerical evaluation Numerical evaluation is the process of determining a value by substituting numbers for letters. Formulas In various areas (business, statistics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, sociology, psychology, etc.), particular equations occur quite frequently. Such equations are called formulas. Numerical evaluation is used frequently with formulas.  ||  || Polynomials Polynomials Let us consider the collection of all algebraic expressions that do not contain variables in the denominators of fractions and where all exponents on the variable quantities are whole numbers. Expressions in this collection are called polynomials. Some expressions that are polynomials are Example 4.38.  3x 4 Example 4.39.  .A fraction occurs, but no variable appears in the denominator. Example 4.40.  5x 3 + 3x 2 − 2x + 1 Some expressions that are not polynomials are Example 4.41.  .A variable appears in the denominator. Example 4.42.  4x 2 − 5x + x − 3 .A negative exponent appears on a variable.  || Classification of Polynomials Polynomials can be classified using two criteria: the number of terms and degree of the polynomial. Table 4.1. Number of Terms Name Example Comment One Monomial 4x 2 mono means “one” in Greek. Two Binomial 4x 2 − 7x bi means “two” in Latin. Three Trinomial 4x 2 − 7x + 3 tri means “three” in Greek. Four or more Polynomial 4x 3 − 7x 2 + 3x − 1 poly means “many” in Greek. Degree of a Term Containing One Variable The degree of a term containing only one variable is the value of the exponent of the variable. Exponents appearing on numbers do not affect the degree of the term. We consider only the exponent of the variable. For example: Example 4.43.  5x 3 is a monomial of degree 3. Example 4.44.  60a 5 is a monomial of degree 5. Example 4.45.  21b 2 is a monomial of degree 2. Example 4.46.  8 is a monomial of degree 0. We say that a nonzero number is a term of 0 degree since it could be written as 8x 0 . Since x 0 = 1(x ≠ 0) , 8x 0 = 8 . The exponent on the variable is 0 so it must be of degree 0. (By convention, the number 0 has no degree.) Example 4.47.  4x is a monomial of the first degree. 4x could be written as 4x 1 . The exponent on the variable is 1 so it must be of the first degree. Degree of a Term Containing Several Variables The degree of a term containing more than one variable is the sum of the exponents of the variables, as shown below. Example 4.48.  4x 2 y 5 is a monomial of degree 2 + 5 = 7 . This is a 7th degree monomial. Example 4.49.  37a b 2 c 6 d 3 is a monomial of degree 1 + 2 + 6 + 3 = 12 . This is a 12th degree monomial. Example 4.50.  5x y is a monomial of degree 1 + 1 = 2 . This is a 2nd degree monomial. Degree of a Polynomial The degree of a polynomial is the degree of the term of highest degree; for example: Example 4.51.  2x 3 + 6x − 1 is a trinomial of degree 3. The first term, 2x 3 , is the term of the highest degree. Therefore, its degree is the degree of the polynomial. Example 4.52.  7y − 10y 4 is a binomial of degree 4. Example 4.53.  a − 4 + 5a 2 is a trinomial of degree 2. Example 4.54.  2x 6 + 9x 4 − x 7 − 8x 3 + x − 9 is a polynomial of degree 7. Example 4.55.  4x 3 y 5 − 2x y 3 is a binomial of degree 8. The degree of the first term is 8. Example 4.56.  3x + 10 is a binomial of degree 1. Linear Quadratic Cubic Polynomials of the first degree are called linear polynomials.Polynomials of the second degree are called quadratic polynomials.Polynomials of the third degree are called cubic polynomials.Polynomials of the fourth degree are called fourth degree polynomials.Polynomials of the n th degree are called n th degree polynomials. Nonzero constants are polynomials of the 0th degree. Some examples of these polynomials follow: Example 4.57.  4x − 9 is a linear polynomial. Example 4.58.  3x 2 + 5x − 7 is a quadratic polynomial. Example 4.59.  8y − 2x 3 is a cubic polynomial. Example 4.60.  16a 2 − 32a 5 − 64 is a 5th degree polynomial. Example 4.61.  x 12 − y 12 is a 12th degree polynomial. Example 4.62.  7x 5 y 7 z 3 − 2x 4 y 7 z + x 3 y 7 is a 15th degree polynomial. The first term is of degree 5 + 7 + 3 = 15 . Example 4.63.  43 is a 0th degree polynomial.  || Classification of Polynomial Equations As we know, an equation is composed of two algebraic expressions separated by an equal sign. If the two expressions happen to be polynomial expressions, then we can classify the equation according to its degree. Classification of equations by degree is useful since equations of the same degree have the same type of graph. (We will study graphs of equations in Chapter 6.) The degree of an equation is the degree of the highest degree expression.  ||  || Like Terms Like Terms Terms whose variable parts, including the exponents, are identical are called like terms. Like terms is an appropriate name since terms with identical variable parts and different numerical coefficients represent different amounts of the same quantity. As long as we are dealing with quantities of the same type we can combine them using addition and subtraction. Simplifying an Algebraic Expression An algebraic expression can be simplified by combining like terms.  || Combining Like Terms Since like terms represent amounts of the same quantity, they may be combined, that is, like terms may be added together.  || Simplifying Expressions Containing Parentheses Simplifying Expressions Containing Parentheses When parentheses occur in expressions, they must be removed before the expression can be simplified. Parentheses can be removed using the distributive property. Distributive Property  ||  || Multiplying a Polynomial by a Monomial Multiplying a polynomial by a monomial is a direct application of the distributive property. Distributive Property The distributive property suggests the following rule. Multiplying a Polynomial by a Monomial To multiply a polynomial by a monomial, multiply every term of the polynomial by the monomial and then add the resulting products together.  || Simplifying + (a + b) and – (a + b) + (a + b) and – (a + b)  Oftentimes, we will encounter multiplications of the form + 1(a + b) or – 1(a + b) These terms will actually appear as + (a + b) and – (a + b) Using the distributive property, we can remove the parentheses. The parentheses have been removed and the sign of each term has remained the same. The parentheses have been removed and the sign of each term has been changed to its opposite. To remove a set of parentheses preceded by a " + " sign, simply remove the parentheses and leave the sign of each term the same. To remove a set of parentheses preceded by a “ − ” sign, remove the parentheses and change the sign of each term to its opposite sign.  || Multiplying a Polynomial by a Polynomial Since we can consider an expression enclosed within parentheses as a single quantity, we have, by the distributive property, For convenience we will use the commutative property of addition to write this expression so that the first two terms contain a and the second two contain b . (a + b)(c + d) = a c + a d + b c + b d This method is commonly called the FOIL method. FFirst terms OOuter terms IInner terms LLast terms Rearranging, Combining like terms, = 5a + 5b This use of the distributive property suggests the following rule. Multiplying a Polynomial by a Polynomial To multiply two polynomials together, multiply every term of one polynomial by every term of the other polynomial.  ||  || Expanding (a + b)2 and (a − b)2 Squaring a Binomial To square a binomial: * Square the first term. Take the product of the two terms and double it. Square the last term. Add the three results together.  || Expanding (a + b)(a − b) Sum and Difference of Two Terms To expand the sum and difference of two terms: † Square the first term and square the second term. Subtract the square of the second term from the square of the first term. ( a + b )( a − b ) = a 2 − b 2 __________ * See problems 56 and 57 at the end of this section. † See problem 58.  ||  || Independent and Dependent Variables Independent and Dependent Variables In an equation, any variable whose value can be freely assigned is said to be an independent variable. Any variable whose value is determined once the other values have been assigned is said to be a dependent variable. Two examples will help illustrate these concepts. Consider the equation y = 2x − 7 . If we are free to choose values for x , then x would be considered the independent variable. Since the value of y depends on the value of x , y would be the dependent variable. Consider the equation m = − 4g k 2 . If we are free to choose values for both g and k , then g and k would be considered independent variables. Since the value of m depends on the values chosen for g and k , m would be the dependent variable.  || The Domain of an Equation Domain The process of replacing letters with numbers is called numerical evaluation. The collection of numbers that can replace the independent variable in an equation and yield a meaningful result is called the domain of the equation. The domain of an equation may be the entire collection of real numbers or may be restricted to some subcollection of the real numbers. The restrictions may be due to particular applications of the equation or to problems of computability.  ||
