 || Multiplication/ Division Property of Equality Recall that the equal sign of an equation indicates that the number represented by the expression on the left side is the same as the number represented by the expression on the right side. From this, we can suggest the multiplication/division property of equality. Multiplication/Division Property of Equality Given any equation, We can obtain an equivalent equation by multiplying both sides of the equa­tion by the same nonzero number, that is, if , then is equivalent to We can obtain an equivalent equation by dividing both sides of the equation by the same nonzero number, that is, if , then is equivalent to The multiplication/division property of equality can be used to undo an association with a number that multiplies or divides the variable. Sample Set A Use the multiplication / division property of equality to solve each equation. Example 11.26.  6 is associated with y by multiplication. Undo the association by dividing both sides by 6 Check: When becomes , a true statement. The solution to is . Example 11.27.  . -2 is associated with by division. Undo the association by multiplying both sides by -2. Check: When , becomes a true statement. The solution to is Example 11.28.  . We will examine two methods for solving equations such as this one. Method 1: Use of dividing out common factors. 7 is associated with by division. Undo the association by multiplying both sides by 7. Divide out the 7’s. 3 is associated with by multiplication. Undo the association by dviding both sides by 3. Check: When , becomes , a true statement. The solution to is . Method 2: Use of reciprocals Recall that if the product of two numbers is 1, the numbers are reciprocals. Thus and are reciprocals. Multiply both sides of the equation by , the reciprocal of . Notice that we get the same solution using either method. Example 11.29.  -8 is associated with by multiplication. Undo the association by dividing both sides by -8. Check: When , becomes , a true statement. Example 11.30.  Since is actually and , we can isolate by multiplying both sides of the equation by . Check: When , becomes The solution to is .

(Go to Solution)  || Combining Techniques in Equation Solving Having examined solving equations using the addition/subtraction and the multi­plication/division principles of equality, we can combine these techniques to solve more complicated equations. When beginning to solve an equation such as , it is helpful to know which property of equality to use first, addition/subtraction or multiplication/di­vision. Recalling that in equation solving we are trying to isolate the variable (disas­sociate numbers from it), it is helpful to note the following. To associate numbers and letters, we use the order of operations. Multiply/divide Add/subtract To undo an association between numbers and letters, we use the order of opera­tions in reverse. Add/subtract Multiply/divide Sample Set B Solve each equation. (In these example problems, we will not show the checks.) Example 11.31.  -4 is associated with by subtraction. Undo the association by adding 4 to both sides. 6 is associated with by multiplication. Undo the association by dividing both sides by 6 Example 11.32.  3 is associated with by addition. Undo the association by subtracting 3 from both sides. -8 is associated with by multiplication. Undo the association by dividing both sides by -8. Example 11.33.  Begin by solving this equation by combining like terms. Choose a side on which to isolate m. Since 7 is greater than 1, we'll isolate m on the right side. Subtract m from both sides. 8 is associated with m by subtraction. Undo the association by adding 8 to both sides. 6 is associated with m by multiplication. Undo the association by dividing both sides by 6. Reduce. Notice that if we had chosen to isolate m on the left side of the equation rather than the right side, we would have proceeded as follows: Subtract from both sides. Add 6 to both sides, Divide both sides by -6. This is the same result as with the previous approach. Example 11.34.  7 is associated with by division. Undo the association by multiplying both sides by 7. 8 is associated with by multiplication. Undo the association by dividing both sides by 8. Practice Set B Solve each equation.
