Factoring Using the AC Method In this section, we factor trinomials of the form a x 2 + b x + c using the AC method described previously.   Example 9: Factor using the AC method: 18 x 2 − 21 x + 5 . Solution: Here a = 18, b = −21, and c = 5. Factor 90 and search for factors whose sum is −21. In this case, the sum of the factors −6 and −15 equals the middle coefficient, −21. Therefore, − 21 x = − 6 x − 15 x , and we can write Factor the equivalent expression by grouping. Answer: ( 3 x − 1 ) ( 6 x − 5 )   Example 10: Factor using the AC method: 9 x 2 − 61 x − 14 . Solution: Here a = 9, b = −61, and c = −14. We factor −126 as follows: The sum of factors 2 and −63 equals the middle coefficient, −61. Replace − 61 x with 2 x − 63 x : Answer: ( x − 7 ) ( 9 x + 2 ) . The check is left to the reader.
