Because the leading coefficient is 6, we will have to wait until Factoring ax2 + bx+ c when a != 1 on page 427 before learning how to factor this trinomial. Answer: a = −7, b = 3, c = 9 ! In this section, the leading coefficient must equal 1. Our work in this section will focus only on trinomials of the form x2 + bx+ c, that is, the form ax2 + bx+ c where a = 1. 6.3.

In this section, the leading coefficient must equal 1. Our work in this section will focus only on trinomials of the form x2 + bx+ c, that is, the form ax2 + bx+ c where a = 1.  || The ac-Method We are now going to introduce a technique called the ac-method (or ac-test) for factoring trinomials of the form ax2 + bx+ c when a = 1. In the upcoming 414 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING section Factoring ax2 + bx+ c when a != 1 on page 427, we will see that this method can also be employed when a != 1, with one minor exception. But for the remainder of this section, we focus strictly on trinomials whose leading coefficient is 1. Let’s begin by finding the following product: (x+ 12)(x− 4) = x(x− 4) + 12(x− 4) Apply the distributive property. = x2 − 4x+ 12x− 48 Distribute again. = x2 + 8x− 48 Simplify. Now, can we reverse the process? That is, can we start with x2 + 8x− 48 and place it in its original factored form (x+ 12)(x− 4) ? The answer is yes, if we apply the following procedure. The ac-method. Compare the given polynomial with the standard form ax2 + bx+ c, determine the coefficients a, b, and c, then proceed as follows: 1. Multiply the coefficients a and c and determine their product ac. List all the integer pairs whose product equals ac. 2. Circle the pair in the list produced in step 1 whose sum equals b, the coef- ficient of the middle term of ax2 + bx+ c. 3. Replace the middle term bx with a sum of like terms using the circled pair from step 2. 4. Factor by grouping. 5. Check the result using the FOIL shortcut. Let’s follow the steps of the ac-method to factor x2 + 8x− 48. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Factor: x2 + 8x− 48.Factor: x2 + 11x+ 28 Solution: Compare x2+8x−48 with ax2+bx+c and identify a = 1, b = 8, and c = −48. Note that the leading coefficient is a = 1. Calculate ac. Note that ac = (1)(−48), so ac = −48. List all integer pairs whose product is ac = −48. 1,−48 −1, 48 2,−24 −2, 24 3,−16 −3, 16 4,−12 −4, 12 6,−8 −6, 8 6.3. FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A = 1 415 Circle the ordered pair whose sum is b = 8. 1,−48 −1, 48 2,−24 −2, 24 3,−16 −3, 16 4,−12 −4, 12 6,−8 −6, 8 Replace the middle term 8x with a sum of like terms using the circled pair whose sum is 8. x2+8x− 48 = x2−4x+ 12x− 48 Factor by grouping. x2 + 8x− 48 = x(x − 4) + 12(x− 4) = (x+ 12)(x− 4) Use the FOIL shortcut to mentally check your answer. To determine the prod- uct (x+ 12)(x− 4), use these steps: • Multiply the terms in the “First” positions: x2. • Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and combine the results mentally: −4x+ 12x = 8x. • Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions: −48. That is: F O I L (x+ 12)(x− 4) = x2 − 4x + 12x − 48 Combining like terms, (x + 12)(x − 4) = x2 + 8x − 48, which is the original trinomial, so our solution checks. Note that if you combine the “Outer” and “Inner” products mentally, the check goes even faster. Answer: (x + 4)(x+ 7) ! Some readers might ask “Is it a coincidence that the circled pair −4, 12 seemed to ‘drop in place’ in the resulting factoriztion (x+12)(x− 4)?” Before we answer that question, let’s try another example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Factor: x2 − 9x− 36. Factor: x2 + 10x− 24 Solution: Compare x2−9x−36 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 1, b = −9, and c = −36. Calculate ac = (1)(−36), so ac = −36. At this point, some readers might ask “What if I start listing the ordered pairs and I see the pair I need? Do I need to continue listing the remaining pairs? 416 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING The answer is “No.” In this case, we start listing the integer pairs whose product is ac = −36, but are mindful that we need an integer pair whose sum is b = −9. The integer pair 3 and −12 has a product equaling ac = −36 and a sum equaling b = −9. 1,−36 2,−18 3,−12 Note how we ceased listing ordered pairs the moment we found the pair we needed. Next, replace the middle term −9x with a sum of like terms using the circled pair. x2−9x− 36 = x2+3x− 12x− 36 Factor by grouping. x2−9x− 36 = x(x+ 3)− 12(x+ 3) = (x− 12)(x+ 3) Use the FOIL shortcut to check your answer. F O I L (x + 3)(x− 12) = x2 − 12x + 3x − 36 Combining like terms, (x + 3)(x − 12) = x2 − 9x − 36, the original trinomial. Our solution checks.Answer: (x+ 12)(x− 2) !  || Speeding Things Up a Bit Readers might again ask “Is it a coincidence that the circled pair 3,−12 seemed to ‘drop in place’ in the resulting factoriztion (x − 12)(x + 3) ?” The answer is “No,” it is not a coincidence. Provided the leading coefficient of the trinomial ax2 + bx+ c is a = 1, you can always “drop in place” the circled pair in order to arrive at the final factorization, skipping the factoring by grouping. Some readers might also be asking “Do I really have to list any of those ordered pairs if I already recognize the pair I need?” The answer is “No!” If you see the pair you need, drop it in place. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Factor: x2 − 5x− 24.Factor: x2 − 12x+ 35 Solution: Compare x2−5x−24 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 1, b = −5, and c = −24. Calculate ac = (1)(−24), so ac = −24. Now can you think of an integer pair whose product is ac = −24 and whose sum is b = −5? For some, the required pair just pops into their head: −8 and 3. The product of these 6.3. FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A = 1 417 two integers is −24 and their sum is −5.“Drop” this pair in place and you are done. x2 − 5x− 24 = (x− 8)(x+ 3) Use the FOIL shortcut to check your answer. F O I L (x− 8)(x+ 3) = x2 + 3x − 8x − 24 Combining like terms, (x − 8)(x + 3) = x2 − 5x − 24, the original trinomial. Our solution checks. Answer: (x − 7)(x− 5) ! The “Drop in Place” technique of Example 5 allows us to revise the ac- method a bit. Revised ac-method. Compare the given polynomial with the standard form ax2 + bx + c, determine the coefficients a, b, and c, then determine a pair of integers whose product equals ac and whose sum equals b. You then have two options: 1. Write the middle term as a product of like terms using the ordered pair whose product is ac and whose sum is b. Complete the factorization process by factoring by grouping. 2. (Only works if a = 1.) Simply “drop in place” the ordered pair whose product is ac and whose sum is b to complete the factorization process. Note: We’ll see in Factoring ax2 + bx+ c when a != 1 on page 427 why this “drop in place” choice does not work when a != 1. Readers are strongly encouraged to check their factorization by determining the product using the FOIL method. If this produces the original trinomial, the factorization is correct.  || Nonlinear Equations Revisited The ability to factor trinomials of the form ax2 + bx+ c, where a = 1, increases the number of nonlinear equations we are now able to solve. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Solve the equation x2 = 2x + 3 both algebraically and Solve the equation x2 = −3x+ 4 both algebraically and graphically, then compare your answers. graphically, then compare your answers. 418 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING Solution: Because there is a power of x larger than one, the equation is nonlinear. Make one side zero. x2 = 2x+ 3 Original equation. x2 − 2x = 3 Subtract 2x from both sides. x2 − 2x− 3 = 0 Subtract 3 from both sides. Compare x2−2x−3 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 1, b = −2 and c = −3. We need an integer pair whose product is ac = −3 and whose sum is b = −2. The integer pair 1 and −3 comes to mind. “Drop” these in place to factor. (x+ 1)(x− 3) = 0 Factor. We have a product that equals zero. Use the zero product property to complete the solution. x+ 1 = 0 or x− 3 = 0 x = −1 x = 3 Thus, the solutions of x2 = 2x+ 3 are x = −1 and x = 3. Graphical solution. Load each side of the equation x2 = 2x + 3 into the Y= menu of your graphing calculator, y = x2 in Y1, y = 2x + 3 in Y2 (see Figure 6.10).

One of the intersection points is visible on the left, but the second point of intersection is very near the top of the screen at the right (see Figure 6.10). Let’s extend the top of the screen a bit. Press the WINDOW button and make adjustments to Ymin and Ymax (see Figure 6.11), then press the GRAPH button to adopt the changes. Note that both points of intersection are now visible in the viewing window (see Figure 6.11). To find the coordinates of the points of intersection, select 5:intersect from the CALC menu. Press the ENTER key to accept the “First curve,” press ENTER again to accept the “Second curve,” then press ENTER again to accept the current position of the cursor as your guess. The result is shown in the image on the left in Figure 6.12. Repeat the process to find the second point of intersection, only when it comes time to enter your “Guess,” use the right-arrow key to move the cursor closer to the second point of intersection than the first. 6.3.

Finally, note how the graphical solutions of x2 = 2x + 3, namely x = −1 and x = 3, match the solutions found using the algebraic method. This is solid evidence that both methods of solution are correct. However, it doesn’t hurt to check the final answers in the original equation, substituting −1 for x and 3 for x. x2 = 2x+ 3 and x2 = 2x+ 3 (−1)2 = 2(−1) + 3 (3)2 = 2(3) + 3 1 = −2 + 3 9 = 6 + 3 Because the last two statements are true statements, the solutions x = −1 and x = 3 check in the original equation x2 = 2x+ 3.

Solution: Because there is a power of x larger than one, the equation x2 − 4x−96 = 0 is nonlinear. We already have one side zero, so we can proceed with the factoring.

Use the zero product property to complete the solution. x+ 8 = 0 or x− 12 = 0 x = −8 x = 12 Thus, the solutions of x2 − 4x− 96 = 0 are x = −8 and x = 12. Graphical solution.

Figure 6.14: Sketch the graph of y = x2 − 4x− 96. When the degree of a polynomial is two, we’re used to seeing some sort of parabola. In Figure 6.14, we saw the graph go down and off the screen, but we did not see it turn and come back up. Let’s adjust the WINDOW parameters so that the vertex (turning point) of the parabola and both x-intercepts are visible in the viewing window. After some experimentation, the settings shown in Figure 6.15 reveal the vertex and the x-intercepts. Press the GRAPH button to produce the image at the right in Figure 6.15.

Repeat the process to find the coordinates of the second x-intercept. The result is show in the image on the right in Figure 6.16. 422 CHAPTER 6.
