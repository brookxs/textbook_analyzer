Clearing Fractions from an Equation Now that we’ve done the required fraction work, we can now concentrate on clearing fractions from an equation. Once the fractions are removed from the equation, the resulting equivalent equation is far easier to solve than the orig- inal. Clearing fractions from an equation. To clear fractions from an equation, multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator. 102 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Solve for x: x+ 2 3 = 1 2 .Solve for x: x− 3 4 = 1 2 Solution: The common denominator for 2/3 and 1/2 is 6. We begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 6. x+ 2 3 = 1 2 Original equation. 6 ( x+ 2 3 ) = 6 ( 1 2 ) Multiply both sides by 6. 6x+ 6 ( 2 3 ) = 6 ( 1 2 ) On the left, distribute the 6. To simplify 6(2/3), divide 6 by 3 to get 2, then multiply 2 by 2 to get 4. Thus, 6(2/3) = 4. Similarly, 6(1/2) = 3. 6x+ 4 = 3 Multiply: 6 ( 2 3 ) = 4, 6 ( 1 2 ) = 3. Note that the fractions are now cleared from the equation. To isolate terms containing x on one side of the equation, subtract 4 from both sides of the equation. 6x+ 4− 4 = 3− 4 Subtract 4 from both sides. 6x = −1 Simplify both sides. To “undo” multiplying by 6, divide both sides by 6. 6x 6 = −1 6 Divide both sides by 6. x = −1 6 Simplify both sides. Check: Let’s use the TI-84 to check the solution. 1.

Thus, the solution checks. Answer: x = 5/4 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Solve for x: 4 5 x = −4 3 . Solve for x: −3 7 x = 3 2 Solution: The common denominator for 4/5 and −4/3 is 15. We begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 15. 4 5 x = −4 3 Original equation. 15 ( 4 5 x ) = 15 ( −4 3 ) Multiply both sides by 15. To simplify 15(4/5), divide 5 into 15 to get 3, then multiply 3 by 4 to get 12. Thus, 15(4/5) = 12. Similarly, 15(−4/3) = −20 12x = −20 Multiply. To “undo” multiplying by 12, we divide both sides by 12. 12x 12 = −20 12 Divide both sides by 12. x = −5 3 Reduce to lowest terms. 104 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Check: To check, substitute −5/3 for x in the original equation. 4 5 x = −4 3 Original equation. 4 5 ( −5 3 ) = −4 3 Substitute −5/3 for x. −20 15 = −4 3 Multiply numerators and denominators. −4 3 = −4 3 Reduce. The fact that the last line is a true statement guarantees the −5/3 is a solution of the equation 4 5 x = −4 3 .Answer: x = −7/2 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Solve for x: 2x 3 − 3 4 = 1 2 − 3x 4 .Solve for x: 5x 9 − 2 3 = 5 9 − 3x 2 Solution: The common denominator for 2x/3, −3/4, 1/2, and −3x/4 is 12. We begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 12. 2x 3 − 3 4 = 1 2 − 3x 4 Original equation. 12 ( 2x 3 − 3 4 ) = 12 ( 1 2 − 3x 4 ) Multiply both sides by 12. 12 ( 2x 3 ) − 12 ( 3 4 ) = 12 ( 1 2 ) − 12 ( 3x 4 ) Distribute the 12 on each side. To simplify 12(2x/3), divide 3 into 12 to get 4, then multiply 4 by 2x to get 8x. Thus, 12(2x/3) = 8x. Similarly, 12(3/4) = 9, 12(1/2) = 6, and 12(3x/4) = 9x. 8x− 9 = 6− 9x Multiply. Note that the fractions are now cleared from the equation. We now need to isolate terms containing x on one side of the equation. To remove the term −9x from the right-hand side, add 9x to both sides of the equation. 8x− 9 + 9x = 6− 9x+ 9x Add 9x to both sides. 17x− 9 = 6 Simplify both sides. To remove the term −9 from the left-hand side, add 9 to both sides of the equation. 17x− 9 + 9 = 6 + 9 Add 9 to both sides. 17x = 15 Simplify both sides. 2.3.
