Power Rules for Products and Quotients Now we consider raising grouped products to a power. For example, After expanding, we have four factors of the product xy. This is equivalent to raising each of the original factors to the fourth power. In general, this describes the power rule for a product ( x y ) n = x n y n ; if a product is raised to a power, then apply that power to each factor in the product. . If n is a positive integer, then   Example 8: Simplify: ( 2 a b ) 7 . Solution: We must apply the exponent 7 to all the factors, including the coefficient, 2. If a coefficient is raised to a relatively small power, then present the real number equivalent, as we did in this example: 2 7 = 128 . Answer: 128 a 7 b 7   In many cases, the process of simplifying expressions involving exponents requires the use of several rules of exponents.   Example 9: Simplify: ( 3 x y 3 ) 4 . Solution: Answer: 81 x 4 y 12   Example 10: Simplify: ( 4 x 2 y 5 z ) 3 . Solution: Answer: 64 x 6 y 15 z 3   Example 11: Simplify: [ 5 ( x + y ) 3 ] 3 . Solution: Answer: 125 ( x + y ) 9   Next, consider a quotient raised to a power. Here we obtain four factors of the quotient, which is equivalent to the numerator and the denominator both raised to the fourth power. In general, this describes the power rule for a quotient ( x y ) n = x n y n ; if a quotient is raised to a power, then apply that power to the numerator and the denominator. . If n is a positive integer and y ≠ 0 , then In other words, given a fraction raised to a power, we can apply that exponent to the numerator and the denominator. This rule requires that the denominator is nonzero. We will make this assumption for the remainder of the section.   Example 12: Simplify: ( 3 a b ) 3 . Solution: First, apply the power rule for a quotient and then the power rule for a product. Answer: 27 a 3 b 3   In practice, we often combine these two steps by applying the exponent to all factors in the numerator and the denominator.   Example 13: Simplify: ( a b 2 2 c 3 ) 5 . Solution: Apply the exponent 5 to all of the factors in the numerator and the denominator. Answer:   a 5 b 10 32 c 15   Example 14: Simplify: ( 5 x 5 ( 2 x − 1 ) 4 3 y 7 ) 2 . Solution: Answer: 25 x 10 ( 2 x − 1 ) 8 9 y 14   It is a good practice to simplify within parentheses before using the power rules; this is consistent with the order of operations.   Example 15: Simplify: ( − 2 x 3 y 4 z x y 2 ) 4 . Solution: Answer: 16 x 8 y 8 z 4   To summarize, we have developed two new rules that are useful when grouping symbols are used in conjunction with exponents. If given a positive integer n, where y is a nonzero number, then Power rule for a product: ( x y ) n = x n y n Power rule for a quotient: ( x y ) n = x n y n   Try this! Simplify: ( 4 x 2 ( x − y ) 3 3 y z 5 ) 3 . Answer: 64 x 6 ( x − y ) 9 27 y 3 z 15 Video Solution Power Rules for Products and Quotients Now we consider raising grouped products to a power.
