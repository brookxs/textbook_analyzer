The ac-Method We are now going to introduce a technique called the ac-method (or ac-test) for factoring trinomials of the form ax2 + bx+ c when a = 1. In the upcoming 414 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING section Factoring ax2 + bx+ c when a != 1 on page 427, we will see that this method can also be employed when a != 1, with one minor exception. But for the remainder of this section, we focus strictly on trinomials whose leading coefficient is 1. Let’s begin by finding the following product: (x+ 12)(x− 4) = x(x− 4) + 12(x− 4) Apply the distributive property. = x2 − 4x+ 12x− 48 Distribute again. = x2 + 8x− 48 Simplify. Now, can we reverse the process? That is, can we start with x2 + 8x− 48 and place it in its original factored form (x+ 12)(x− 4) ? The answer is yes, if we apply the following procedure. The ac-method. Compare the given polynomial with the standard form ax2 + bx+ c, determine the coefficients a, b, and c, then proceed as follows: 1. Multiply the coefficients a and c and determine their product ac. List all the integer pairs whose product equals ac. 2. Circle the pair in the list produced in step 1 whose sum equals b, the coef- ficient of the middle term of ax2 + bx+ c. 3. Replace the middle term bx with a sum of like terms using the circled pair from step 2. 4. Factor by grouping. 5. Check the result using the FOIL shortcut. Let’s follow the steps of the ac-method to factor x2 + 8x− 48. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Factor: x2 + 8x− 48.Factor: x2 + 11x+ 28 Solution: Compare x2+8x−48 with ax2+bx+c and identify a = 1, b = 8, and c = −48. Note that the leading coefficient is a = 1. Calculate ac. Note that ac = (1)(−48), so ac = −48. List all integer pairs whose product is ac = −48. 1,−48 −1, 48 2,−24 −2, 24 3,−16 −3, 16 4,−12 −4, 12 6,−8 −6, 8 6.3. FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A = 1 415 Circle the ordered pair whose sum is b = 8. 1,−48 −1, 48 2,−24 −2, 24 3,−16 −3, 16 4,−12 −4, 12 6,−8 −6, 8 Replace the middle term 8x with a sum of like terms using the circled pair whose sum is 8. x2+8x− 48 = x2−4x+ 12x− 48 Factor by grouping. x2 + 8x− 48 = x(x − 4) + 12(x− 4) = (x+ 12)(x− 4) Use the FOIL shortcut to mentally check your answer. To determine the prod- uct (x+ 12)(x− 4), use these steps: • Multiply the terms in the “First” positions: x2. • Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and combine the results mentally: −4x+ 12x = 8x. • Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions: −48. That is: F O I L (x+ 12)(x− 4) = x2 − 4x + 12x − 48 Combining like terms, (x + 12)(x − 4) = x2 + 8x − 48, which is the original trinomial, so our solution checks. Note that if you combine the “Outer” and “Inner” products mentally, the check goes even faster. Answer: (x + 4)(x+ 7) ! Some readers might ask “Is it a coincidence that the circled pair −4, 12 seemed to ‘drop in place’ in the resulting factoriztion (x+12)(x− 4)?” Before we answer that question, let’s try another example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Factor: x2 − 9x− 36. Factor: x2 + 10x− 24 Solution: Compare x2−9x−36 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 1, b = −9, and c = −36. Calculate ac = (1)(−36), so ac = −36. At this point, some readers might ask “What if I start listing the ordered pairs and I see the pair I need? Do I need to continue listing the remaining pairs? 416 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING The answer is “No.” In this case, we start listing the integer pairs whose product is ac = −36, but are mindful that we need an integer pair whose sum is b = −9. The integer pair 3 and −12 has a product equaling ac = −36 and a sum equaling b = −9. 1,−36 2,−18 3,−12 Note how we ceased listing ordered pairs the moment we found the pair we needed. Next, replace the middle term −9x with a sum of like terms using the circled pair. x2−9x− 36 = x2+3x− 12x− 36 Factor by grouping. x2−9x− 36 = x(x+ 3)− 12(x+ 3) = (x− 12)(x+ 3) Use the FOIL shortcut to check your answer. F O I L (x + 3)(x− 12) = x2 − 12x + 3x − 36 Combining like terms, (x + 3)(x − 12) = x2 − 9x − 36, the original trinomial. Our solution checks.Answer: (x+ 12)(x− 2) !
