Calculators The calculator can be useful for finding sums and differences of decimal numbers. However, calculators with an eight-digit display cannot be used when working with decimal numbers that contain more than eight digits, or when the sum results in more than eight digits. In practice, an eight-place decimal will seldom be encoun­tered. There are some inexpensive calculators that can handle 13 decimal places. Sample Set B Use a calculator to find each sum or difference. Example 6.28.  42.0638 + 126.551 Table 6.16.     Display Reads Type 42.0638 42.0638 Press + 42.0638 Type 126.551 126.551 Press = 168.6148 The sum is 168.6148. Example 6.29.  Find the difference between 305.0627 and 14.29667. Table 6.17.     Display Reads Type 305.0627 305.0627 Press — 305.0627 Type 14.29667 14.29667 Press = 290.76603 The difference is 290.76603 Example 6.30.  51.07 + 3,891.001786 Since 3,891.001786 contains more than eight digits, we will be unable to use an eight-digit display calculator to perform this addition. We can, however, find the sum by hand. The sum is 3,942.071786. Practice Set B Use a calculator to perform each operation. Exercise 6.5.7. (Go to Solution) 4.286 + 8.97 Exercise 6.5.8. (Go to Solution) 452.0092 – 392.558 Exercise 6.5.9. (Go to Solution) Find the sum of 0.095 and 0.001862 Exercise 6.5.10. (Go to Solution) Find the difference between 0.5 and 0.025 Exercise 6.5.11. (Go to Solution) Find the sum of 2,776.00019 and 2,009.00012. Calculators The calculator can be useful for finding sums and differences of decimal numbers.
