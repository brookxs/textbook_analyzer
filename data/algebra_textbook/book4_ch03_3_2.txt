Grouping Symbols Grouping symbols are used to indicate that a particular collection of numbers and meaningful operations are to be grouped together and considered as one number. The grouping symbols commonly used in mathematics are the following: ( ), [ ], { }, ___ Parentheses: ( ) Brackets: [ ] Braces: { } Bar: ___ In a computation in which more than one operation is involved, grouping symbols indicate which operation to perform first. If possible, we perform operations inside grouping symbols first. Sample Set A If possible, determine the value of each of the following. Example 3.9.  9 + ( 3 ⋅ 8 ) Since 3 and 8 are within parentheses, they are to be combined first. Thus, 9 + ( 3 ⋅ 8 ) = 33 Example 3.10.  ( 10 ÷ 0 ) ⋅ 6 Since 10÷0 is undefined, this operation is meaningless, and we attach no value to it. We write, "undefined." Practice Set A If possible, determine the value of each of the following. Exercise 3.3.1. (Go to Solution) 16 − (3⋅2) Exercise 3.3.2. (Go to Solution) 5 + (7⋅9) Exercise 3.3.3. (Go to Solution) (4 + 8)⋅2 Exercise 3.3.4. (Go to Solution) 28÷(18 − 11) Exercise 3.3.5. (Go to Solution) (33÷3) − 11 Exercise 3.3.6. (Go to Solution) 4 + (0÷0) Grouping Symbols Grouping symbols are used to indicate that a particular collection of numbers and meaningful operations are to be grouped together and considered as one number.
