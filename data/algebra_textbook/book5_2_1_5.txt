Writing Mathematics When solving equations, observe the following rules when presenting your work. 1. One equation per line. This means that you should not arrange your work horizontally as follows: x+ 3 = 7 x+ 3− 3 = 7− 3 x = 4 That’s three equations on a line. Instead, work vertically, writing one equation per line. In the following presentation, note how we align the equal signs in a column. x+ 3 = 7 x+ 3− 3 = 7− 3 x = 4 2.1. SOLVING EQUATIONS: ONE STEP 83 2. Add and subtract inline. Do not add 7 to both sides of the equation in the following manner: x− 7 = 12 + 7 +7 x= 19 Instead, add 7 “inline” to both sides of the equation as follows: x− 7 = 12 x− 7 + 7 = 12 + 7 x = 19 84 CHAPTER 2.
