2.5 Applications The solution of a word problem must incorporate each of the following steps. Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. You must let your readers know what each variable in your problem represents. This can be accomplished in a number of ways: • Statements such as “Let P represent the perimeter of the rectangle.” • Labeling unknown values with variables in a table. • Labeling unknown quantities in a sketch or diagram. 2. Set up an Equation. Every solution to a word problem must include a carefully crafted equation that accurately describes the constraints in the problem statement. 3. Solve the Equation. You must always solve the equation set up in the previous step. 4. Answer the Question. This step is easily overlooked. For example, the problem might ask for Jane’s age, but your equation’s solution gives the age of Jane’s sister Liz. Make sure you answer the original question asked in the problem. Your solution should be written in a sentence with appropriate units. 5. Look Back. It is important to note that this step does not imply that you should simply check your solution in your equation. After all, it’s possible that your equation incorrectly models the problem’s situation, so you could have a valid solution to an incorrect equation. The important question is: “Does your answer make sense based on the words in the original problem statement.” Let’s give these requirements a test drive. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1.

Set up an Equation.“Three more than five times a certain number is −62” becomes: 122 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Three more than five times a certain number is −62 3 + 5x = −62 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for x, first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation. 3 + 5x = −62 Original equation. 3 + 5x− 3 = −62− 3 Subtract 3 from both sides. 5x = −65 Simplify. 5x 5 = −65 5 Divide both sides by 5. x = −13 Simplify. 4. Answer the Question. The unknown number is −13. 5. Look Back. Compute “three more than five times −13.” 3 + 5(−13) = 3 + (−65) = −62 Hence, three more than five times −13 is −62, as required.

Let k represent the smallest of three con- secutive integers. 2. Set up an Equation. An example of three consecutive integers is 34, 35, and 36. These are not the integers we seek, but they serve to help in the understanding of the problem. Note how each consecutive integer is one larger than the preceding integer. If k is the smallest of three consecutive integers, then the next two consecutive integers are k+1 and k+2. The “sum of three consecutive integers is −66” becomes: 2.5. APPLICATIONS 123 First consecutive integer plus second consecutive integer plus third consecutive integer is −66 k + (k + 1) + (k + 2) = −66 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for k, first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms. k + (k + 1) + (k + 2) = −66 Original equation. 3k + 3 = −66 Combine like terms. 3k + 3− 3 = −66− 3 Subtract 3 from both sides. 3k = −69 Simplify. 3k 3 = −69 3 Divide both sides by 3. k = −23 Simplify. 4. Answer the Question. The smallest of three consecutive integers is −23. 5. Look Back. If k = −23 is the smallest of three consecutive integers, then the next two consecutive integers are −22 and −21. Let’s check the sum of these three consecutive integers. −23 + (−22) + (−21) = −66 Hence, the sum of the three consecutive integers is −66, as required. Our solution is correct.

The second piece is twice as long as the first piece, and the third piece is three times as long as the first piece. Find the length of each piece cut by the carpenter. Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Let L represent the length of the first piece. Then the second piece, which is twice as long as the first piece, has length 2L. The third piece, which is three times as long as the first piece, has length 3L. Let’s construct a little table to help summarize the information provided in this problem. 124 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Piece Length (in) First piece L Second piece 2L Third piece 3L Total length 60 2. Set up an Equation. As you can see in the table above, the second column shows that the sum of the three pieces is 60 inches. In symbols: L+ 2L+ 3L = 60 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for L, first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms. L+ 2L+ 3L = 60 Original equation. 6L = 60 Combine like terms. 6L 6 = 60 6 Divide both sides by 6.

APPLICATIONS 125 Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. An example of three consecutive even integers is 18, 20, and 22. These are not the integers we seek, but they do give us some sense of the meaning of three consecutive even integers. Note that each consecutive even integer is two larger than the preceding integer. Thus, if k is the length of the first side of the triangle, then the next two sides are k+2 and k+4. In this example, our variable dictionary will take the form of a well-labeled figure. k + 2 kk + 4 2. Set up an Equation. The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the three sides. If the perimeter is 156 centimeters, then: k + (k + 2) + (k + 4) = 156 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for k, first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms. k + (k + 2) + (k + 4) = 156 Original equation. 3k + 6 = 156 Combine like terms. 3k + 6− 6 = 156− 6 Subtract 6 from both sides. 3k = 150 Simplify. 3k 3 = 150 3 Divide both sides by 3. k = 50 Simplify. 4. Answer the Question. Thus, the first side has length 50 centimeters. Because the next two consecutive even integers are k+2 = 52 and k+4 = 54, the three sides of the triangle measure 50, 52, and 54 centimeters, respectively. 5. Look Back. An image helps our understanding. The three sides are consecutive even integers. 126 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES 52 cm 50 cm54 cm Note that the perimeter (sum of the three sides) is: 50 cm + 52 cm+ 54 cm = 156 cm (2.1) Thus, the perimeter is 156 centimeters, as it should be.

A well-known fact from geometry is the fact that the sumThe second angle of a triangle is three times bigger than the first angle. The third angle of the triangle is a 40 degrees larger than the second angle. How many degrees are in each angle? of the angles of a triangle is 180◦. Suppose we have a triangle whose second angle is 10 degrees larger than twice its first angle and whose third angle is 50 degrees larger than its first angle. Find the measure of each angle of the triangle. Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. The Greek alphabet starts out with the letters α, β, γ, δ, (, . . . , in much the same way that the English alphabet start out with the letters a, b, c, d, e, . . . . Mathematicians love to use Greek letters, especially in the study of trigonometry. The greek letter θ (pronounced “theta”) is particularly favored in representing an angle of a triangle. So, we’ll let θ represent the degree measure of the first angle of the triangle. The second angle is 10 degrees larger than twice the first angle, so the second angle is 2θ+10. The third angle is 50 degrees larger than the first angle, so the third angle is θ + 50. Again, we’ll set up a well-labeled figure for our variable dictionary. θ + 50θ 2θ + 10 2.5. APPLICATIONS 127 2. Set up an Equation. The sum of the angles is 180◦, so: θ + (2θ + 10) + (θ + 50) = 180 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for θ, first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms. θ + (2θ + 10) + (θ + 50) = 180 Original equation. 4θ + 60 = 180 Combine like terms. 4θ + 60− 60 = 180− 60 Subtract 60 from both sides. 4θ = 120 Simplify. 4θ 4 = 120 4 Divide both sides by 4. θ = 30 Simplify. 4. Answer the Question. Thus, the first angle is θ = 30 degrees, the second angle is 2θ+10 = 70 degrees, and the third angle is θ +50 = 80 degrees. 5. Look Back. An image helps our understanding. Note that the second angle is 10 degrees larger than twice the first angle. Note that the third angle is 50 degrees larger than the first angle. 80◦30◦ 70◦ Note that the sum of the angles is: 30◦ + 70◦ + 80◦ = 180◦ (2.2) Thus, the sum of the three angles is 180 degrees, as it should be.

He invests part in a fund that pays 5% per year and the rest in a fund that pays 4% per year. At the end of one year, the combined interest from both investments was $4,250. How much did he invest in each fund? in three separate accounts. The amount she invests in the second account is twice the amount she invests in the first account. The amount she invests in 128 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES the third account is $1,000 more than the amount she invests in the second account. How much did she invest in each account? Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. We’ll use a table in this example to help set up our variable dictionary. Let x be the amount invested in the first account. The amount invested in the second account is twice that invested in the first account, so 2x is the amount invested in the second account. The third account investment is $1,000 more than the amount invested in the second account, so that is 2x+ 1000. Account # Amount Invested Account#1 x Account#2 2x Account#3 2x+ 1000 Total Invested 21000 2. Set up an Equation. The second column of the table reveals the required equation. The three investments must sum to $21,000. x+ 2x+ (2x+ 1000) = 21000 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for x, first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms. x+ 2x+ (2x+ 1000) = 21000 Original equation. 5x+ 1000 = 21000 Combine like terms. 5x+ 1000− 1000 = 21000− 1000 Subtract 1000 from both sides. 5x = 20000 Simplify. 5x 5 = 20000 5 Divide both sides by 5. x = 4000 Simplify. 4. Answer the Question. Substitute x = 4000 in each entry of the second column of the table above to produce the results in the table below. Account # Amount Invested Amount Invested Account#1 x $4,000 Account#2 2x $8,000 Account#3 2x+ 1000 $9,000 Total Invested 21000 $21,000 2.5. APPLICATIONS 129 5. Look Back. As we can see in our answer table, the amount $8,000 invested in the second account is twice the amount invested in the first account. The amount $9,000 invested in the third account is %1,000 more than the amount invested in the second account. Moreover, the total investment is: $4, 000 + $8, 000 + $9, 000 = $21, 000 (2.3) Thus, the total investment is $21,000, as it should be. We have the correct solution.

If Magaret is four times as far from the start of the ride as she is from the finish, how many more miles does she have to go before she finishes her ride? to Canada. Shortly before he crosses over from Oregon into Washington he is four times as far from the beginning of the trail as he is from the end. How much further does he have to hike? Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Let d represent the distance left for Jeff to hike. Because Jeff is four times further from the beginning of the trail than the end, the distance Jeff already completed is 4d. Let’s construct a little table to help summarize the information provided in this problem. Section of Trail Distance (mi) Distance to finish d Distance from start 4d Total distance 2650 2. Set up an Equation. As you can see in the table above, the second column shows that the sum of the two distances is 2650 miles. In symbols: d+ 4d = 2650 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for d, first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms. d+ 4d = 2650 Original equation. 5d = 2650 Combine like terms. 5d 5 = 2650 5 Divide both sides by 5. d = 530 Simplify. 130 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES 4. Answer the Question. Jeff still has 530 miles to hike. 5. Look Back. Because the amount left to hike is d = 530 miles, Jeff’s distance from the start of the trail is 4d = 4(530), or 2,120 miles. If we arrange these results in tabular form, it is evident that not only is the distance from the start of the trail four times that of the distance left to the finish, but also the sum of their lengths is equal to the total length of the trail. Section of Trail Distance (mi) Distance (mi) Distance to finish d 530 Distance from start 4d 2120 Total distance 2650 2650 Thus, we have the correct solution.Answer: 20 miles ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8.

If only 36 students are present, what is the actual size of Mary’s class? stayed home from school. If only 34 students are present, what is the actual size of Sister Damaris’ class? Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Let S represent the actual size of Sister Damaris’ class. 2. Set up an Equation. If 15% of Sister Damaris’ class was absent, then 85% of her class was present. There are 34 student present, so the phrase “85% of Sister Damaris’ class is 34” translates into the equation, 0.85S = 34, where we’ve changed 85% to a decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the left. 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for S, first clear the decimals by multiplying both sides of the equation by 100. 0.85S = 34 Original equation. 85S = 3400 Multiply both sides by 100. 85S 85 = 3400 85 Divide both sides by 85. S = 40 Simplify. 2.5. APPLICATIONS 131 4. Answer the Question. Sister Damaris’ class size is 40. 5. Look Back. We’re told that 15% of Sister Damaris’ class is absent. If we calculate 15% of 40, we get: 0.15(40) = 6 Thus, there were 6 students absent, so 40−6, or 34 students were present. Thus, we have the correct solution. Answer: 45 ! 132 CHAPTER 2.

How much did she invest in each account? Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. We’ll use a table in this example to help set up our variable dictionary. Let x be the amount invested in the first account. The amount invested in the second account is twice that invested in the first account, so 2x is the amount invested in the second account. The third account investment is $1,000 more than the amount invested in the second account, so that is 2x+ 1000. Account # Amount Invested Account#1 x Account#2 2x Account#3 2x+ 1000 Total Invested 21000 2. Set up an Equation. The second column of the table reveals the required equation. The three investments must sum to $21,000. x+ 2x+ (2x+ 1000) = 21000 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for x, first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms. x+ 2x+ (2x+ 1000) = 21000 Original equation. 5x+ 1000 = 21000 Combine like terms. 5x+ 1000− 1000 = 21000− 1000 Subtract 1000 from both sides. 5x = 20000 Simplify. 5x 5 = 20000 5 Divide both sides by 5. x = 4000 Simplify. 4. Answer the Question. Substitute x = 4000 in each entry of the second column of the table above to produce the results in the table below. Account # Amount Invested Amount Invested Account#1 x $4,000 Account#2 2x $8,000 Account#3 2x+ 1000 $9,000 Total Invested 21000 $21,000 2.5. APPLICATIONS 129 5. Look Back. As we can see in our answer table, the amount $8,000 invested in the second account is twice the amount invested in the first account. The amount $9,000 invested in the third account is %1,000 more than the amount invested in the second account. Moreover, the total investment is: $4, 000 + $8, 000 + $9, 000 = $21, 000 (2.3) Thus, the total investment is $21,000, as it should be. We have the correct solution. Answer: $5,000 at 5% and $10,000 at 4%. ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Jeff is hiking the 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail from Mexico Margaret is cycling along a lane that measures 100 miles. If Magaret is four times as far from the start of the ride as she is from the finish, how many more miles does she have to go before she finishes her ride? to Canada. Shortly before he crosses over from Oregon into Washington he is four times as far from the beginning of the trail as he is from the end. How much further does he have to hike? Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Let d represent the distance left for Jeff to hike. Because Jeff is four times further from the beginning of the trail than the end, the distance Jeff already completed is 4d. Let’s construct a little table to help summarize the information provided in this problem. Section of Trail Distance (mi) Distance to finish d Distance from start 4d Total distance 2650 2. Set up an Equation. As you can see in the table above, the second column shows that the sum of the two distances is 2650 miles. In symbols: d+ 4d = 2650 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for d, first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms. d+ 4d = 2650 Original equation. 5d = 2650 Combine like terms. 5d 5 = 2650 5 Divide both sides by 5. d = 530 Simplify. 130 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES 4. Answer the Question. Jeff still has 530 miles to hike. 5. Look Back. Because the amount left to hike is d = 530 miles, Jeff’s distance from the start of the trail is 4d = 4(530), or 2,120 miles. If we arrange these results in tabular form, it is evident that not only is the distance from the start of the trail four times that of the distance left to the finish, but also the sum of their lengths is equal to the total length of the trail. Section of Trail Distance (mi) Distance (mi) Distance to finish d 530 Distance from start 4d 2120 Total distance 2650 2650 Thus, we have the correct solution.Answer: 20 miles ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Today 15% of Sister Damaris’ seventh grade class were ill and20% of Mary’s class were ill and stayed home from school. If only 36 students are present, what is the actual size of Mary’s class? stayed home from school. If only 34 students are present, what is the actual size of Sister Damaris’ class? Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Let S represent the actual size of Sister Damaris’ class. 2. Set up an Equation. If 15% of Sister Damaris’ class was absent, then 85% of her class was present. There are 34 student present, so the phrase “85% of Sister Damaris’ class is 34” translates into the equation, 0.85S = 34, where we’ve changed 85% to a decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the left. 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for S, first clear the decimals by multiplying both sides of the equation by 100. 0.85S = 34 Original equation. 85S = 3400 Multiply both sides by 100. 85S 85 = 3400 85 Divide both sides by 85. S = 40 Simplify. 2.5. APPLICATIONS 131 4. Answer the Question. Sister Damaris’ class size is 40. 5. Look Back. We’re told that 15% of Sister Damaris’ class is absent. If we calculate 15% of 40, we get: 0.15(40) = 6 Thus, there were 6 students absent, so 40−6, or 34 students were present. Thus, we have the correct solution. Answer: 45 ! 132 CHAPTER 2.
