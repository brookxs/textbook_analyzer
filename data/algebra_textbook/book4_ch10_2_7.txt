Ordering Real Numbers Ordering Real Numbers A real number b is said to be greater than a real number a , denoted b > a , if b is to the right of a on the number line. Thus, as we would expect, 5 > 2 since 5 is to the right of 2 on the number line. Also, – 2 > – 5 since -2 is to the right of -5 on the number line. If we let a and b represent two numbers, then a and b are related in exactly one of three ways: Either Equality Symbol Inequality Symbols Sample Set B Example 10.4.  What integers can replace x so that the following statement is true? – 3 ≤ x < 2 The integers are -3, -2, -1, 0, 1. Example 10.5.  Draw a number line that extends from -3 to 5. Place points at all whole numbers between and including -1 and 3. -1 is not a whole number Practice Set B Exercise 10.2.6. (Go to Solution) What integers can replace x so that the following statement is true? – 5 ≤ x < 2 Exercise 10.2.7. (Go to Solution) Draw a number line that extends from -4 to 3. Place points at all natural numbers between, but not including, -2 to 2.
