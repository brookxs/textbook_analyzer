Linear Inequalities Linear Inequality A linear inequality is a mathematical statement that one linear expression is greater than or less than another linear expression. Inequality Notation The following notation is used to express relationships of inequality: Note that the expression x > 12 has infinitely many solutions. Any number strictly greater than 12 will satisfy the statement. Some solutions are 13, 15, 90, 12.1, 16.3 and 102.51 .
