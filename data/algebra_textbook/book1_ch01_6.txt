 || Multiplication of Fractions Multiplication of Fractions To multiply two fractions, multiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together. Reduce to lowest terms if possible. Example 1.24.  For example, multiply Notice that we since had to reduce, we nearly started over again with the original two fractions. If we factor first, then cancel, then multiply, we will save time and energy and still obtain the correct product.  || Division of Fractions Reciprocals Two numbers whose product is 1 are reciprocals of each other. For example, since and are reciprocals of each other. Some other pairs of reciprocals are listed below.Reciprocals are used in division of fractions. Division of Fractions To divide a first fraction by a second fraction, multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. Reduce if possible. This method is sometimes called the “invert and multiply” method.  || Addition and Subtraction of Fractions Fractions with Like Denominators To add (or subtract) two or more fractions that have the same denominators, add (or subtract) the numerators and place the resulting sum over the common denominator. Reduce if possible. CAUTIONAdd or subtract only the numerators. Do not add or subtract the denominators!  ||
