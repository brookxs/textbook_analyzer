 || The Commutative Property of Addition Commutative Property of Addition If two whole numbers are added in any order, the sum will not change. Sample Set A Example 1.48.  Add the whole numbers 8 + 5 = 13 5 + 8 = 13 The numbers 8 and 5 can be added in any order. Regardless of the order they are added, the sum is 13. Practice Set A Exercise 1.7.1. (Go to Solution) Use the commutative property of addition to find the sum of 12 and 41 in two different ways. Exercise 1.7.2. (Go to Solution) Add the whole numbers  || The Associative Property of Addition Associative Property of Addition If three whole numbers are to be added, the sum will be the same if the first two are added first, then that sum is added to the third, or, the second two are added first, and that sum is added to the first. Using Parentheses It is a common mathematical practice to use parentheses to show which pair of numbers we wish to combine first. Sample Set B Example 1.49.  Add the whole numbers. Practice Set B Exercise 1.7.3. (Go to Solution) Use the associative property of addition to add the following whole numbers two different ways. Exercise 1.7.4. (Go to Solution)  || The Additive Identity 0 Is the Additive Identity The whole number 0 is called the additive identity, since when it is added to any whole number, the sum is identical to that whole number. Sample Set C Example 1.50.  Add the whole numbers. 29 + 0 = 29 0 + 29 = 29 Zero added to 29 does not change the identity of 29. Practice Set C Add the following whole numbers. Exercise 1.7.5. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.7.6. (Go to Solution) Suppose we let the letter x represent a choice for some whole number. For the first two problems, find the sums. For the third problem, find the sum provided we now know that x represents the whole number 17. Exercise 1.7.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.7.8. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.7.9. (Go to Solution)  ||
