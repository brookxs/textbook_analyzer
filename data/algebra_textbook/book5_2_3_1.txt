Canceling is More Efficient In Examples 1, 2, and 3, we multiplied numerators, then divided by the sole denominator. We also saw that it is a bit difficult to carry the work in our head as the numbers grow larger. In Chapter 1, Section 3, we saw that canceling reduces the size of the numbers and simplifies the work. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify: 72 ( 8 9 x ) . Simplify: 64 ( 5 8 x ) Solution: In Example 3, we used our calculator to multiply 72 and 8 to get 576, then divided 576 by 9 to get 64. In this solution, we divide 9 into 72 to get 8, then multiply 8 by 8 to get 64. We get the same answer, but because the intermediate numbers are much smaller, the calculations are much easier to do mentally. 2.3. CLEARING FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 101 72 ( 8 9 x ) = ( 72 · 8 9 ) x Associative property of multiplication. = (8 · 8)x Divide: 72/9 = 8. = 64x Multiply: 8 · 8 = 64. Answer: 40x ! Example 4 shows all of the steps involved in arriving at the answer. Again, the goal in this section is to perform this calculation mentally, so we just “Divide 9 into 72 to get 8, then multiply 8 by 8 to get 644.” 72 ( 8 9 x ) = 64x Not only does this approach allow us to write down the answer without doing any work, the numerical calculations involve smaller numbers. You should practice this mental calculation until you can write down the answer without writing down any steps. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify: 27 ( 5 9 x ) . Simplify: 18 ( 3 2 x )Solution: Divide 9 into 27 to get 3, then multiply 3 by 5 to get 15. 27 ( 5 9 x ) = 15x Answer: 27x ! Note: The technique shown in Examples 4 and 5 is the technique we’ll use in the remainder of this section. Dividing (canceling) first is far more efficient, the smaller numbers allowing us to perform the calculation mentally.
