 || Converting to Multiple Units Denominate Numbers Numbers that have units of measure associated with them are called denominate numbers. It is often convenient, or even necessary, to simplify a denominate number. Simplified Denominate Number A denominate number is simplified when the number of standard units of measure associated With it does not exceed the next higher type of unit. The denominate number 55 min is simplified since it is smaller than the next higher type of unit, 1 hr. The denominate number 65 min is not simplified since it is not smaller than the next higher type of unit, 1 hr. The denominate number 65 min can be simplified to 1 hr 5 min. The denominate number 1 hr 5 min is simplified since the next higher type of unit is day, and 1 hr does not exceed 1 day. Sample Set A Example 9.8.  Simplify 19 in. Since 12  in. = 1 ft, and 19 = 12 + 7, Example 9.9.  Simplify 4 gal 5 qt. Since 4  qt = 1 gal, and 5 = 4 + 1, Example 9.10.  Simplify 2 hr 75 min. Since 60 min = 1 hr, and 75 = 60 + 15, Example 9.11.  Simplify 43 fl oz. Since 8 fl oz = 1 c (1 cup), and 43÷8 = 5 R3, But, 2 c = 1 pt and 5÷2 = 2 R1. So, But, 2 pt = 1 qt, so 2 pt + 1 c + 3 fl oz = 1 qt 1 c 3 fl oz Practice Set A Simplify each denominate number. Refer to the conversion tables given in Section 9.2, if necessary. Exercise 9.4.1. (Go to Solution) 18 in. Exercise 9.4.2. (Go to Solution) 8 gal 9 qt Exercise 9.4.3. (Go to Solution) 5 hr 80 min Exercise 9.4.4. (Go to Solution) 8 wk 11 da Exercise 9.4.5. (Go to Solution) 86 da  || Adding and Subtracting Denominate Numbers Adding and Subtracting Denominate Numbers Denominate numbers can be added or subtracted by: writing the numbers vertically so that the like units appear in the same column. adding or subtracting the number parts, carrying along the unit. simplifying the sum or difference. Sample Set B Example 9.12.  Add 6 ft 8 in. to 2 ft 9 in. Since 12 in. = 1 ft, Example 9.13.  Subtract 5 da 3 hr from 8 da 11 hr. Example 9.14.  Subtract 3 lb 14 oz from 5 lb 3 oz. We cannot directly subtract 14 oz from 3 oz, so we must borrow 16 oz from the pounds. Example 9.15.  Subtract 4 da 9 hr 21 min from 7 da 10 min. Borrow 1 da from the 7 da. Borrow 1 hr from the 24 hr. Practice Set B Perform each operation. Simplify when possible. Exercise 9.4.6. (Go to Solution) Add 4 gal 3 qt to 1 gal 2 qt. Exercise 9.4.7. (Go to Solution) Add 9 hr 48 min to 4 hr 26 min. Exercise 9.4.8. (Go to Solution) Subtract 2 ft 5 in. from 8 ft 7 in. Exercise 9.4.9. (Go to Solution) Subtract 15 km 460 m from 27 km 800 m. Exercise 9.4.10. (Go to Solution) Subtract 8 min 35 sec from 12 min 10 sec. Exercise 9.4.11. (Go to Solution) Add 4 yd 2 ft 7 in. to 9 yd 2 ft 8 in. Exercise 9.4.12. (Go to Solution) Subtract 11 min 55 sec from 25 min 8 sec.  || Multiplying a Denominate Number by a Whole Number Let's examine the repeated sum Recalling that multiplication is a description of repeated addition, by the distribu­tive property we have From these observations, we can suggest the following rule. Multiplying a Denominate Number by a Whole Number To multiply a denominate number by a whole number, multiply the number part of each unit by the whole number and affix the unit to this product. Sample Set C Perform the following multiplications. Simplify if necessary. Example 9.16.  Since 3 ft = 1 yd and 12  in. = 1 ft, Example 9.17.  Practice Set C Perform the following multiplications. Simplify. Exercise 9.4.13. (Go to Solution) 2⋅(10 min) Exercise 9.4.14. (Go to Solution) 5⋅(3 qt) Exercise 9.4.15. (Go to Solution) 4⋅(5 ft 8 in.) Exercise 9.4.16. (Go to Solution) 10⋅(2 hr 15 min 40 sec)  || Dividing a Denominate Number by a Whole Number Dividing a Denominate Number by a Whole Number To divide a denominate number by a whole number, divide the number part of each unit by the whole number beginning with the largest unit. Affix the unit to this quotient. Carry any remainder to the next unit. Sample Set D Perform the following divisions. Simplify if necessary. Example 9.18.  (12 min 40 sec)÷4 Thus (12 min 40 sec)÷4 = 3 min 10 sec Example 9.19.  (5 yd 2 ft 9 in.)÷3 Thus (5 yd 2 ft 9 in.)÷3 = 1 yd 2 ft 11 in. Practice Set D Perform the following divisions. Simplify if necessary. Exercise 9.4.17. (Go to Solution) (18 hr 36 min)÷9 Exercise 9.4.18. (Go to Solution) (34 hr 8 min.)÷8 Exercise 9.4.19. (Go to Solution) (13 yd 7 in.)÷5 Exercise 9.4.20.
