 || Square Root Equations And Extraneous Solutions Square Root Equation A square root equation is an equation that contains a variable under a square root sign. The fact that suggests that we can solve a square root equation by squaring both sides of the equation. Extraneous Solutions Squaring both sides of an equation can, however, introduce extraneous solutions. Consider the equation x = − 6 The solution is − 6. Square both sides. x 2 = ( − 6 ) 2 x 2 = 36 This equation has two solutions, − 6 and + 6. The + 6 is an extraneous solution since it does not check in the original equation: + 6 ≠ − 6.  || Method For Solving Square Root Equations Solving Square Root Equations Isolate a radical. This means get a square root expression by itself on one side of the equal sign. Square both sides of the equation. Simplify the equation by combining like terms. Repeat step 1 if radicals are still present. Obtain potential solutions by solving the resulting non-square root equation. Check each potential solution by substitution into the original equation.  ||
