Multiplication and Division of Decimals The sign rules for decimal multiplication and division are the same as the sign rules used for integers and fractions. Sign Rules for multiplication and division. When multiplying or dividing two decimal numbers, use the following rules: • Like signs give a positive result. • Unlike signs give a negative result. Multiplication of decimal numbers is fairly straightforward. First multiply the magnitudes of the numbers, ignoring the decimal points, then count the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in each factor. Place the decimal point in the product so that the number of digits to the right of the decimal points equals the sum of number of digits to the right of the decimal point in each factor. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify: (−1.96)(2.8) Simplify: (−12.5)(−23.4) Solution: Multiply the magnitudes. The first decimal number has two digits to the right of the decimal point, the second has one digit to the right of the decimal point. Thus, we must place a total of three digits to the right of the decimal point in the product. (−1.96)(2.8) = −5.488 1.96 ×2.8 1 568 3 92 5.488 Note that unlike signs yield a negative product. Answer: 292.50 ! When dividing signed decimal numbers, ignore the signs and divide the magnitudes. Push the decimal point in the divisor to the end of the divisor, then move the decimal point in the dividend an equal number of spaces. This sets the decimal point in the quotient. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Simplify: −4.392÷ (−0.36) Simplify: −5.76/3.2 Solution. Divide the magnitudes. Move the decimal in the divisor to the end of the divisor. Move the decimal in the dividend an equal number of places (two places) to the right. 52 CHAPTER 1.
