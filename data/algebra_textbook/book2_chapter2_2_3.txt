Distributive Property and Like Terms When simplifying, we will often have to combine like terms after we apply the distributive property. This step is consistent with the order of operations: multiplication before addition.   Example 11: Simplify: 2 ( 3 a − b ) − 7 ( − 2 a + 3 b ) . Solution: Distribute 2 and −7 and then combine like terms. Answer: 20 a − 23 b   In the example above, it is important to point out that you can remove the parentheses and collect like terms because you multiply the second quantity by −7, not just by 7. To correctly apply the distributive property, think of this as adding −7 times the given quantity, 2 ( 3 a − b ) + ( − 7 ) ( − 2 a + 3 b ) .   Try this! Simplify: − 5 ( 2 x − 3 ) + 7 x . Answer: − 3 x + 15 Video Solution Often we will encounter algebraic expressions like + ( a + b ) or − ( a + b ) . As we have seen, the coefficients are actually implied to be +1 and −1, respectively, and therefore, the distributive property applies using +1 or –1 as the factor. Multiply each term within the parentheses by these factors: This leads to two useful properties,   Example 12: Simplify: 5 x − ( − 2 x 2 + 3 x − 1 ) . Solution: Multiply each term within the parentheses by −1 and then combine like terms. Answer: 2 x 2 + 2 x + 1   When distributing a negative number, all of the signs within the parentheses will change. Note that 5 x in the example above is a separate term; hence the distributive property does not apply to it.   Example 13: Simplify: 5 − 2 ( x 2 − 4 x − 3 ) . Solution: The order of operations requires that we multiply before subtracting. Therefore, distribute −2 and then combine the constant terms. Subtracting 5 − 2 first leads to an incorrect result, as illustrated below: Answer: −2x2 + 8x + 11 Caution It is worth repeating that you must follow the order of operations: multiply and divide before adding and subtracting! Try this! Simplify: 8 − 3 ( − x 2 + 2 x − 7 ) . Answer: 3 x 2 − 6 x + 29 Video Solution   Example 14: Subtract 3 x − 2 from twice the quantity − 4 x 2 + 2 x − 8 . Solution: First, group each expression and treat each as a quantity: Next, identify the key words and translate them into a mathematical expression. Finally, simplify the resulting expression. Answer: − 8 x 2 + x − 14 Distributive Property and Like Terms When simplifying, we will often have to combine like terms after we apply the distributive property.
