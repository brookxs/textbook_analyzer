Conversions in the United States System It is often convenient or necessary to convert from one unit of measure to another. For example, it may be convenient to convert a measurement of length that is given in feet to one that is given in inches. Such conversions can be made using unit fractions. Unit Fraction A unit fraction is a fraction with a value of 1. Unit fractions are formed by using two equal measurements. One measurement is placed in the numerator of the fraction, and the other in the denominator. Place­ment depends on the desired conversion. Placement of Units Place the unit being converted to in the numerator. Place the unit being converted from in the denominator. For example, Table 9.2. Equal Measurements Unit Fraction 1ft = 12in. 1pt = 16 fl oz 1wk = 7da Sample Set A Make the following conversions. If a fraction occurs, convert it to a decimal rounded to two decimal places. Example 9.1.  Convert 11 yards to feet. Looking in the unit conversion table under length, we see that 1 yd = 3 ft. There are two corresponding unit fractions, and . Which one should we use? Look to see which unit we wish to convert to. Choose the unit fraction with this unit in the numerator. We will choose since this unit fraction has feet in the numerator. Now, multiply 11 yd by the unit fraction. Notice that since the unit fraction has the value of 1, multiplying by it does not change the value of 11 yd. Thus, 11 yd = 33ft. Example 9.2.  Convert 36 fl oz to pints. Looking in the unit conversion table under liquid volume, we see that 1 pt = 16 fl oz. Since we are to convert to pints, we will construct a unit fraction with pints in the numerator. Thus, 36 fl oz = 2.25 pt. Example 9.3.  Convert 2,016 hr to weeks. Looking in the unit conversion table under time, we see that 1wk = 7da and that 1 da = 24 hr. To convert from hours to weeks, we must first convert from hours to days and then from days to weeks. We need two unit fractions. The unit fraction needed for converting from hours to days is . The unit fraction needed for converting from days to weeks is . Thus, 2,016 hr = 12 wk. Practice Set A Make the following conversions. If a fraction occurs, convert it to a decimal rounded to two decimal places. Exercise 9.2.1. (Go to Solution) Convert 18 ft to yards. Exercise 9.2.2. (Go to Solution) Convert 2 mi to feet. Exercise 9.2.3. (Go to Solution) Convert 26 ft to yards. Exercise 9.2.4. (Go to Solution) Convert 9 qt to pints. Exercise 9.2.5. (Go to Solution) Convert 52 min to hours. Exercise 9.2.6. (Go to Solution) Convert 412 hr to weeks.
