Multiplying Fractions First, the definition. Multiplication of Fractions. If a/b and c/d are two fractions, then their product is defined as follows: a b · c d = ac bd Thus, to find the product of a/b and c/d, simply multiply numerators and multiply denominators. For example: 1 2 · 3 4 = 3 8 and − 2 5 · 7 3 = −14 15 and − 5 8 · ( −1 6 ) = 5 48 Like integer multiplication, like signs yield a positive answer, unlike signs yield a negative answer. Of course, when necessary, remember to reduce your answer to lowest terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify: −14 20 · 10 21 Simplify: − 8 9 · ( −27 20 ) 34 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Solution: Multiply numerators and denominators, then reduce to lowest terms. −14 20 · 10 21 = −140 420 Multiply numerators and denominators. = − 2 · 2 · 5 · 7 2 · 2 · 3 · 5 · 7 Prime factor. = − !2 · !2 · !5 · !7 !2 · !2 · 3 · !5 · !7 Cancel common factors. = −1 3 Simplify. Note that when all the factors cancel from the numerator, you are left with a 1. Thus, (−14/20) · (10/21) = −1/3.Answer: 6/5 ! Cancellation Rule. When multiplying fractions, cancel common factors ac- cording to the following rule: “Cancel a factor in a numerator for an identical factor in a denominator.” The rule is “cancel something on the top for something on the bottom.” Thus, an alternate approach to multiplying fractions is to factor numerators and denominators in place, then cancel a factor in a numerator for an identical factor in a denominator. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify: 15 8 · ( −14 9 ) Simplify: − 6 45 · ( −35 14 ) Solution: Factor numerators and denominators in place, then cancel common factors in the numerators for common factors in the denominators. 15 8 · ( −14 9 ) = 3 · 5 2 · 2 · 2 · ( −2 · 7 3 · 3 ) Factor numerators and denominators. = ! 3 · 5 !2 · 2 · 2 · ( −!2 · 7 !3 · 3 ) Cancel a factor in a numerator for a common. factor in a denominator. = −35 12 Multiply numerators and. denominators. Note that unlike signs yield a negative product. Thus, (15/8) · (−14/9) = −35/12.Answer: 1/3 ! 1.3. THE RATIONAL NUMBERS 35 Multiplying Fractions First, the definition. Multiplication of Fractions.
