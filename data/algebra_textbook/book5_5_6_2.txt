Multiplying a Monomial and a Polynomial Now we turn our attention to the product of a monomial and a polynomial. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Multiply: 5(3x2 − 4x− 8) Multiply: 4(−2y2 + 3y + 5) Solution: We need to first distribute the 5 times each term of the polynomial. Then we multiply the resulting monomials mentally. 5(3x2 − 4x− 8) = 5(3x2)− 5(4x)− 5(8) = 15x2 − 20x− 40 Answer: −8y2 + 12y + 20 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Multiply: 2y(−3y + 5) Multiply: −3x(4− 2x) Solution: We need to first distribute the 2y times each term of the polynomial. Then we multiply the resulting monomials mentally. 2y(−3y + 5) = 2y(−3y) + 2y(5) = −6y2 + 10y Answer: −12x+ 6x2 ! 358 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Multiply: −3ab(a2 + 2ab− b2)Multiply: 2xy(x2 − 4xy2 + 7x) Solution: We need to first distribute the −3ab times each term of the poly- nomial. Then we multiply the resulting monomials mentally. −3ab(a2 + 2ab− b2) = −3ab(a2) + (−3ab)(2ab)− (−3ab)(b2) = −3a3b+ (−6a2b2)− (−3ab3) = −3a3b− 6a2b2 + 3ab3 Alternate solution: It is far more efficient to perform most of the steps of the product −3ab(a2 + 2ab − b2) mentally. We know we must multiply −3ab times each of the terms of the polynomial a2 + 2ab− b2. Here are our mental calculations: i) −3ab times a2 equals −3a3b. ii) −3ab times 2ab equals −6a2b2. iii) −3ab times −b2 equals 3ab3. Thinking in this manner allows us to write down the answer without any of the steps shown in our first solution. That is, we immediately write: −3ab(a2 + 2ab− b2) = −3a3b− 6a2b2 + 3ab3 Answer: 2x3y − 8x2y3 + 14x2y ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Multiply: −2z2(z3 + 4z2 − 11)Multiply: −5y3(y2 − 2y + 1) Solution: We need to first distribute the −2z2 times each term of the poly- nomial. Then we multiply the resulting monomials mentally. −2z2(z3 + 4z2 − 11) = −2z2(z3) + (−2z2)(4z2)− (−2z2)(11) = −2z5 + (−8z4)− (−22z2) = −2z5 − 8z4 + 22z2 Alternate solution: It is far more efficient to perform most of the steps of the product −2z2(z3 + 4z2 − 11) mentally. We know we must multiply −2z2 times each of the terms of the polynomial z3 + 4z2 − 11. Here are our mental calculations: 5.6.
