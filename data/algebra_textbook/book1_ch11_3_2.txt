When Substitution Works Best We know how to solve a linear equation in one variable. We shall now study a method for solving a system of two linear equations in two variables by transforming the two equations in two variables into one equation in one variable.To make this transformation, we need to eliminate one equation and one variable. We can make this elimination by substitution. When Substitution Works Best The substitution method works best when either of these conditions exists: One of the variables has a coefficient of 1,  or One of the variables can be made to have a coefficient of 1 without introducing fractions.
