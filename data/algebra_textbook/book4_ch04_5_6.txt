Multiplying Fractions by Dividing Out Common Factors We have seen that to multiply two fractions together, we multiply numerators together, then denominators together, then reduce to lowest terms, if necessary. The reduction can be tedious if the numbers in the fractions are large. For example, We avoid the process of reducing if we divide out common factors before we multi­ply. Divide 3 into 9 and 21, and divide 2 into 10 and 16. The product is a fraction that is reduced to lowest terms. The Process of Multiplication by Dividing Out Common Factors To multiply fractions by dividing out common factors, divide out factors that are common to both a numerator and a denominator. The factor being divided out can appear in any numerator and any denominator. Sample Set B Perform the following multiplications. Example 4.34.  Divide 4 and 6 by 2 Divide 5 and 5 by 5 Example 4.35.  Divide 8 and 10 by 2. Divide 8 and 12 by 4.
