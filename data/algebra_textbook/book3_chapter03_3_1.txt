Number/Geometry Problems Example:  Find a number such that 5 more than one-half the number is three times the number. Let x be the unknown number.   Translating into math: 5 + x/2 = 3x Solving: (First multiply by 2 to clear the fraction) 5 + x/2 = 3x 10 + x = 6x 10 = 5x x = 2 Example:  If the perimeter of a rectangle is 10 inches, and one side is one inch longer than the other, how long are the sides? Let one side be x and the other side be x + 1. Then the given condition may be expressed as x + x + (x + 1) + (x + 1) = 10 Solving: 4x + 2 = 10 4x = 8 x = 2 so the sides have length 2 and 3.
