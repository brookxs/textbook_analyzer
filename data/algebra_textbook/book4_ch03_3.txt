 || Grouping Symbols Grouping symbols are used to indicate that a particular collection of numbers and meaningful operations are to be grouped together and considered as one number. The grouping symbols commonly used in mathematics are the following: ( ), [ ], { }, ___ Parentheses: ( ) Brackets: [ ] Braces: { } Bar: ___ In a computation in which more than one operation is involved, grouping symbols indicate which operation to perform first. If possible, we perform operations inside grouping symbols first. Sample Set A If possible, determine the value of each of the following. Example 3.9.  9 + ( 3 ⋅ 8 ) Since 3 and 8 are within parentheses, they are to be combined first. Thus, 9 + ( 3 ⋅ 8 ) = 33 Example 3.10.  ( 10 ÷ 0 ) ⋅ 6 Since 10÷0 is undefined, this operation is meaningless, and we attach no value to it. We write, "undefined." Practice Set A If possible, determine the value of each of the following. Exercise 3.3.1. (Go to Solution) 16 − (3⋅2) Exercise 3.3.2. (Go to Solution) 5 + (7⋅9) Exercise 3.3.3. (Go to Solution) (4 + 8)⋅2 Exercise 3.3.4. (Go to Solution) 28÷(18 − 11) Exercise 3.3.5. (Go to Solution) (33÷3) − 11 Exercise 3.3.6. (Go to Solution) 4 + (0÷0)  || Multiple Grouping Symbols When a set of grouping symbols occurs inside another set of grouping symbols, we perform the operations within the innermost set first. Sample Set B Determine the value of each of the following. Example 3.11.  2 + ( 8 ⋅ 3 ) − ( 5 + 6 ) Combine 8 and 3 first, then combine 5 and 6. Example 3.12.  10 + [ 30 − ( 2 ⋅ 9 ) ] Combine 2 and 9 since they occur in the innermost set of parentheses. Practice Set B Determine the value of each of the following. Exercise 3.3.7. (Go to Solution) (17 + 8) + (9 + 20) Exercise 3.3.8. (Go to Solution) (55 − 6) − (13⋅2) Exercise 3.3.9. (Go to Solution) 23 + (12÷4) − (11⋅2) Exercise 3.3.10. (Go to Solution) 86 + [14÷(10 − 8)] Exercise 3.3.11. (Go to Solution) 31 + {9 + [1 + (35 − 2)]} Exercise 3.3.12. (Go to Solution) {6 − [24÷(4⋅2)]}3  || The Order of Operations Sometimes there are no grouping symbols indicating which operations to perform first. For example, suppose we wish to find the value of 3 + 5⋅2. We could do either of two things: Add 3 and 5, then multiply this sum by 2. Multiply 5 and 2, then add 3 to this product. We now have two values for one number. To determine the correct value, we must use the accepted order of operations. Order of Operations Perform all operations inside grouping symbols, beginning with the innermost set, in the order 2, 3, 4 described below, Perform all exponential and root operations. Perform all multiplications and divisions, moving left to right. Perform all additions and subtractions, moving left to right. Sample Set C Determine the value of each of the following. Example 3.13.  Example 3.14.  Example 3.15.  Example 3.16.  Example 3.17.  Example 3.18.  Practice Set C Determine the value of each of the following. Exercise 3.3.13. (Go to Solution) 8 + (32 − 7) Exercise 3.3.14. (Go to Solution) (34 + 18 − 2⋅3) + 11 Exercise 3.3.15. (Go to Solution) 8(10) + 4(2 + 3) − (20 + 3⋅15 + 40 − 5) Exercise 3.3.16. (Go to Solution) 5⋅8 + 42 − 22 Exercise 3.3.17. (Go to Solution) 4(62 − 33)÷(42 − 4) Exercise 3.3.18. (Go to Solution) (8 + 9⋅3)÷7 + 5⋅(8÷4 + 7 + 3⋅5) Exercise 3.3.19.

Example 3.19.  9, 842 + 56 ⋅ 85 Table 3.3.   Key   Display Reads Perform the multiplication first. Type 56 56   Press × 56   Type 85 85 Now perform the addition. Press + 4760   Type 9842 9842   Press = 14602 The display now reads 14,602. Example 3.20.  42 ( 27 + 18 ) + 105 ( 810 ÷ 18 ) Table 3.4.   Key   Display Reads Operate inside the parentheses Type 27 27   Press + 27   Type 18 18   Press = 45 Multiply by 42. Press × 45   Type 42 42   Press = 1890 Place this result into memory by pressing the memory key. Table 3.5.   Key   Display Reads Now operate in the other parentheses. Type 810 810   Press ÷ 810   Type 18 18   Press = 45 Now multiply by 105. Press × 45   Type 105 105   Press = 4725 We are now ready to add these two quantities together. Press + 4725 Press the memory recall key.     1890   Press = 6615 Thus, 42(27 + 18) + 105(810÷18) = 6,615 Example 3.21.  16 4 + 37 3 Table 3.6. Nonscientific Calculators Key   Display Reads Type 16 16 Press × 16 Type 16 16 Press × 256 Type 16 16 Press × 4096 Type 16 16 Press = 65536 Press the memory key     Type 37 37 Press × 37 Type 37 37 Press × 1396 Type 37 37 Press × 50653 Press + 50653 Press memory recall key   65536 Press = 116189 Table 3.7. Calculators with yx Key Key   Display Reads Type 16 16 Press y x 16 Type 4 4 Press = 4096 Press + 4096 Type 37 37 Press y x 37 Type 3 3 Press = 116189 Thus, 164 + 373 = 116,189 We can certainly see that the more powerful calculator simplifies computations. Example 3.22.  Nonscientific calculators are unable to handle calculations involving very large numbers. 85612 ⋅ 21065 Table 3.8. Key   Display Reads Type 85612 85612 Press × 85612 Type 21065 21065 Press =   This number is too big for the display of some calculators and we'll probably get some kind of error message. On some scientific calculators such large numbers are coped with by placing them in a form called "scientific notation." Others can do the multiplication directly.
