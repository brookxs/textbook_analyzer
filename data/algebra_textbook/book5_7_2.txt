Therefore, we place the decimal point in the product so that there are six digits to the right of the decimal point. However, the trailing zeros may be removed without changing the value of the product. That is, 1.234567 times 1000 is 1234.567. Note that the decimal point in the product is three places further to the right than in the original factor. This observation leads to the following result. Multiplying by a nonnegative power of ten. Multiplying a decimal num- ber by 10n, where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , will move the decimal point n places to the right. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify: 325.6783× 102.

Multiplying by 10−4 will move the decimal point four places to the left. In this case, we need to add some leading zeros at the beginning of the number to accomplish moving the decimal 4 places to the left. 4.3× 10−4 = 0.00043 Note also the leading zero before the decimal point.

SCIENTIFIC NOTATION 495  || Scientific Notation Form We start by defining the form of a number called scientific notation. Scientific notation. A number having the form a× 10b, where b is an integer and 1 ≤ |a| < 10, is said to be in scientific notation. The requirement 1 ≤ |a| < 10 says that the magnitude of a must be a least 1 and less than 10. • The number 12.34× 10−4 is not in scientific notation because |12.34| = 12.34 is larger than 10. • The number −0.95× 103 is not in scientific notation because |− 0.95| = 0.95 is less than 1. • The number 7.58× 10−12 is in scientific notation because |7.58| = 7.58 is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. • The number −1.0× 1015 is in scientific notation because |− 1.0| = 1.0 is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. After contemplating these examples, it follows that a number in scientific no- tation should have exactly one of the digits 1, 2, 3, . . . , 9 before the decimal point. Exactly one, no more, no less. Thus, each of the following numbers is in scientific notation. 4.7× 108, −3.764× 10−1, 3.2× 100, and − 1.25× 10−22  || Placing a Number in Scientific Notation To place a number into scientific notation, we need to move the decimal point so that exactly one of the digits 1, 2, 3, . . . , 9 remains to the left of the decimal point, then multiply by the appropriate power of 10 so that the result is equivalent to the original number. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Place the number 1,234 in scientific notation. Place the number 54,321 in scientific notation. Solution. Move the decimal point three places to the left so that it is posi- tioned just after the 1. To make this new number equal to 1,234, multiply by 103. Thus: 1, 234 = 1.234× 103 496 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS Check: Multiplying by 103 moves the decimal three places to the right, so: 1.234× 103 = 1, 234 This is the original number, so our scientific notation form is correct.Answer: 5.4321× 104 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Place the number 0.000025 in scientific notation.Place the number 0.0175 in scientific notation. Solution. Move the decimal point five places to the right so that it is posi- tioned just after the 2. To make this new number equal to 0.000025, multiply by 10−5. Thus: 0.000025 = 2.5× 10−5 Check: Multiplying by 10−5 moves the decimal five places to the left, so: 2.5× 10−5 = 0.000025 This is the original number, so our scientific notation form is correct.Answer: 1.75× 10−2 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Place the number 34.5× 10−11 in scientific notation.Place the number 756.98× 10−5 in scientific notation. Solution. First, move the decimal point one place to the left so that it is positioned just after the three. To make this new form equal to 34.5, multiply by 101. 34.5× 10−11 = 3.45× 101 × 10−11 Now, repeat the base 10 and add the exponents. = 3.45× 10−10 Answer: 7.5698× 10−3 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Place the number 0.00093× 1012 in scientific notation.Place the number 0.00824× 108 in scientific notation. Solution. First, move the decimal point four places to the right so that it is positioned just after the nine. To make this new form equal to 0.00093, multiply by 10−4. 0.00093× 1012 = 9.3× 10−4 × 1012 7.2. SCIENTIFIC NOTATION 497 Now, repeat the base 10 and add the exponents. = 9.3× 108 Answer: 8.24× 105 !  || Scientific Notation and the Graphing Calculator The TI-84 graphing calculator has a special button for entering numbers in scientific notation. Locate the “comma” key just about the number 7 key on the calculator’s keyboard (see Figure 7.1). Just above the “comma” key, printed on the calculator’s case is the symbol EE. It’s in the same color as the 2nd key, so you’ll have to use the 2nd key to access this symbol. Figure 7.1: Locate the EE label above the “comma” key on the keyboard. We know that 2.3 × 102 = 230. Let’s see if the calculator gives the same interpretation. 1. Enter 2.3. 2. Press the 2nd key, then the comma key. This will put E on the calculator view screen. 3. Enter a 2. 4. Press ENTER. The result of these steps is shown in the first image in Figure 7.2. Note that the calculator interprets 2.3E2 as 2.3× 102 and gives the correct answer, 230. You can continue entering numbers in scientific notation (see the middle image in Figure 7.2). However, at some point the numbers become too large and the calculator responds by outputting the numbers in scientific notaiton. You can also force your calculator to display numbers in scientific notation in all situations, by first pressing the MODE key, then selecting SCI on the first 498 CHAPTER 7.

Use the graphing calculator to simplify:Use the graphing calculator to simplify: (3.42× 106)(5.86× 10−9) (2.35× 10−12)(3.25× 10−4) Solution. First, note that we can approximate (2.35× 10−12)(3.25× 10−4) by taking the product of 2 and 3 and adding the powers of ten. (2.35× 10−12)(3.25× 10−4) ≈ (2 × 10−12)(3 × 10−4) Approximate: 2.35 ≈ 2 and 3.25 ≈ 3. ≈ 6× 10−16 2 · 3 = 6 and 10−12 · 10−4 = 10−16. The graphing calculator will provide an accurate answer. Enter 2.35E-12, press the “times” button, then enter 3.25E-4 and press the ENTER button. Be sure to use the “negate” button and not the “subtract” button to produce the minus sign. The result is shown in Figure 7.3. Figure 7.3: Computing (2.35× 10−12)(3.25× 10−4). Thus, (2.35× 10−12)(3.25× 10−4) = 7.6375× 10−16. Note that this is fairly close to our estimate of 6× 10−16.Answer: 2.00412× 10−2 ! 7.2. SCIENTIFIC NOTATION 499 Reporting your answer on your homework. After computing the answer to Example 11 on your calculator, write the following on your homework: (2.35× 10−12)(3.25× 10−4) = 7.6375× 10−16 Do not write 7.6375E-16. You Try It! EXAMPLE 12.

Again, it is not difficult to produce an approximate answer. 6.1× 10−3 (2.7× 104)(1.1 × 108) ≈ 6× 10 −3 (3× 104)(1× 108) 6.1 ≈ 6, 2.7 ≈ 3, and 1.1 ≈ 1. ≈ 6× 10 −3 3× 1012 3 · 1 = 3 and 10 4 · 108 = 1012. ≈ 6 3 · 10 −3 1012 ac bd = a b · c d . ≈ 2× 10−15 6 3 = 2 and 10−3 1012 = 10−15. Let’s get a precise answer with our calculator. Enter the numerator as 6.1E- 3, then press the “division” button. Remember that we must surround the denominator with parentheses. So press the open parentheses key, then enter 2.7E4. Press the “times” key, then enter 1.1E8. Press the close parentheses key and press the ENTER button. The result is shown in Figure 7.4. Figure 7.4: Computing 6.1× 10−3/(2.7× 104 × 1.1× 108). Thus, 6.1× 10−3/(2.7× 104 × 1.1× 108) = 2.05387205× 10−15. Note that this is fairly close to our estimate of 2× 10−15.

Find the force of attraction between the earth and the station (in newtons (N)). the formula F = GmM r2 where F is the force of attraction between two objects having mass m and M , r is the distance between the two objects, and G is Newton’s gravitational constant defined by: G = 6.67428× 10−11 N(m/kg)2 Given that the mass of the moon is 7.3477× 1022 kilograms (kg), the mass of the earth is 5.9736×1024 kilograms (kg), and the average distance between the moon and the earth is 3.84403 × 108 meters (m), find the force of attraction between the earth and the moon (in newtons (N)). Solution. Plug the given numbers into Newton’s universal law of gravitation.

A light-year is the distance that light will travel in 7.2. SCIENTIFIC NOTATION 501 one-year’s time. The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second. How many miles from the earth is Alpha Centauri? Solution: Because the speed of light is measured in miles per second, let’s first compute the number of seconds in 4.37 years. Because there are 365 days in a year, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute, we can write: 4.37 yr = 4.37 yr× 365 day yr × 24 hr day × 60 min hr × 60 s min = 4.37"yr × 365 # #day "yr × 24 "hr ##day × 60 # #min "hr × 60 s ##min Note how the units cancel, indicating that the final answer is in seconds. With our calculator mode set to scientific notation (see the image on the right in Figure 7.2), we multiply the numbers to get the result shown in Figure 7.6. Rounding, the number of seconds in 4.37 years is approximately 1.38 × 108 seconds. Next, we compute the distance the light travels in 4.37 years. Using the fact that the distance traveled equals the speed times the time traveled, we have: Distance = Speed× Time = 1.86× 105 mi s · 1.38× 108 s = 1.86× 105 mi $s · 1.38× 108 $s Note how the units cancel, indicating that our answer is in miles. Again, with our calculator set in scientific notation mode, we compute the product of 1.86 × 105 and 1.38 × 108. The result is shown in the image on the right in Figure 7.6. Figure 7.6: Computing the distance to Alpha Centauri in miles. Thus, the star Alpha Centauri is approximately 2.5668 × 1013 miles from the earth, or 2.5668× 1013 miles ≈ 25, 668, 000, 000, 000miles, pronounced “twenty-five quadrillion, six hundred sixty-eight trillion miles.” Answer: ≈ 5.2425× 1013 miles ! 502 CHAPTER 7.
