Reading Root Notation There is a symbol used to indicate roots of a number. It is called the radical sign The Radical Sign The symbol is called a radical sign and indicates the nth root of a number. We discuss particular roots using the radical sign as follows: Square Root indicates the square root of the number under the radical sign. It is customary to drop the 2 in the radical sign when discussing square roots. The symbol is understood to be the square root radical sign. = 7 since 7⋅7 = 72 = 49 Cube Root indicates the cube root of the number under the radical sign. since 2⋅2⋅2 = 23 = 8 Fourth Root indicates the fourth root of the number under the radical sign. since 3⋅3⋅3⋅3 = 34 = 81 In an expression such as Radical Sign is called the radical sign. Index 5 is called the index. (The index describes the indicated root.) Radicand 32 is called the radicand. Radical is called a radical (or radical expression). Sample Set B Find each root. Example 3.5.  To determine the square root of 25, we ask, "What whole number squared equals 25?" From our experience with multiplication, we know this number to be 5. Thus, Check: 5 ⋅ 5 = 5 2 = 25 Example 3.6.  To determine the fifth root of 32, we ask, "What whole number raised to the fifth power equals 32?" This number is 2. Check: 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 = 2 5 = 32 Practice Set B Find the following roots using only a knowledge of multiplication. Exercise 3.2.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 3.2.8. (Go to Solution) Exercise 3.2.9.
