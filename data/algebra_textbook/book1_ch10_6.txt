 || Standard Form Of A Quadratic Equation We have observed that a quadratic equation is an equation of the formwhere a is the coefficient of the quadratic term, b is the coefficient of the linear term, and c is the constant term. Standard Form The equation a x 2 + b x + c = 0 is the standard form of a quadratic equation.  || The Quadratic Formula When a quadratic equation is written in standard form so that the values a, b, and c are readily determined, the equation can be solved using the quadratic formula. The values that satisfy the equation are found by substituting the values a, b, and c into the formula Quadratic Formula Keep in mind that the plus or minus symbol, ± , is just a shorthand way of denoting the two possibilities:The quadratic formula can be derived by using the method of completing the square.  || Derivation Of The Quadratic Formula Solve a x 2 + b x + c = 0 for x by completing the square. Example 10.39.  Subtract c from both sides. a x 2 + b x = − c Example 10.40.  Divide both sides by a, the coefficient of x 2 . Example 10.41.  Now we have the proper form to complete the square. Take one half the coefficient of x, square it, and add the result to both sides of the equation found in step 2.(a) is one half the coefficient of x. (b) is the square of one half the coefficient of x. Example 10.42.  The left side of the equation is now a perfect square trinomial and can be factored. This gives us Example 10.43.  Add the two fractions on the right side of the equation. The LCD = 4a 2 . Example 10.44.  Solve for x using the method of extraction of roots.  ||
