Isolating the Variable in Two Steps A linear equation of the form a x + b = c takes two steps to solve. First, use the appropriate equality property of addition or subtraction to isolate the variable term. Next, isolate the variable using the equality property of multiplication or division. Checking solutions in the following examples is left to the reader.   Example 7: Solve: 2 x − 5 = 15 . Solution: Answer: The solution is 10.   Example 8: Solve: − 3 x − 2 = 9 . Solution: Answer: The solution is − 11 3 .   Example 9: Solve: 6 − 5 y = − 14 . Solution: When no sign precedes the term, it is understood to be positive. In other words, think of this as + 6 − 5 y = − 14 . Begin by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equal sign. Answer: The solution is 4.   Example 10: Solve: 3 x + 1 2 = 2 3 . Solution: Answer: The solution is 1 18 .   Example 11: Solve: 3 − y = 1 . Solution: Recall that − y is equivalent to − 1 y ; divide both sides of the equation by −1. Alternatively, multiply both sides of − y = − 2 by −1 and achieve the same result: Answer: The solution is 2.   In summary, to retain equivalent equations, we must perform the same operation on both sides of the equation. First, apply the addition or subtraction property of equality to isolate the variable term and then apply the multiplication or division property of equality to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.   Try this! Solve: − 7 x + 6 = 27 . Answer: x = − 3 Video Solution Isolating the Variable in Two Steps A linear equation of the form a x + b = c takes two steps to solve.
