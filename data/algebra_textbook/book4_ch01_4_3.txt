The Method of Rounding Whole Numbers From the observations made in the preceding examples, we can use the following method to round a whole number to a particular position. Mark the position of the round-off digit. Note the digit to the immediate right of the round-off digit. If it is less than 5, replace it and all the digits to its right with zeros. Leave the round-off digit unchanged. If it is 5 or larger, replace it and all the digits to its right with zeros. Increase the round-off digit by 1. Sample Set A Use the method of rounding whole numbers to solve the following problems. Example 1.16.  Round 3,426 to the nearest ten. We are rounding to the tens position. Mark the digit in the tens position Observe the digit immediately to the right of the tens position. It is 6. Since 6 is greater than 5, we round up by replacing 6 with 0 and adding 1 to the digit in the tens position (the round-off position): 2 + 1 = 3 . 3,430 Thus, 3,426 rounded to the nearest ten is 3,430. Example 1.17.  Round 9,614,018,007 to the nearest ten million. We are rounding to the nearest ten million. Observe the digit immediately to the right of the ten millions position. It is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we round down by replacing 4 and all the digits to its right with zeros. 9,610,000,000 Thus, 9,614,018,007 rounded to the nearest ten million is 9,610,000,000. Example 1.18.  Round 148,422 to the nearest million. Since we are rounding to the nearest million, we'll have to imagine a digit in the millions position. We'll write 148,422 as 0,148,422. The digit immediately to the right is 1. Since 1 is less than 5, we'll round down by replacing it and all the digits to its right with zeros. 0,000,000 This number is 0. Thus, 148,422 rounded to the nearest million is 0. Example 1.19.  Round 397,000 to the nearest ten thousand. We are rounding to the nearest ten thousand. The digit immediately to the right of the ten thousand position is 7. Since 7 is greater than 5, we round up by replacing 7 and all the digits to its right with zeros and adding 1 to the digit in the ten thousands position. But 9 + 1 = 10 and we must carry the 1 to the next (the hundred thousands) position. 400,000 Thus, 397,000 rounded to the nearest ten thousand is 400,000. Practice Set A Use the method of rounding whole numbers to solve each problem. Exercise 1.4.1. (Go to Solution) Round 3387 to the nearest hundred. Exercise 1.4.2. (Go to Solution) Round 26,515 to the nearest thousand. Exercise 1.4.3. (Go to Solution) Round 30,852,900 to the nearest million. Exercise 1.4.4. (Go to Solution) Round 39 to the nearest hundred. Exercise 1.4.5. (Go to Solution) Round 59,600 to the nearest thousand.
