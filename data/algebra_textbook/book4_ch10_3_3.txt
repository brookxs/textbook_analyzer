Reading Signed Numbers The plus and minus signs now have two meanings: The plus sign can denote the operation of addition or a positive number. The minus sign can denote the operation of subtraction or a negative number. To avoid any confusion between "sign" and "operation," it is preferable to read the sign of a number as "positive" or "negative." When "+" is used as an operation sign, it is read as "plus." When " – " is used as an operation sign, it is read as "minus." Sample Set A Read each expression so as to avoid confusion between "operation" and "sign." Example 10.6.  – 8 should be read as "negative eight" rather than "minus eight." Example 10.7.  4 + ( – 2) should be read as "four plus negative two" rather than "four plus minus two." Example 10.8.  – 6 + ( – 3)should be read as "negative six plus negative three" rather than "minus six plus minus three." Example 10.9.  – 15 – ( – 6)should be read as "negative fifteen minus negative six" rather than "minus fifteen minus minus six." Example 10.10.  – 5 + 7 should be read as "negative five plus seven" rather than "minus five plus seven." Example 10.11.  0 – 2 should be read as "zero minus two." Practice Set A Write each expression in words. Exercise 10.3.1. (Go to Solution) 6 + 1 Exercise 10.3.2. (Go to Solution) 2 + ( – 8) Exercise 10.3.3. (Go to Solution) – 7 + 5 Exercise 10.3.4.
