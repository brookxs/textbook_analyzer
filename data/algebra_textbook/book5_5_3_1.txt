Zeros and x-intercepts of a Function Recall that f(x) and y are interchangeable.

Zeros and x-intercepts. The points where the graph of f crosses the x-axis are called the x-intercepts of the graph of f . The x-value of each x-intercept is called a zero of the function f . 326 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS The graph of f crosses the x-axis in Figure 5.24 at (−3, 0), (−1, 0), and (3, 0). Therefore: • The x-intercepts of f are: (−3, 0), (−1, 0), and (3, 0) • The zeros of f are: −3, −1, and 3 Key idea. A function is zero where its graph crosses the x-axis. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Find the zero(s) of the function f(x) = 1.5x+ 5.25.Find the zero(s) of the function f(x) = 2.6x− 9.62. Algebraic solution: Remember, f(x) = 1.5x+ 5.25 and y = 1.5x+ 5.25 are equivalent. We’re looking for the value of x that makes y = 0 or f(x) = 0. So, we’ll start with f(x) = 0, then replace f(x) with 1.5x+ 5.25. f(x) = 0 We want the value of x that makes the function equal to zero. 1.5x+ 5.25 = 0 Replace f(x) with 1.5x+ 5.25. Now we solve for x. 1.5x = −5.25 Subtract 5.25 from both sides. x = −5.25 1.5 Divide both sides by 1.5. x = −3.5 Divide: −5.25/1.5 = −3.5 Check. Substitute −3.5 for x in the function f(x) = 1.5x+ 5.25. f(x) = 1.5x+ 5.25 The original function. f(−3.5) = 1.5(−3.5) + 5.25 Substitute −3.5 for x. f(−3.5) = −5.25 + 5.25 Multiply: 1.5(−3.5) = −5.25. f(−3.5) = 0 Add. Note that −3.5, when substituted for x, makes the function f(x) = 1.5x+5.25 equal to zero. This is why −3.5 is called a zero of the function. Graphing calculator solution. We should be able to find the zero by sketch- ing the graph of f and noting where it crosses the x-axis. Start by loading the function f(x) = 1.5x + 5.25 into Y1 in the Y= menu (see the first image in Figure 5.25). Select 6:ZStandard from the ZOOM menu to produce the graph of f (see the second image in Figure 5.25). Press 2ND CALC to open the the CALCULATE menu (see the third image in Figure 5.25).

The calculator responds by asking for a “Left Bound?” (see the first image in Figure 5.26). Use the left arrow button to move the cursor so that it lies to the left of the x-intercept of f and press ENTER. 2. The calculator responds by asking for a “Right Bound?” (see the second image in Figure 5.26). Use the right arrow button to move the cursor so that it lies to the right of the x-intercept of f and press ENTER. 3.

As long as your cursor lies between the left- and right-bound marks at the top of the screen (see the third image in Figure 5.26), you have a valid guess. Since the cursor already lies between the left- and right-bounds, simply press ENTER to use the current position of the cursor as your guess. Figure 5.26: Using 2:zero from the CALCULATE menu. The calculator responds by approximating the zero of the function as shown in Figure 5.27. Figure 5.27: −3.5 is a zero of f . Note that the approximation found using the calculator agrees nicely with the zero found using the algebraic technique. Answer: 3.7 ! 328 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. How long will it take the projectile in Example 2 to returnIf a projectile is launched with an initial velocity of 60 meters per second from a rooftop 12 meters above ground level, at what time will the projectile return to ground level? to ground level? Solution: In Example 2, the height of the projectile above the ground as a function of time is given by the equation y = 8 + 100t− 4.9t2. When the projectile returns to the ground, its height above ground will be zero meters. To find the time that this happens, substitute y = 0 in the last equation and solve for t. 0 = 8 + 100t− 4.9t2 Enter the equation y = 8 + 100t − 4.9t2 into Y1 in the Y= menu of your calculator (see the first image in Figure 5.28), then set the WINDOW param-In this example, the horizontal axis is actually the t-axis.
