Combining Like Terms We can use the distributive property to distribute a number times a sum. a(b+ c) = ab+ ac However, the distributive property can also be used in reverse, to “unmultiply” or factor an expression. Thus, we can start with the expression ab + ac and “factor out” the common factor a as follows: ab+ ac = a(b+ c) You can also factor out the common factor on the right. ac+ bc = (a+ b)c We can use this latter technique to combine like terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Simplify: 7x+ 5xSimplify: 3y + 8y Solution: Use the distributive property to factor out the common factor x from each term, then simplify the result. 7x+ 5x = (7 + 5)x Factor out an x using the distributive property. = 12x Simplify: 7 + 5 = 12 Thus, 7x+ 5x = 12x.Answer: 11y !

Simplify: −8a2 + 5a2Simplify: −5z3 + 9z3 Solution: Use the distributive property to factor out the common factor a2 from each term, then simplify the result. −8a2 + 5a2 = (−8 + 5)a2 Factor out an a2 using the distributive property. = −3a2 Simplify: −8 + 5 = −3 Thus, −8a2 + 5a2 = −3a2.Answer: 4z3 ! Examples 8 and 9 combine what are known as “like terms.” Examples 8 and 9 also suggest a possible shortcut for combining like terms. 1.5. ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 65 Like Terms. Two terms are called like terms if they have identical variable parts, which means that the terms must contain the same variables raised to the same exponents. For example, 2x2y and 11x2y are like terms because they contain identical variables raised to the same exponents. On the other hand, −3st2 and 4s2t are not like terms. They contain the same variables, but the variables are not raised to the same exponents. Consider the like terms 2x2y and 11x2y. The numbers 2 and 11 are called the coefficients of the like terms. We can use the distributive property to combine these like terms as we did in Examples 8 and 9, factoring out the common factor x2y. 2x2y + 11x2y = (2 + 11)x2y = 13x2y However, a much quicker approach is simply to add the coefficients of the like terms, keeping the same variable part. That is, 2 + 11 = 13, so: 2x2y + 11x2y = 13x2y This is the procedure we will follow from now on. You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Simplify: −8w2 + 17w2 Simplify: 4ab− 15ab Solution: These are like terms. If we add the coefficients −8 and 17, we get 9. Thus: −8w2 + 17w2 = 9w2 Add the coefficients and repeat the variable part. Answer: −11ab ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Simplify: −4uv − 9uv Simplify: −3xy − 8xy Solution: These are like terms. If we add −4 and −9, we get −13. Thus: −4uv − 9uv = −13uv Add the coefficients and repeat the variable part. Answer: −11xy !

They do have the same variables, but the variables are not raised to the same exponents. Consequently, this expression is already simplified as much as possible. −3x2y + 2xy2 Unlike terms. Already simplified. Answer: 5ab+ 11bc ! Sometimes we have more than just a single pair of like terms. In that case, we want to group together the like terms and combine them. You Try It! EXAMPLE 13. Simplify: −8u− 4v − 12u+ 9vSimplify: −3z2 + 4z − 8z2 − 9z Solution: Use the associative and commutative property of addition to change the order and regroup, then combine line terms. −8u− 4v − 12u+ 9v = (−8u− 12u) + (−4v + 9v) Reorder and regroup. = −20u+ 5v Combine like terms. Note that −8u− 12u = −20u and −4v + 9v = 5v. Alternate solution. You may skip the reordering and regrouping step if you wish, simply combining like terms mentally. That is, it is entirely possible to order your work as follows: −8u− 4v − 12u+ 9v = −20u+ 5v Combine like terms. Answer: −11z2 − 5z ! In Example 13, the “Alternate solution” allows us to move more quickly and will be the technique we follow from here on, grouping and combining terms mentally.
