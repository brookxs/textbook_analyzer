The Method of Solving A System Graphically The Method of Solving a System Graphically To solve a system of equations graphically: Graph both equations. If the lines intersect, the solution is the ordered pair that corresponds to the point of intersection. The system is independent. If the lines are parallel, there is no solution. The system is inconsistent. If the lines are coincident, there are infinitely many solutions. The system is dependent.
