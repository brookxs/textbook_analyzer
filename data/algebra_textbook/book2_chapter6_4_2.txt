Sum and Difference of Cubes Two other special binomials of interest are the sum a 3 + b 3 = ( a + b ) ( a 2 − a b + b 2 ) , where a and b represent algebraic expressions. and difference of cubes a 3 − b 3 = ( a − b ) ( a 2 + a b + b 2 ) , where a and b represent algebraic expressions. : We can verify these formulas by multiplying: The process for factoring the sum and difference of cubes is very similar to that for the difference of squares. We first identify a and b and then substitute into the appropriate formula. The separate formulas for sum and difference of cubes allow us to always choose a and b to be positive.   Example 6: Factor: x 3 + 8 . Solution: The plus sign and the fact that the terms are cubes indicate to us that this is a sum of cubes. Next, identify what is being cubed. In this case, a = x and b = 2 . Substitute into the sum of cubes formula. The resulting trinomial is prime and the factoring is complete. We can check this factorization by multiplying. Answer: ( x + 2 ) ( x 2 − 2 x + 4 )   It is helpful to review the perfect cubes of integers from 1 to 12. This will aid you in identifying sums and differences of cubes.   Example 7: Factor: y 3 − 125 . Solution: In this case, we have a difference of cubes. We can write Substitute a = y and b = 5 into the formula for difference of cubes. Answer: ( y − 5 ) ( y 2 + 5 y + 25 )   Always look for common factors when factoring. If the terms of the binomial have a GCF other than 1, then factor that out first.   Example 8: Factor: 54 x 4 + 128 x . Solution: Begin by factoring out the GCF 2 x . The resulting binomial factor is a sum of cubes, where a = 3 x and b = 4 . Answer: 2 x ( 3 x + 4 ) ( 9 x 2 − 12 x + 16 )   Example 9: Factor: x 3 y 3 − 1 . Solution: This binomial is a difference of cubes with two variables. Identify what is being cubed. Here a = x y and b = 1 . Substitute into the appropriate formula and simplify. Answer: ( x y − 1 ) ( x 2 y 2 + x y + 1 )   Try this! Factor: 8 x 3 + 343 . Answer: ( 2 x + 7 ) ( 4 x 2 − 14 x + 49 ) Video Solution When factoring, always look for resulting factors to factor further.   Example 10: Factor completely: x 6 − 64 . Solution: When confronted with a binomial that is both a difference of squares and cubes, as this is, make it a rule to factor using difference of squares first. Therefore, a = x 3 and b = 8 . Substitute into the difference of squares formula. The resulting two binomial factors are a sum and a difference of cubes. Each can be factored further. Therefore, we have The trinomial factors are prime and the expression is completely factored. Answer: ( x + 2 ) ( x 2 − 2 x + 4 ) ( x − 2 ) ( x 2 + 2 x + 4 )   As an exercise, factor the previous example as a difference of cubes first and then compare the results. Why do you think we make it a rule to factor using difference of squares first?   Try this! Factor: x 6 − y 6 .
