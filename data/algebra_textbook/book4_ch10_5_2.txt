Addition of Numbers with Like Signs The addition of the two positive numbers 2 and 3 is performed on the number line as follows. Begin at 0, the origin. Since 2 is positive, move 2 units to the right. Since 3 is positive, move 3 more units to the right. We are now located at 5. Thus, 2 + 3 = 5. Summarizing, we have ( 2 positive units ) + ( 3 positive units ) = ( 5 positive units ) The addition of the two negative numbers -2 and -3 is performed on the number line as follows. Begin at 0, the origin. Since -2 is negative, move 2 units to the left. Since -3 is negative, move 3 more units to the left. We are now located at -5. Thus, ( − 2) + ( − 3) = − 5. Summarizing, we have ( 2 negative units ) + ( 3 negative units ) = ( 5 negative units ) Observing these two examples, we can suggest these relationships: ( positive number ) + ( positive number ) = ( positive number ) ( negative number ) + ( negative number ) = ( negative number ) Adding Numbers with the Same Sign Addition of numbers with like sign: To add two real numbers that have the same sign, add the absolute values of the numbers and associate with the sum the common sign. Sample Set A Find the sums. Example 10.21.  3 + 7 Add these absolute values. 3 + 7 = 10 The common sign is “+.” Thus, 3 + 7 = + 10, or 3 + 7 = 10. Example 10.22.  ( − 4) + ( − 9) Add these absolute values. 4 + 9 = 13 The common sign is “ – .“ Thus, ( − 4) + ( − 9) = − 13. Practice Set A Find the sums. Exercise 10.5.1.
