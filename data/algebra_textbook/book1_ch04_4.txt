 || Polynomials Polynomials Let us consider the collection of all algebraic expressions that do not contain variables in the denominators of fractions and where all exponents on the variable quantities are whole numbers. Expressions in this collection are called polynomials. Some expressions that are polynomials are Example 4.38.  3x 4 Example 4.39.  .A fraction occurs, but no variable appears in the denominator. Example 4.40.  5x 3 + 3x 2 − 2x + 1 Some expressions that are not polynomials are Example 4.41.  .A variable appears in the denominator. Example 4.42.  4x 2 − 5x + x − 3 .A negative exponent appears on a variable.  || Classification of Polynomials Polynomials can be classified using two criteria: the number of terms and degree of the polynomial. Table 4.1. Number of Terms Name Example Comment One Monomial 4x 2 mono means “one” in Greek. Two Binomial 4x 2 − 7x bi means “two” in Latin. Three Trinomial 4x 2 − 7x + 3 tri means “three” in Greek. Four or more Polynomial 4x 3 − 7x 2 + 3x − 1 poly means “many” in Greek. Degree of a Term Containing One Variable The degree of a term containing only one variable is the value of the exponent of the variable. Exponents appearing on numbers do not affect the degree of the term. We consider only the exponent of the variable. For example: Example 4.43.  5x 3 is a monomial of degree 3. Example 4.44.  60a 5 is a monomial of degree 5. Example 4.45.  21b 2 is a monomial of degree 2. Example 4.46.  8 is a monomial of degree 0. We say that a nonzero number is a term of 0 degree since it could be written as 8x 0 . Since x 0 = 1(x ≠ 0) , 8x 0 = 8 . The exponent on the variable is 0 so it must be of degree 0. (By convention, the number 0 has no degree.) Example 4.47.  4x is a monomial of the first degree. 4x could be written as 4x 1 . The exponent on the variable is 1 so it must be of the first degree. Degree of a Term Containing Several Variables The degree of a term containing more than one variable is the sum of the exponents of the variables, as shown below. Example 4.48.  4x 2 y 5 is a monomial of degree 2 + 5 = 7 . This is a 7th degree monomial. Example 4.49.  37a b 2 c 6 d 3 is a monomial of degree 1 + 2 + 6 + 3 = 12 . This is a 12th degree monomial. Example 4.50.  5x y is a monomial of degree 1 + 1 = 2 . This is a 2nd degree monomial. Degree of a Polynomial The degree of a polynomial is the degree of the term of highest degree; for example: Example 4.51.  2x 3 + 6x − 1 is a trinomial of degree 3. The first term, 2x 3 , is the term of the highest degree. Therefore, its degree is the degree of the polynomial. Example 4.52.  7y − 10y 4 is a binomial of degree 4. Example 4.53.  a − 4 + 5a 2 is a trinomial of degree 2. Example 4.54.  2x 6 + 9x 4 − x 7 − 8x 3 + x − 9 is a polynomial of degree 7. Example 4.55.  4x 3 y 5 − 2x y 3 is a binomial of degree 8. The degree of the first term is 8. Example 4.56.  3x + 10 is a binomial of degree 1. Linear Quadratic Cubic Polynomials of the first degree are called linear polynomials.Polynomials of the second degree are called quadratic polynomials.Polynomials of the third degree are called cubic polynomials.Polynomials of the fourth degree are called fourth degree polynomials.Polynomials of the n th degree are called n th degree polynomials. Nonzero constants are polynomials of the 0th degree. Some examples of these polynomials follow: Example 4.57.  4x − 9 is a linear polynomial. Example 4.58.  3x 2 + 5x − 7 is a quadratic polynomial. Example 4.59.  8y − 2x 3 is a cubic polynomial. Example 4.60.  16a 2 − 32a 5 − 64 is a 5th degree polynomial. Example 4.61.  x 12 − y 12 is a 12th degree polynomial. Example 4.62.  7x 5 y 7 z 3 − 2x 4 y 7 z + x 3 y 7 is a 15th degree polynomial. The first term is of degree 5 + 7 + 3 = 15 . Example 4.63.  43 is a 0th degree polynomial.  || Classification of Polynomial Equations As we know, an equation is composed of two algebraic expressions separated by an equal sign. If the two expressions happen to be polynomial expressions, then we can classify the equation according to its degree. Classification of equations by degree is useful since equations of the same degree have the same type of graph. (We will study graphs of equations in Chapter 6.) The degree of an equation is the degree of the highest degree expression.  ||
