Dividing a Denominate Number by a Whole Number Dividing a Denominate Number by a Whole Number To divide a denominate number by a whole number, divide the number part of each unit by the whole number beginning with the largest unit. Affix the unit to this quotient. Carry any remainder to the next unit. Sample Set D Perform the following divisions. Simplify if necessary. Example 9.18.  (12 min 40 sec)÷4 Thus (12 min 40 sec)÷4 = 3 min 10 sec Example 9.19.  (5 yd 2 ft 9 in.)÷3 Thus (5 yd 2 ft 9 in.)÷3 = 1 yd 2 ft 11 in. Practice Set D Perform the following divisions. Simplify if necessary. Exercise 9.4.17. (Go to Solution) (18 hr 36 min)÷9 Exercise 9.4.18. (Go to Solution) (34 hr 8 min.)÷8 Exercise 9.4.19. (Go to Solution) (13 yd 7 in.)÷5 Exercise 9.4.20.
