6.4. FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A != 1 427 6.4 Factoring ax2 + bx + c when a != 1 In this section we continue to factor trinomials of the form ax2 + bx + c. In the last section, all of our examples had a = 1, and we were able to “Drop in place” our circled integer pair. However, in this section, a != 1, and we’ll soon see that we will not be able to use the “Drop in place” technique. However, readers will be pleased to learn that the ac-method will still apply. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Factor: 2x2 − 7x− 15. Factor: 3x2 + 13x+ 14 Solution: We proceed as follows: 1. Compare 2x2 − 7x − 15 with ax2 + bx + c and identify a = 2, b = −7, and c = −15. Note that the leading coefficient is a = 2, so this case is different from all of the cases discussed in Section 6.3. 2. Calculate ac. Note that ac = (2)(−15), so ac = −30. 3. List all integer pairs whose product is ac = −30. 1,−30 −1, 30 2,−15 −2, 15 3,−10 −3, 10 5,−6 −5, 6 4. Circle the ordered pair whose sum is b = −7. 1,−30 −1, 30 2,−15 −2, 15 3,−10 −3, 10 5,−6 −5, 6 5. Note that if we “drop in place” our circled ordered pair, (x+3)(x−10) != 2x2 − 7x− 15. Right off the bat, the product of the terms in the “First” position does not equal 2x2. Instead, we break up the middle term of 2x2 − 7x − 15 into a sum of like terms using our circled pair of integers 3 and −10. 2x2−7x− 15 = 2x2+3x− 10x− 15 Now we factor by grouping. Factor x out of the first two terms and −5 out of the second two terms. = x (2x+ 3)− 5 (2x+ 3) Now we can factor out (2x+ 3). = (x − 5)(2x+ 3) 428 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING 6. Use the FOIL shortcut to mentally check your answer. To multiply (x− 5)(2x+ 3), use these steps: • Multiply the terms in the “First” positions: 2x2. • Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and com- bine the results mentally: 3x− 10x = −7x. • Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions: −15. That is: F O I L (x − 5)(2x+ 3) = 2x2 + 3x − 10x − 15 Combining like terms, (x − 5)(2x + 3) = 2x2 − 7x − 15, which is the original trinomial, so our solution checks. Note that if you combine the “Outer” and “Inner” products mentally, the check goes even faster. Answer: (x+ 2)(3x+ 7) ! 6.4.

Factor x out of the first two terms and −5 out of the second two terms. = x (2x+ 3)− 5 (2x+ 3) Now we can factor out (2x+ 3). = (x − 5)(2x+ 3) 428 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING 6.

Note that if you combine the “Outer” and “Inner” products mentally, the check goes even faster. Answer: (x+ 2)(3x+ 7) !  || Speeding Things Up a Bit Some readers might already be asking “Do I really have to list all of those ordered pairs if I already see the pair I need?” The answer is “No!” If you see the pair you need, use it to break up the middle term of the trinomial as a sum of like terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Factor: 3x2 − 7x− 6.Factor: 2x2 − 9x+ 10 Solution: Compare 3x2−7x−6 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 3, b = −7, and c = −6. Calculate ac = (3)(−6), so ac = −18. Now can you think of an integer pair whose product is ac = −18 and whose sum is b = −7? For some, the pair just pops into their head: 2 and −9. Break up the middle term into a sum of like terms using the pair 2 and −9. 3x2−7x− 6 = 3x2+2x− 9x− 6 −7x = 2x− 9x. = x (3x+ 2)− 3 (3x+ 2) Factor by grouping. = (x − 3)(3x+ 2) Factor out (3x+ 2). Use the FOIL shortcut to check your answer. F O I L (x− 3)(3x+ 2) = 3x2 + 2x − 9x − 6 6.4. FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A != 1 429 Combining like terms, (x−3)(3x+2) = 3x2−7x−6, the original trinomial. Our solution checks. Note that if you combine the “Outer” and “Inner” products mentally, the check goes even faster. Answer: (x − 2)(2x− 5) ! On the other hand, some readers might be saying “Well, the needed ordered pair is not popping into my head. Do I have a way of cutting down the work?” The answer is “Yes!” As you are listing the ordered pairs whose product equals ac, be mindful that you need the ordered pair whose sum is b. If you stumble across the needed pair, stop the listing process and “drop” your ordered pair in place. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Factor: 3x2 − 33x+ 54. Factor: 5x2 − 35x− 40 Solution: Compare 3x2 − 33x + 54 with ax2 + bx + c and note that a = 3, b = −33, and c = 54. Calculate ac = (3)(54), so ac = 162. Ouch! That’s a big number! However, start listing the integer pairs whose product is ac = 162, but be mindful that you need an integer pair whose sum is b = −33. 1, 162 2, 81 3, 54 6, 27 −6,−27 As soon as we wrote down the pair 6 and 27, our mind said “the sum of 6 and 7 is 33.” However, we need the sum to equal b = −33, so we boxed −6 and −27 instead. Next, we break up the middle term into a sum of like terms using our circled pair. 3x2−33x− 54 = 3x2−6x− 27x− 54 −33x = −6x− 27x. = 3x (x− 2)− 27(x− 2) Factor by grouping. = (3x− 27)(x− 2) Factor out (x− 2). Oh-oh! Now we realize we can factor 3 out of each term in the first factor! = 3(x− 9)(x− 2) We missed taking out the GCF! Let’s try again, only this time let’s do what we are always supposed to do in the first step: Factor out the GCF. 3x2 − 33x+ 54 = 3(x2 − 11x+ 18) 430 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING Comparing x2 − 11x + 18 with ax2 + bx + c, we see that a = 1, b = −11, and c = 18. We need an integer pair whose product is ac = 18 and whose sum is b = −11. Note that these numbers are considerably smaller than the numbers we had to deal with when we forgot to first factor out the GCF. Because the numbers are smaller, the integer pair −9 and −2 easily comes to mind. Furthermore, because a = 1, we can factor x2 − 11x + 18 by simply dropping the integer pair −9 and −2 in place. 3(x2 − 11x+ 18) = 3(x− 9)(x− 2) A far simpler solution!Answer: 5(x− 8)(x+ 1) ! In Example 3, we saw how much more difficult we made the problem by forgetting to first factor out the greatest common factor (GCF). Let’s try not to make that mistake again. First rule of factoring. The first step in factoring any polynomial is to factor out the greatest common factor. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Factor: 30x3 − 21x2 − 18x.Factor: 12x4 + 2x3 − 30x2 Solution: Note that the GCF of 30x3, 21x2, and 18x is 3x. Factor out this GCF. 30x3 − 21x2 − 18x = 3x · 10x2 − 3x · 7x− 3x · 6 = 3x(10x2 − 7x− 6) Next, compare 10x2 − 7x− 6 with ax2 + bx+ c and note that a = 10, b = −7, and c = −6. Start listing the integer pairs whose product is ac = −60, but be mindful that you need an integer pair whose sum is b = −7. 1,−60 2,−30 3,−20 4,−15 5,−12 Break up the middle term into a sum of like terms using our circled pair. 3x(10x2 − 7x− 6) = 3x(10x2 + 5x− 12x− 18) −7x = 5x− 12x. = 3x [ 5x(2x+ 1)− 6(2x+ 1)] Factor by grouping. = 3x(5x− 6)(2x+ 1) Factor out a 2x+ 1. Hence, 30x3 − 21x2 − 18x = 3x(5x− 6)(2x+ 1). 6.4. FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A != 1 431 Check: First, use the FOIL shortcut to multiply the two binomial factors, then distribute the monomial factor. 3x(5x− 6)(2x+ 1) = 3x(10x2 − 7x− 6) Apply the FOIL shortcut. = 30x3 − 21x2 − 18x Distribute the 3x. Because this is the original polynomial, the solution checks.

Solution: Because there is a power of x larger than one, the equation is nonlinear. Make one side equal to zero. 2x2 = 13x− 20 Original equation. 2x2 − 13x+ 20 = 0 Make one side zero. Compare 2x2 − 13x+ 20 with ax2 + bx+ c and note that a = 2, b = −13 and c = 20. We need an integer pair whose product is ac = 40 and whose sum is b = −13. The integer pair −5 and −8 comes to mind. Write the middle term as a sum of like terms using this pair. 2x2 − 5x− 8x+ 20 = 0 −13x = −5x− 8x. x(2x− 5)− 4(2x− 5) = 0 Factor by grouping. (x− 4)(2x− 5) = 0 Factor out 2x− 5. We have a product that equals zero. Use the zero product property to complete the solution. x− 4 = 0 or 2x− 5 = 0 x = 4 2x = 5 x = 5 2 Thus, the solutions of 2x2 = 13x− 20 are x = 4 and x = 5/2.

Solution: Because there is a power of x larger than one, the equation is nonlinear. Make one side equal to zero. 2x3 + x2 = 28x Original equation. 2x3 + x2 − 28x = 0 Make one side zero. Note that the GCF of 2x3, x2, and 28x is x. Factor out x. x(2x2 + x− 28) = 0 Factor out the GCF. Compare 2x2+x−28 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 2, b = 1 and c = −28. We need an integer pair whose product is ac = −56 and whose sum is b = 1. The integer pair −7 and 8 comes to mind. Write the middle term as a sum of like terms using this pair. x(2x2 − 7x+ 8x− 28) = 0 x = −7x+ 8x. x [ x(2x− 7) + 4(2x− 7)] = 0 Factor by grouping. x(x + 4)(2x− 7) = 0 Factor out 2x− 7.

FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A != 1 435 Thus, the solutions of 2x3 + x2 = 28x are x = 0, x = −4, and x = 7/2. Graphical solution. Rather than working with 2x3+x2 = 28x, graphing each side separately and finding where the graphs intersect, we will work instead with 2x3 + x2 − 28x = 0, locating where the graph of y = 2x3 + x2 − 28x crosses the x-axis.

In the image at the right in Figure 6.22, we saw the graph rise from the bottom of the screen, leave the top of the screen, return and leave via the bottom of the screen, and then finally return and leave via the top of the screen. Clearly, there are at least two turning points to the graph that are not visible in the current viewing window. Set the WINDOW settings as shown in the image on the left in Figure 6.23, then push the GRAPH button to produce the image on the right in Figure 6.23. Note that this window now shows the x-intercepts as well as the turning points of the graph of the polynomial. Figure 6.23: Adjusting the view so that the turning points of the polynomial are visible. To find the solutions of 2x3 + x2 − 28x = 0, we must identify the x-intercepts of the graph in Figure 6.23.

Press ENTER to mark the “Left bound,” then move the cursor to the right of the x-intercept and press ENTER to mark the “Right bound.” Finally, press ENTER to use the current position of the cursor for your “Guess.” The result is shown in the first image on the left in Figure 6.24.
