The word “arithmetic” is derived from the Greek word arithmos (translated as “number”). It is the oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics and is used for a variety of tasks ranging from simple counting to advanced science and business calculations. 1 2 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS  || 1.1 An Introduction to the Integers We begin with the set of counting numbers, formally called the set of natural numbers. The Natural Numbers. The set N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .} is called the set of natural numbers. If we add the number zero to the set of natural numbers, then we have a set of numbers that are called the whole numbers. The Whole Numbers. The set W = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .} is called the set of whole numbers. The number 0 is special, in that whenever you add it to another whole number, you get the identical number as an answer. Additive Identity Property. If a is any whole number, then a+ 0 = a. For this reason, the whole number 0 is called the additive identity. Thus, for example, 3 + 0 = 3, 15 + 0 = 15, and 123 + 0 = 123. These are all examples of the additive identity property. Every natural number has an opposite, so that when you add them together, their sum is zero. Additive Inverse Property. If a is any natural number, then define the opposite of a, symbolized by −a, so that a+ (−a) = 0. The number −a is called the “opposite of a,” or more formally, the additive inverse of a. For example, the opposite (additive inverse) of 3 is −3, and 3+ (−3) = 0. The opposite (additive inverse) of 12 is −12, and 12 + (−12) = 0. The opposite of 1.1. AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INTEGERS 3 254 is −254, and 254+(−254) = 0. These are all examples of additive inverses and the additive inverse property. Because 7+ (−7) = 0, we’ve said that −7 is the opposite (additive inverse) of 7. However, we can also turn that around and say that 7 is the opposite of −7. If we translate the phrase “the opposite of −7 is 7” into mathematical symbols, we get −(−7) = 7. The opposite of the opposite. Because a+ (−a) = 0, we can say that a is the opposite of −a. In symbols, we write: −(−a) = a Thus, for example, −(−11) = 11, −(−103) = 103, and −(−1255) = 1255.  || The Integers If we collect all the natural numbers and their additive inverses, then include the number zero, we have a collection of numbers called the integers. The Integers. The set Z = {. . . ,−5,−4,−3,−2,−1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .} is called the set of integers. The integers can be made to correspond to points on a line in a very natural manner. First, draw a line, then locate the number zero anywhere you wish. Secondly, place the number one to the right of zero. This determines the length of one unit. Finally, locate the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . to the right of zero, then their opposites (additive inverses) −1, −2, −3, −4, −5, . . . to the left of zero (see Figure 1.1). −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Figure 1.1: Each integer corresponds to a unique position on the number line. Note that as we move to the right on the number line, the integers get larger. On the other hand, as we move to the left on the number line, the integers get smaller. Positive and negative integers. On the number line, some integers lie to the right of zero and some lie to the left of zero. 4 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS • If a is an integer that lies to the right of zero, then a is called a positive integer. • If a is an integer that lies to the left of zero, then a is called a negative integer. Thus, 4, 25, and 142 are positive integers, while−7, −53, and−435 are negative integers.  || Absolute Value The absolute value (or magnitude) of an integer is defined as follows. The Absolute Value of an Integer. If a is an integer, then the absolute value of a, written |a|, is defined as the distance between the integer and zero on the number line. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify |− 4|.Simplify: |− 23| Solution: Consider the position of −4 on the number line. Note that −4 lies four units away from zero. −7 −6 −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 units Because the absolute value (magnitude) of an integer equals its distance from zero, |− 4| = 4.Answer: |− 23| = 23 ! In similar fashion: • The integer 5 lies five units away from zero. Hence, |5| = 5. • The integer 0 lies zero units away from zero, Hence, |0| = 0. Note that the absolute value of any number is either positive or zero. That is, the absolute value of a number is nonnegative (not negative). 1.1. AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INTEGERS 5  || Integer Addition This section is designed to provide a quick review of integer addition. For a more thorough introduction to integer addition, read section two of chapter two of our prealgebra textbook, provided online at the following URL: http://msenux.redwoods.edu/PreAlgText/contents/chapter2/ chapter2.pdf We consider the first of two cases. Adding Integers with Like Signs. To add two integers with like signs (both positive or both negative), add their magnitudes (absolute values), then prefix their common sign. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Simplify 7 + 12. Simplify: 13 + 28 Solution: We have like signs. The magnitudes (absolute values) of 7 and 12 are 7 and 12, respectively. If we add the magnitudes, we get 19. If we prefix the common sign, we get 19. That is: 7 + 12 = 19 Answer: 41 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify −8 + (−9). Simplify: −12 + (−21) Solution: We have like signs. The magnitudes (absolute values) of −8 and −9 are 8 and 9, respectively. If we add the magnitudes, we get 17. If we prefix the common sign, we get −17. That is: −8 + (−9) = −17 Answer: −33 ! Next, we consider the case where we have unlike signs. Adding Integers with Unlike Signs. To add two integers with unlike signs (one positive and one negative), subtract the integer with the smaller magnitude (absolute value) from the number with the larger magnitude, then prefix the sign of the integer with the larger magnitude. 6 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify −14 + 11.Simplify: 12 + (−29) Solution: We have unlike signs. The magnitudes (absolute values) of −14 and 11 are 14 and 11, respectively. If we subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger, we get 3. The number −14 has the larger magnitude, so we prefix our answer with its negative sign. That is: −14 + 11 = −3Answer: −17 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify 40 + (−25).Simplify: 32 + (−90) Solution: We have unlike signs. The magnitudes (absolute values) of 40 and −25 are 40 and 25, respectively. If we subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger, we get 15. The number 40 has the larger magnitude, so we prefix our answer with its positive sign. That is: 40 + (−25) = 15Answer: −58 !  || Mathematical Properties of Addition The order in which we add integers does not matter. That is, −20 + 34 gives an answer identical to the sum 34 + (−20). In both cases, the answer is 14. This fact is called the commutative property of addition. The Commutative Property of Addition. If a and b are any two integers, then: a+ b = b+ a Next, when we add three integers, it does not matter which two we add first. For example, if we add the second and third of three numbers first, we get: −11 + (−2 + 5) = −11 + 3 Parentheses first: −2 + 5 = 3 = −8 Add: −11 + 3 = −8 1.1. AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INTEGERS 7 On the other hand, if we add the first and second of three numbers first, we get: (−11 + (−2)) + 5 = −13 + 5 Parentheses first: −11 + (−2) = −13 = −8 Add: −13 + 5 = −8 Thus, −11 + (−2 + 5) = (−11 + (−2)) + 5. This fact is called the associative property of addition. The Associative Property of Addition. If a, b, and c are any three integers, then: a+ (b+ c) = (a+ b) + c  || Integer Subtraction Subtraction is the inverse, or the opposite, of addition. Subtracting Integers. If a and b are any two integers, then: a− b = a+ (−b) Subtracting b is identical to adding the opposite (additive inverse) of b. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Simplify: −13− 27 Simplify: −11− 15 Solution: The “opposite” (additive inverse) of 27 is −27. So, subtracting 27 is the same as adding −27. −13− 27 = −13 + (−27) Subtracting 27 is the same as adding −27. = −50 Add the magnitudes, then prefix the common negative sign. Answer: −26 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Simplify: −27− (−50) Simplify: −18− (−54) 8 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Solution: The “opposite” (additive inverse) of −50 is −(−50), or 50. So, subtracting −50 is the same as adding 50. −27− (−50) = −27 + 50 Subtracting −50 is the same as adding 50. = 23 Subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger magnitude, then prefix the sign of the larger magnitude.Answer: 36 !  || Integer Multiplication This section is designed to provide a quick review of multiplication and division of integers.

EXAMPLE 8. Simplify each of the following expressions:Simplify: (−18)(−5) (a) (2)(3) (b) (−12)(−8) (c) −14/(−2) Solution: When multiplying or dividing, like signs yield a positive result. (a) (2)(3) = 6 (b) (−12)(−8) = 96 (c) −14/(−2) = 7Answer: 90 ! Unlike Signs. If a and b are integers with unlike signs (one positive and one negative), then the product ab and the quotient a/b are negative. (+)(−) = − or (+)/(−) = − (−)(+) = − or (−)/(+) = − 1.1. AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INTEGERS 9 You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Simplify each of the following expressions: Simplify: (−19)(3) (a) (2)(−12) (b) (−9)(12) (c) 24/(−8) Solution: When multiplying or dividing, unlike signs yield a negative result. (a) (2)(−12) = −24 (b) (−9)(12) = −108 (c) 24/(−8) = −3 Answer: −57 !  || Mathematical Properties of Multiplication The order in which we multiply integers does not matter. That is, (−8)(5) gives an answer identical to (5)(−8). In both cases, the answer is −40. This fact is called the commutative property of multiplication. The Commutative Property of Multiplication. If a and b are any two integers, then: a · b = b · a Next, when we multiply three integers, it does not matter which two we multiply first. If we multiply the second and third of three numbers first, we get: (−3)[ (−4)(−5) ] = (−3)(20) Brackets first: (−4)(−5) = 20 = −60 Multiply: (−3)(20) = −60 On the other hand, if we multiply the first and second of three numbers first, we get:[ (−3)(−4) ](−5) = (12)(−5) Brackets first: (−3)(−4) = 12 = −60 Multiply: (12)(−5) = −60 Thus, (−3)[(−4)(−5)] = [(−3)(−4)](−5). This fact is called the associative property of multiplication. The Associative Property of Multiplication. If a, b, and c are any three integers, then: a · (b · c) = (a · b) · c When you multiply an integer by 1, you get the identical number back as the product. For example, (1)(5) = 5 and (−11)(1) = −11. This fact is known as the multiplicative identity property. 10 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS The Multiplicative Identity Property. If a is any integer, then: 1 · a = a and a · 1 = a For this reason, the integer 1 is called the “multiplicative identity.” Finally, note that (−1)(5) = −5. Thus, multiplying 5 by −1 is identical to taking the “opposite” of 5 or negating 5. The Multiplicative Property of −1. Multiplying by minus one is identical to negating. That is: (−1)a = −a  || Exponents In the exponential expression an, the number a is called the base, while the number n is called the exponent. We now define what is meant by an exponent. Exponents. Let a be an integer and let n be any whole number. If n != 0, then: an = a · a · a · · · · · a︸ ︷︷ ︸ n times That is, to calculate an, write a as a factor n times. You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Simplify (−2)3.Simplify: (−2)2 Solution: In the exponential expression (−2)3, note that −2 is the base, while 3 is the exponent. The exponent tells us to write the base as a factor three times. Simplify the result by performing the multiplications in order, moving from left to right. (−2)3 = (−2)(−2)(−2) −2 as a factor, three times. = (4)(−2) Multiply: (−2)(−2) = 4. = −8 Multiply: (4)(−2) = −8. Thus, (−2)3 = −8.Answer: 4 ! In Example 10, note that the product of three negative factors is negative. Let’s try another example. 1.1. AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INTEGERS 11 You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Simplify (−2)4. Simplify: (−2)5 Solution: In the exponential expression (−2)4, note that −2 is the base, while 4 is the exponent. The exponent tells us to write the base as a factor four times. Simplify the result by performing the multiplications in order, moving from left to right. (−2)4 = (−2)(−2)(−2)(−2) −2 as a factor, four times. = (4)(−2)(−2) Multiply: (−2)(−2) = 4. = (−8)(−2) Multiply: (4)(−2) = −8. = 16 Multiply: (−8)(−2) = 16. Thus, (−2)4 = 16. Answer: −32 ! In Example 11, note that the product of four negative factors is positive. Examples 10 and 11 reveal the following pattern. Odd or Even Exponents. 1. When a negative integer is raised to an even exponent, the result is positive. 2. When a negative integer is raised to an odd exponent, the result is neg- ative.  || Graphing Calculator: Negating versus Subtracting Consider the view of the lower half of the TI84 graphing calculator in Figure 1.2. Figure 1.2: Lower half of the TI-84. Note that there are two keys that contain some sort of negative sign, one on the bottom row of keys, and another in the last column of keys on the right, positioned just above the plus symbol. (-) and − The first of these buttons is the unary “negation” operator. If you want to negate a single (thus the word “unary”) number, then this is the key to use. For example, enter -3 by pressing the following button sequence. The result is shown in Figure 1.3. (-) 3 ENTER 12 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS The second button is the binary “subtraction” operator. If you want to subtract one number from another number (thus the word “binary”), then this is the key to use.

If we perform the addition first, then we get −16 as a result (the question mark over the equal sign indicates that the result is questionable). −4 + 2 · 8 ?= −2 · 8 ? = −16. On the other hand, if we perform the multiplication first, then we get 12 as a result. −4 + 2 · 8 ?= −4 + 16 ? = 12. So, what are we to do?

Answer: −14 !  || Evaluating Algebraic Expressions Variable. A variable is a symbol (usually a letter) that stands for an unknown value that may vary. Let’s add the definition of an algebraic expression. Algebraic Expression. When we combine numbers and variables in a valid way, using operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, the resulting combination of mathematical symbols is called an algebraic expression. Thus, 2a, x+ 5, and y2, being formed by a combination of numbers, variables, and mathematical oper- ators, are valid algebraic expressions. An algebraic expression must be well-formed. For example, 2 +−5x is not a valid expression because there is no term following the plus sign (it is not valid to write +− with nothing between these operators). Similarly, 2 + 3(2 is not well-formed because parentheses are not balanced. In this section we will evaluate algebraic expressions for given values of the variables contained in the expressions.

The first difficulty with this expression is the fact that the graphing calculator does not have a bracket symbol for the purposes of grouping. The calculator has only parentheses for grouping. So we first convert our expression to the following: −213− 35(−18− 211(15− 223)) Note that brackets and parentheses are completely interchangeable. The next difficulty is determining which of the minus signs are negation symbols and which are subtraction symbols. If the minus sign does not appear between two numbers, it is a negation symbol. If the minus sign does appear between two numbers, it is a subtraction symbol. Hence, we enter the following keystrokes on our calculator. The result is shown in Figure 1.8.

Let’s slow down and apply the Rules Guiding Order of Operations to the expression 5+5/5+5. 5 + 5/5 + 5 = 5 + 5 5 + 5 Divide first. = 5 + 1 + 5 Divide: 5 5 = 1. = 11 Add: 5 + 1 + 5 = 11. Aha! That’s how the calculator got 11. 5 + 5/5 + 5 is equivalent to 5 + 5 5 + 5 Let’s change the order of evaluation by using grouping symbols. Note that: (5 + 5)/(5 + 5) = 10/10 Parentheses first. = 1 Divide: 10/10 = 1. That is: (5 + 5)/(5 + 5) is equivalent to 5 + 5 5 + 5 Enter (5+5)(5+5) and press the ENTER key to produce the output shown in the second image in Figure 1.9. Figure 1.9: Calculating 5 + 5 5 + 5 . Answer: 1 ! 26 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS The graphing calculator has memory locations available for “storing” values. They are lettered A-Z and appear on the calculator case, in alphabetic order as you move from left to right and down the keyboard. Storing values in these memory locations is an efficient way to evaluate algebraic expressions containing variables. Use the ALPHA key to access these memory locations. You Try It! EXAMPLE 12. Use the graphing calculator to evaluate |a|− |b| at a = −312Use the graphing calculator to evaluate |a− b| at a = −312 and b = −875. and b = −875. Solution. First store −312 in the variable A with the following keystrokes. To select the letter A, press the ALPHA key, then the MATH key, located in the upper left-hand corner of the calculator (see Figure 1.10). (-) 3 1 2 STO! ALPHA A ENTER Next, store −875 in the variable B with the following keystrokes. To select the letter B, press the ALPHA key, then the APPS key. Figure 1.10: Upper half of the TI84. (-) 8 7 5 STO! ALPHA B ENTER The results of these keystrokes are shown in the first image in Figure 1.11. Now we need to enter the expression |a|− |b|. The absolute value function is located in the MATH menu. When you press the MATH key, you’ll notice submenus MATH, NUM, CPX, and PRB across the top row of the MATH menu. Use the right-arrow key to select the NUM submenu (see the second image in Figure 1.11). Note that abs( is the first entry on this menu. This is the absolute value function needed for this example. Enter the expression abs(A)-abs(B) as shown in the third image in Figure 1.11. Use the ALPHA key as described above to enter the variables A and B and close the parentheses using the right parentheses key from the keyboard. Press the ENTER key to evaluate your expression. Figure 1.11: Evaluate |a|− |b| at a = −312 and b = −875. Thus, |a|− |b| = −563.Answer: 563 ! 1.2. ORDER OF OPERATIONS 27 ! ! !  || 1.3 The Rational Numbers We begin with the definition of a rational number. Rational Numbers. Any number that can be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers, q != 0, is called a rational number. The letter Q is used to represent the set of rational numbers. That is: Q = { p q : p and q are integers, q != 0 } Because −2/3, 4/5, and 123/(−12) have the form p/q, where p and q are integers, each is an example of a rational number. If you think you hear the word “fraction” when we say “rational number,” you are correct in your thinking. Any number that can be expressed as a fraction, where the numerator and denominator are integers, is a rational number. Every integer is also a rational number. Take, for example, the integer −12. There are a number of ways we can express −12 as a fraction with integer numerator and denominator, −12/1, 24/(−2), and −36/3 being a few.  || Reducing Fractions to Lowest Terms First, we define what is meant by the greatest common divisor of two integers. The Greatest Common Divisor. Given two integers a and b, the greatest common divisor of a and b is the largest integer that divides evenly (with no remainder) into both a and b. The notation GCD(a, b) is used to represent the greatest common divisor of a and b. For example, GCD(12, 18) = 6, GCD(32, 40) = 8, and GCD(18, 27) = 9. We can now state when a fraction is reduced to lowest terms. Lowest Terms. A fraction a/b is said to be reduced to lowest terms if and only if GCD(a, b) = 1. A common technique used to reduce a fraction to lowest terms is to divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Reduce 8/12 to lowest terms. Reduce: −48/60 32 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Solution: Note that GCD(8, 12) = 4. Divide both numerator and denomina- tor by 4. 8 12 = 8÷ 4 12÷ 4 Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(8, 12) = 4. = 2 3 Simplify numerator and denominator. Thus, 8/12 = 2/3.Answer: −4/5 ! Recall the definition of a prime number. Prime Number. A natural number greater than one is prime if and only if its only divisors are one and itself. For example, 7 is prime (its only divisors are 1 and 7), but 14 is not (its divisors are 1, 2, 7, and 14). In like fashion, 2, 3, and 5 are prime, but 6, 15, and 21 are not prime. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Reduce 10/40 to lowest terms.Reduce 18/24 to lowest terms. Solution: Note that GCD(10, 40) = 10. Divide numerator and denominator by 10. 10 40 = 10÷ 10 40÷ 10 Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(10, 40) = 10. = 1 4 Simplify numerator and denominator. Alternate solution: Use factor trees to express both numerator and denom- inator as a product of prime factors. 10 2 5 40 4 2 2 10 2 5 Hence, 10 = 2 · 5 and 40 = 2 · 2 · 2 · 5. Now, to reduce 10/40 to lowest terms, replace the numerator and denominator with their prime factorizations, then cancel factors that are in common to both numerator and denominator. 1.3. THE RATIONAL NUMBERS 33 10 40 = 2 · 5 2 · 2 · 2 · 5 Prime factor numerator and denominator. = ! 2 · !5 !2 · 2 · 2 · !5 Cancel common factors. = 1 4 Simplify numerator and denominator. When we cancel a 2 from both the numerator and denominator, we’re actually dividing both numerator and denominator by 2. A similar statement can be made about canceling the 5. Canceling both 2 and a 5 is equivalent to dividing both numerator and denominator by 10. This explains the 1 in the numerator when all factors cancel. Answer: 3/4 ! Example 2 demonstrates an important point. When all factors cancel. When all of the factors cancel in either numerator or denominator, the resulting numerator or denominator is equal to one.  || Multiplying Fractions First, the definition. Multiplication of Fractions. If a/b and c/d are two fractions, then their product is defined as follows: a b · c d = ac bd Thus, to find the product of a/b and c/d, simply multiply numerators and multiply denominators. For example: 1 2 · 3 4 = 3 8 and − 2 5 · 7 3 = −14 15 and − 5 8 · ( −1 6 ) = 5 48 Like integer multiplication, like signs yield a positive answer, unlike signs yield a negative answer. Of course, when necessary, remember to reduce your answer to lowest terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify: −14 20 · 10 21 Simplify: − 8 9 · ( −27 20 ) 34 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Solution: Multiply numerators and denominators, then reduce to lowest terms. −14 20 · 10 21 = −140 420 Multiply numerators and denominators. = − 2 · 2 · 5 · 7 2 · 2 · 3 · 5 · 7 Prime factor. = − !2 · !2 · !5 · !7 !2 · !2 · 3 · !5 · !7 Cancel common factors. = −1 3 Simplify. Note that when all the factors cancel from the numerator, you are left with a 1. Thus, (−14/20) · (10/21) = −1/3.Answer: 6/5 ! Cancellation Rule. When multiplying fractions, cancel common factors ac- cording to the following rule: “Cancel a factor in a numerator for an identical factor in a denominator.” The rule is “cancel something on the top for something on the bottom.” Thus, an alternate approach to multiplying fractions is to factor numerators and denominators in place, then cancel a factor in a numerator for an identical factor in a denominator. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify: 15 8 · ( −14 9 ) Simplify: − 6 45 · ( −35 14 ) Solution: Factor numerators and denominators in place, then cancel common factors in the numerators for common factors in the denominators. 15 8 · ( −14 9 ) = 3 · 5 2 · 2 · 2 · ( −2 · 7 3 · 3 ) Factor numerators and denominators. = ! 3 · 5 !2 · 2 · 2 · ( −!2 · 7 !3 · 3 ) Cancel a factor in a numerator for a common. factor in a denominator. = −35 12 Multiply numerators and. denominators. Note that unlike signs yield a negative product. Thus, (15/8) · (−14/9) = −35/12.Answer: 1/3 ! 1.3. THE RATIONAL NUMBERS 35  || Dividing Fractions Every nonzero rational number has was it called a multiplicative inverse or reciprocal. The Reciprocal. If a is any nonzero rational number, then 1/a is called the multiplicative inverse or reciprocal of a, and: a · 1 a = 1 Note that: 2 · 1 2 = 1 and 3 5 · 5 3 = 1 and − 4 7 · ( −7 4 ) = 1. Thus, the reciprocal of 2 is 1/2, the reciprocal of 3/5 is 5/3, and the reciprocal of −4/7 is −7/4. Note that to find the reciprocal of a number, simply invert the number (flip it upside down). Now we can define the quotient of two fractions. Division of Fractions. If a/b and c/d are two fractions, then their quotient is defined as follows: a b ÷ c d = a b · d c That is, dividing by c/d is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal d/c. The above definition of division is summarized by the phrase “invert and mul- tiply.” You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify: −35 21 ÷ ( −10 12 ) Simplify: −4 9 ÷ 27 81 Solution: Invert and multiply, then factor in place and cancel common factors in a numerator for common factors in a denominator. −35 21 ÷ ( −10 12 ) = −35 21 · ( −12 10 ) Invert and multiply. = −5 · 7 3 · 7 · ( −2 · 2 · 3 2 · 5 ) Prime factor. = −!5 · !7 !3 · !7 · ( −!2 · 2 · !3 !2 · !5 ) Cancel common factors. = 2 1 Multiply numerators and denominators. = 2 Simplify. 36 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Note that when all the factors in a denominator cancel, a 1 remains. Thus, (−35/21)÷ (−10/12) = 2. Note also that like signs yield a positive result.Answer: −4/3 !  || Adding Fractions First the definition. Addition of Fractions. If two fractions have a denominator in common, add the numerators and place the result over the common denominator. In symbols: a c + b c = a+ b c For example: −3 5 + 7 5 = 4 5 and − 4 3 + ( −7 3 ) = −11 3 and 4 7 + ( −5 7 ) = −1 7 If the fractions do not posses a common denominator, first create equivalent fractions with a least common denominator, then add according to the rule above. Least Common Denominator. If the fractions a/b and c/d do not share a common denominator, the least common denominator for b and d, written LCD(b, d), is defined as the smallest number divisible by both b and d. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Simplify: −3 8 + 5 12Simplify: − 5 6 + 1 9 Solution: The least common denominator in this case is the smallest number divisible by both 8 and 12. In this case, LCD(8, 12) = 24. We first need to make equivalent fractions with a common denominator of 24. −3 8 + 5 12 = −3 8 · 3 3 + 5 12 · 2 2 Make equivalent fraction with a common denominator of 24. = − 9 24 + 10 24 Multiply numerators and denominators. = 1 24 Add: −9 + 10 = 1. Note how we add the numerators in the last step, placing the result over the common denominator. Thus, −3/8 + 5/12 = 1/24.Answer: −13/18 ! 1.3.

If grouping symbols are nested, evaluate the expression in the innermost pair of grouping symbols first. 2. Evaluate all exponents that appear in the expression. 3.

However, the calculator gives accurate results for operations involving frac- tions, as long as we don’t use fractions with denominators that are too large for the calculator to respond with an exact answer. 40 CHAPTER 1.

THE RATIONAL NUMBERS 43 ! ! !  || 1.4 Decimal Notation Every rational number can be expressed using decimal notation. To change a fraction into its decimal equivalent, divide the numerator of the fraction by its denominator. In some cases the process will terminate, leaving a zero remain- der. However, in other cases, the remainders will begin to repeat, providing a decimal representation that repeats itself in blocks. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Change each of the following fractions into decimals.Change 24/7 to a decimal. (a) 39 80 (b) 4 11 Solution: We perform two divisions, the one on the left to change 39/80 to a decimal, the one on the right to find a decimal representation for 4/11. 0.4875 80)39.0000 32 0 7 00 6 40 600 560 400 400 0 0.3636 11)4.0000 3 3 70 66 40 33 70 66 4 On the left, the division process terminates with a zero remainder. Hence, 39/80 = 0.4875 is called a terminating decimal. On the right, the remainders repeat in a pattern and the quotient also repeats in blocks of two. Hence, 4/11 = 0.3636 . . . is called a repeating decimal. We can also use a repeating bar to write 4/11 = 0.36. The block under the repeating bar repeats itself indefinitely.Answer: 3.428571 ! Vice-versa, any terminating decimal can be expressed as a fraction. You need only count the number of digits after the decimal point and use the same number of zeros in your denominator. You Try It!

(a) 0.055 (b) 3.36 Solution: In each case, count the number of digits after the decimal point and include an equal number of zeros in the denominator. 1.4. DECIMAL NOTATION 49 In example (a), there are three dig- its after the decimal point, so we place the number over 1000, which has three zeros after the one. 0.055 = 55 1000 = 11 200 In example (b), there are two digits after the decimal point, so we place the number over 100, which has two zeros after the one. 3.36 = 336 100 = 84 25 Answer: 9/20 ! As we saw in Example 1, the repeating decimal 0.36 is equivalent to the fraction 4/11. Indeed, any repeating decimal can be written as a fraction. For example, 0.3 = 1/3 and 0.142857 = 1/7. In future courses you will learn a technique for changing any repeating decimal into an equivalent fraction. However, not all decimals terminate or repeat. For example, consider the decimal 0.42422422242222..., which neither terminates nor repeats. This number cannot be expressed using repeating bar notation because each iteration generates one additional 2. Be- cause this number neither repeats nor terminates, it cannot be expressed as a fraction. Hence, 0.42422422242222... is an example of an irrational number. Irrational numbers. If a number cannot be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers, q != 0, then the number is called an irrational number. Real numbers. By including all of the rational and irrational numbers in one set, we form what is known as the set of real numbers. The set of real numbers includes every single number we will use in this text- book and course.  || Adding and Subtracting Decimals When adding signed decimals, use the same rules you learned to use when adding signed integers or fractions. Sign rules for addition. When adding two decimal numbers, use the follow- ing rules: • To add two decimals with like signs, add their magnitudes and prefix their common sign. 50 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS • To add two decimals with unlike signs, subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger, then prefix the sign of the decimal number having the larger magnitude. You Try It!

Then we note that we have unlike signs. Thus, we first subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger magnitude, then prefix the sign of the decimal number with the larger magnitude. −7.9− (−5.32) = −7.9 + 5.32 = −2.58 7.90 −5.32 2.58 Hence, −5.6− 8.4 = −14.0 and −7.9− (−5.32) = −2.58.Answer: −41.07 ! 1.4.

Sign Rules for multiplication and division. When multiplying or dividing two decimal numbers, use the following rules: • Like signs give a positive result. • Unlike signs give a negative result. Multiplication of decimal numbers is fairly straightforward. First multiply the magnitudes of the numbers, ignoring the decimal points, then count the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in each factor. Place the decimal point in the product so that the number of digits to the right of the decimal points equals the sum of number of digits to the right of the decimal point in each factor. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify: (−1.96)(2.8) Simplify: (−12.5)(−23.4) Solution: Multiply the magnitudes. The first decimal number has two digits to the right of the decimal point, the second has one digit to the right of the decimal point. Thus, we must place a total of three digits to the right of the decimal point in the product. (−1.96)(2.8) = −5.488 1.96 ×2.8 1 568 3 92 5.488 Note that unlike signs yield a negative product.

THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS One approach is to change 2/5 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator. Thus, 2/5 = 0.4. = −3.2(0.4) + 5 Replace 2/5 with 0.4. = −1.28 + 5 Multiply: −3.2(0.4) = −1.28. = 3.72 Add: −1.28 + 5 = 3.72. Thus, if x = 2/5, then −3.2x+ 5 = 3.72.Answer: 8.725 ! As we saw in Example 2, we can easily change a terminating decimal into a fraction by placing the number (without the decimal point) over the proper power of ten. The choice of the power of ten should match the number of digits to the right of the decimal point. For example: 0.411 = 411 1000 and 3.11 = 311 100 and 15.1111 = 151111 10000 Note that the number of zeros in each denominator matches the number of digits to the right of the decimal point.

DECIMAL NOTATION 55  || Rounding Using the Graphing Calculator Here is the algorithm for rounding a decimal number to a particular place. Rules for rounding. To round a number to a particular place, follow these steps: 1. Mark the place you wish to round to. The digit in this place is called the rounding digit. 2. Mark the digit in the place to the immediate right of the rounding digit. This is called the test digit. a) If the test digit is greater than or equal to 5, add 1 to the rounding digit, then replace all digits to the right of the rounding digit with zeros. Trailing zeros to the right of the decimal point may be deleted. b) If the test digit is less than 5, keep the rounding digit the same, then replace all digits to the right of the rounding digit with zeros. Trailing zeros to the right of the decimal point may be deleted. You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Use your graphing calculator to evaluate 125x3−17.5x+44.8 at x = −3.13. Round your answer to the nearest tenth. Evaluate x3 − 3x at x = −1.012. Round to the nearest hundredth. Solution. First, store −3.13 in the variable X with the following keystrokes. (-) 3 . 1 3 STO! X,T,θ,n ENTER The result is shown in the first image in Figure 1.15. Next, enter the expression 125x3 − 17.5x+ 44.8 with the following keystrokes. (-) 1 2 5 × X,T,θ,n ∧ 3 − 1 7 . 5 × X,T,θ,n + 4 4 . 8 ENTER The result is shown in the second image in Figure 1.15. Thus, the answer is approximately −3733.462125. We now need to round this answer to the nearest tenth. Mark the rounding digit in the tenths place and the test digit to its immediate right. −3733. 4 6 2125 Rounding digit Test digit 56 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Figure 1.15: Evaluate 125x3 − 17.5x+ 44.8 at x = −3.13. Because the test digit is greater than or equal to 5, add 1 to the rounding digit, then replace all digits to the right of the rounding digit with zeros. −3733.462125≈ −3733.500000 Delete the trailing zeros from end of the fractional part of a decimal. This does not change our answer’s value. −3733.462125≈ −3733.5 Therefore, if x = −3.13. then to the nearest tenth: 125x3 − 17.5x+ 44.8 ≈ −3733.5 Answer: 2.0 ! 1.4. DECIMAL NOTATION 57 ! ! !  || 1.5 Algebraic Expressions The associative property of multiplication is valid for all numbers. Associative Property of Multiplication. Let a, b, and c be any numbers. Then: a · (b · c) = (a · b) · c The associative property of multiplication is useful in a number of situations. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify: −3(4y)Simplify: 2(3x) Solution: Currently, the grouping −3(4y) demands that we first multiply 4 and y. However, we can use the associative property of multiplication to regroup, first multiplying −3 and 4. −3(4y) = (−3 · 4)y The associative property of multiplication. = −12y Multiply: −3 · 4 = −12 Thus, −3(4y) = −12y.Answer: 6x ! Let’s look at another example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Simplify: −2(−4xy)Simplify: −3(−8u2) Solution: Currently, the grouping −2(−4xy) demands that we first multiply −4 and xy. However, we can use the associative property of multiplication to regroup, first multiplying −2 and −4. −2(−4xy) = (−2 · (−4))xy The associative property of multiplication. = 8xy Multiply: −2 · (−4) = 8 Thus, −2(−4xy) = 8xy.Answer: 24u2 ! In practice, we can move quicker if we perform the regrouping mentally, then simply write down the answer. For example: −2(−4t) = 8t and 2(−5z2) = −10z2 and − 3(4u3) = −12u3 1.5. ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 61  || The Distributive Property We now discuss a property that couples addition and multiplication. Consider the expression 2 · (3+ 5). The Rules Guiding Order of Operations require that we first simplify the expression inside the parentheses. 2 · (3 + 5) = 2 · 8 Add: 3 + 5 = 8 = 16 Multiply: 2 · 8 = 16 Alternatively, we can instead distribute the 2 times each term in the parenthe- ses. That is, we will first multiply the 3 by 2, then multiply the 5 by 2. Then we add the results. 2 · (3 + 5) = 2 · 3 + 2 · 5 Distribute the 2. = 6 + 10 Multiply: 2 · 3 = 6 and 2 · 5 = 10 = 16 Add: 6 + 10 = 16 Note that both methods produce the same result, namely 16. This example demonstrates an extremely important property of numbers called the distribu- tive property. The Distributive Property. Let a, b, and c be any numbers. Then: a · (b+ c) = a · b+ a · c That is, multiplication is distributive with respect to addition. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Use the distributive property to expand 2(3x+ 7). Expand: 5(2y + 7) Solution: First distribute the 2 times each term in the parentheses. Then simplify. 2(3x+ 7) = 2(3x) + 2(7) Use the distributive property. = 6x+ 14 Multiply: 2(3x) = 6x and 2(7) = 14 Thus, 2(3x+ 7) = 6x+ 14. Answer: 10y + 35 ! Multiplication is also distributive with respect to subtraction. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Use the distributive property to expand −2(5y − 6). Expand: −3(2z − 7) 62 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Solution: Change to addition by adding the opposite, then apply the dis- tributive property. −2(5y − 6) = −2(5y + (−6)) Add the opposite. = −2(5y) + (−2)(−6) Use the distributive property. = −10y + 12 Multiply: −2(5y) = −10y and (−2)(−6) = 12 Thus, −2(5y − 6) = −10y + 12.Answer: −6z + 21 !  || Speeding Things Up a Bit In Example 4, we changed the subtraction to addition, applied the distributiveSome might prefer to “take their time,” using the technique shown in Examples 3 and 4 until they feel “ready” to move more quickly. property, then several steps later we were finished. However, if you understand that subtraction is really the same as adding the opposite, and if you are willing to do a few steps in your head, you should be able to simply write down the answer immediately following the given problem. If you look at the expression −2(5y − 6) from Example 4 again, only this time think “multiply −2 times 5y, then multiply −2 times −6, then the result is immediate. −2(5y − 6) = −10y + 12 Let’s try this “speeding it up” technique in a couple more examples. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Use the distributive property to expand −3(−2x+ 5y − 12).Expand: −3(−2a+ 3b− 7) Solution: To distribute the −3, we simply think as follows: “−3(−2x) = 6x, −3(5y) = −15y, and −3(−12) = 36.” This sort of thinking allows us to write down the answer immediately without any additional steps. −3(−2x+ 5y − 12) = 6x− 15y + 36 Answer: 6a− 9b+ 21 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Use the distributive property to expand −5(−2a− 5b+ 8).Expand: −4(−x− 2y − 7) Solution: To distribute the −5, we simply think as follows: “−5(−2a) = 10a, −5(−5b) = 25b, and −5(8) = −40.” This sort of thinking allows us to write down the answer immediately without any additional steps. −5(−2a− 5b+ 8) = 10a+ 25b− 40 Answer: 4x+ 8y + 28 ! 1.5. ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 63  || Distributing a Negative Sign Recall that negating a number is equivalent to multiplying the number by −1. Multiplicative Property of Minus One. If a is any number, then: (−1)a = −a This means that if we negate an expression, it is equivalent to multiplying the expression by −1. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Expand −(7x− 8y − 10). Expand: −(−a− 2b+ 11) Solution: First, negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. Then we can change subtraction to addition by “adding the opposite” and use the distribu- tive property to finish the expansion. −(7x− 8y − 10) = −1(7x− 8y − 10) Negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1 = −1(7x+ (−8y) + (−10)) Add the opposite. = −1(7x) + (−1)(−8y) + (−1)(−10) Distribute the −1. = −7x+ 8y + 10 Multiply. Thus, −(7x− 8y − 10) = −7x+ 8y + 10. Answer: a+ 2b− 11 ! While being mathematically precise, the technique of Example 7 can be simpli- fied by noting that negating an expression surrounded by parentheses simply changes the sign of each term inside the parentheses to the opposite sign. Once we understand this, we can simply “distribute the minus sign” and write: −(7x− 8y − 10) = −7x+ 8y + 10 In similar fashion, −(−3a+ 5b− c) = 3a− 5b+ c and −(−3x− 8y + 11) = 3x+ 8y − 11. 64 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS  || Combining Like Terms We can use the distributive property to distribute a number times a sum. a(b+ c) = ab+ ac However, the distributive property can also be used in reverse, to “unmultiply” or factor an expression. Thus, we can start with the expression ab + ac and “factor out” the common factor a as follows: ab+ ac = a(b+ c) You can also factor out the common factor on the right. ac+ bc = (a+ b)c We can use this latter technique to combine like terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Simplify: 7x+ 5xSimplify: 3y + 8y Solution: Use the distributive property to factor out the common factor x from each term, then simplify the result. 7x+ 5x = (7 + 5)x Factor out an x using the distributive property. = 12x Simplify: 7 + 5 = 12 Thus, 7x+ 5x = 12x.Answer: 11y ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Simplify: −8a2 + 5a2Simplify: −5z3 + 9z3 Solution: Use the distributive property to factor out the common factor a2 from each term, then simplify the result. −8a2 + 5a2 = (−8 + 5)a2 Factor out an a2 using the distributive property. = −3a2 Simplify: −8 + 5 = −3 Thus, −8a2 + 5a2 = −3a2.Answer: 4z3 ! Examples 8 and 9 combine what are known as “like terms.” Examples 8 and 9 also suggest a possible shortcut for combining like terms. 1.5. ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 65 Like Terms. Two terms are called like terms if they have identical variable parts, which means that the terms must contain the same variables raised to the same exponents. For example, 2x2y and 11x2y are like terms because they contain identical variables raised to the same exponents. On the other hand, −3st2 and 4s2t are not like terms. They contain the same variables, but the variables are not raised to the same exponents. Consider the like terms 2x2y and 11x2y. The numbers 2 and 11 are called the coefficients of the like terms. We can use the distributive property to combine these like terms as we did in Examples 8 and 9, factoring out the common factor x2y. 2x2y + 11x2y = (2 + 11)x2y = 13x2y However, a much quicker approach is simply to add the coefficients of the like terms, keeping the same variable part. That is, 2 + 11 = 13, so: 2x2y + 11x2y = 13x2y This is the procedure we will follow from now on. You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Simplify: −8w2 + 17w2 Simplify: 4ab− 15ab Solution: These are like terms. If we add the coefficients −8 and 17, we get 9. Thus: −8w2 + 17w2 = 9w2 Add the coefficients and repeat the variable part. Answer: −11ab ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Simplify: −4uv − 9uv Simplify: −3xy − 8xy Solution: These are like terms. If we add −4 and −9, we get −13. Thus: −4uv − 9uv = −13uv Add the coefficients and repeat the variable part. Answer: −11xy ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 12. Simplify: −3x2y + 2xy2 Simplify: 5ab+ 11bc 66 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Solution: These are not like terms. They do not have the same variable parts. They do have the same variables, but the variables are not raised to the same exponents. Consequently, this expression is already simplified as much as possible. −3x2y + 2xy2 Unlike terms. Already simplified. Answer: 5ab+ 11bc ! Sometimes we have more than just a single pair of like terms. In that case, we want to group together the like terms and combine them. You Try It! EXAMPLE 13. Simplify: −8u− 4v − 12u+ 9vSimplify: −3z2 + 4z − 8z2 − 9z Solution: Use the associative and commutative property of addition to change the order and regroup, then combine line terms. −8u− 4v − 12u+ 9v = (−8u− 12u) + (−4v + 9v) Reorder and regroup. = −20u+ 5v Combine like terms. Note that −8u− 12u = −20u and −4v + 9v = 5v. Alternate solution. You may skip the reordering and regrouping step if you wish, simply combining like terms mentally. That is, it is entirely possible to order your work as follows: −8u− 4v − 12u+ 9v = −20u+ 5v Combine like terms. Answer: −11z2 − 5z ! In Example 13, the “Alternate solution” allows us to move more quickly and will be the technique we follow from here on, grouping and combining terms mentally.  || Order of Operations Now that we know how to combine like terms, let’s tackle some more compli- cated expressions that require the Rules Guiding Order of Operations.
