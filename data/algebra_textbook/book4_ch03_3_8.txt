The Order of Operations Sometimes there are no grouping symbols indicating which operations to perform first. For example, suppose we wish to find the value of 3 + 5⋅2. We could do either of two things: Add 3 and 5, then multiply this sum by 2. Multiply 5 and 2, then add 3 to this product. We now have two values for one number. To determine the correct value, we must use the accepted order of operations. Order of Operations Perform all operations inside grouping symbols, beginning with the innermost set, in the order 2, 3, 4 described below, Perform all exponential and root operations. Perform all multiplications and divisions, moving left to right. Perform all additions and subtractions, moving left to right. Sample Set C Determine the value of each of the following.
