Perfect Square Trinomials Revisited Recall the squaring a binomial shortcut. Squaring a binomial. If a and b are any real numbers, then: (a± b)2 = a2 ± 2ab+ b2 That is, you square the first term, take the product of the first and second terms and double the result, then square the third term. Reminder examples: (x+ 3)2 = x2 + 2(x)(3) + 32 = x2 + 6x+ 9 (x− 8)2 = x2 − 2(x)(8) + 82 = x2 − 16x+ 64 Because factoring is “unmultiplying,” it is a simple matter to reverse the mul- tiplication process and factor these perfect square trinomials. x2 + 6x+ 9 = (x+ 3)2 x2 − 16x+ 64 = (x− 8)2 Note how in each case we simply take the square root of the first and last terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Factor each of the following trinomials: Factor: x2 + 30x+ 225 a) x2 − 12x+ 36 b) x2 + 10x+ 25 c) x2 − 34x+ 289 Solution: Whenever the first and last terms of a trinomial are perfect squares, we should suspect that we have a perfect square trinomial. a) The first and third terms of x2 − 12x+ 36 are perfect squares. Hence, we take their square roots and try: x2 − 12x+ 36 = (x− 6)2 Note that 2(x)(6) = 12x, which is the middle term on the left. The solution checks. b) The first and third terms of x2 + 10x+ 25 are perfect squares. Hence, we take their square roots and try: x2 + 10x+ 25 = (x+ 5)2 Note that 2(x)(5) = 10x, which is the middle term on the left. The solution checks. 562 CHAPTER 8. QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS c) The first and third terms of x2 − 34x+289 are perfect squares. Hence, we take their square roots and try: x2 − 34x+ 289 = (x− 17)2 Note that 2(x)(17) = 34x, which is the middle term on the left. The solution checks. Answer: (x+ 15)2 !
