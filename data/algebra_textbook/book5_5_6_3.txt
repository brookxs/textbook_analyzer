Multiplying Polynomials Now that we’ve learned how to take the product of two monomials or the product of a monomial and a polynomial, we can apply what we’ve learned to multiply two arbitrary polynomials. Before we begin with the examples, let’s revisit the distributive property. We know that 2 · (3 + 4) = 2 · 3 + 2 · 4. Both sides are equal to 14. We’re used to having the monomial factor on the left, but it can also appear on the right. (3 + 4) · 2 = 3 · 2 + 4 · 2 Again, both sides equal 14. So, whether the monomial appears on the left or right makes no difference; that is, a(b + c) = ab + ac and (b + c)a = ba + ca give the same result. In each case, you multiply a times both terms of b+ c. You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Multiply: (2x+ 5)(3x+ 2) Multiply: (3x+ 4)(5x+ 1) Solution: Note that (2x + 5)(3x + 2) has the form (b + c)a, where a is the binomial 3x+2. Because (b+ c)a = ba+ ca, we will multiply 3x+2 times both terms of 2x+ 5 in the following manner. (2x+ 5)(3x+ 2) = 2x(3x+ 2) + 5(3x+ 2) Now we distribute monomials times polynomials, then combine like terms. = 6x2 + 4x+ 15x+ 10 = 6x2 + 19x+ 10 Thus, (2x+ 5)(3x+ 2) = 6x2 + 19x+ 10. Answer: 15x2 + 23x+ 4 ! 360 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Multiply: (x+ 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7)Multiply: (z + 4)(z2 + 3z + 9) Solution: Note that (x+5)(x2 +2x+7) has the form (b+ c)a, where a is the trinomial x2 +2x+7. Because (b+ c)a = ba+ ca, we will multiply x2 +2x+7 times both terms of x+ 5 in the following manner. (x+ 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x(x2 + 2x+ 7) + 5(x2 + 2x+ 7) Now we distribute monomials times polynomials, then combine like terms. = x3 + 2x2 + 7x+ 5x2 + 10x+ 35 = x3 + 7x2 + 17x+ 35 Thus, (x+ 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x3 + 7x2 + 17x+ 35.Answer: z3 +7z2 +21z+36 !
