Order of Operations Rational numbers obey the same Rules Guiding Order of Operations as do the integers. Rules Guiding Order of Operations. When evaluating expressions, pro- ceed in the following order. 1. Evaluate expressions contained in grouping symbols first. If grouping symbols are nested, evaluate the expression in the innermost pair of grouping symbols first. 2. Evaluate all exponents that appear in the expression. 3. Perform all multiplications and divisions in the order that they appear in the expression, moving left to right. 4. Perform all additions and subtractions in the order that they appear in the expression, moving left to right. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Given x = 2/3, y = −3/5, and z = 10/9, evaluate xy + yz. Given a = −1/2, b = 2/3, and c = −3/4, evaluate the expression a+ bc and simplify the result.Solution: Following Tips for Evaluating Algebraic Expressions, first replace all occurrences of variables in the expression xy + yz with open parentheses.
