 || Equality Property of Division and Multiplication Recalling that the equal sign of an equation indicates that the number represented by the expression on the left side is the same as the number represented by the expression on the right side suggests the equality property of division and multiplication, which states: We can obtain an equivalent equation by dividing both sides of the equation by the same nonzero number, that is, if c  ≠  0,  then a  =  b is equivalent to . We can obtain an equivalent equation by multiplying both sides of the equation by the same nonzero number, that is, if c  ≠  0, then a  =  b is equivalent to a c = b c . We can use these results to isolate x, thus solving the equation for x . Example 5.12.  Solving a x = b for x Example 5.13.  Solving for x  || Solving a x = b and for x Example 5.14.  Method for Solving To solve a x = b for x , divide both sides of the equation by a . To solve for x , multiply both sides of the equation by a .  ||
