Positive Proper Fractions Positive Proper Fraction Fractions in which the whole number in the numerator is strictly less than the whole number in the denominator are called positive proper fractions. On the number line, proper fractions are located in the interval from 0 to 1. Positive proper fractions are always less than one. The closed circle at 0 indicates that 0 is included, while the open circle at 1 indicates that 1 is not included. Some examples of positive proper fractions are , , , and Note that 1 < 2, 3 < 5, 20 < 27, and 106 < 225.
