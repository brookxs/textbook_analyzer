Speeding Things Up a Bit In Example 4, we changed the subtraction to addition, applied the distributiveSome might prefer to “take their time,” using the technique shown in Examples 3 and 4 until they feel “ready” to move more quickly. property, then several steps later we were finished. However, if you understand that subtraction is really the same as adding the opposite, and if you are willing to do a few steps in your head, you should be able to simply write down the answer immediately following the given problem. If you look at the expression −2(5y − 6) from Example 4 again, only this time think “multiply −2 times 5y, then multiply −2 times −6, then the result is immediate. −2(5y − 6) = −10y + 12 Let’s try this “speeding it up” technique in a couple more examples. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Use the distributive property to expand −3(−2x+ 5y − 12).Expand: −3(−2a+ 3b− 7) Solution: To distribute the −3, we simply think as follows: “−3(−2x) = 6x, −3(5y) = −15y, and −3(−12) = 36.” This sort of thinking allows us to write down the answer immediately without any additional steps. −3(−2x+ 5y − 12) = 6x− 15y + 36 Answer: 6a− 9b+ 21 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Use the distributive property to expand −5(−2a− 5b+ 8).Expand: −4(−x− 2y − 7) Solution: To distribute the −5, we simply think as follows: “−5(−2a) = 10a, −5(−5b) = 25b, and −5(8) = −40.” This sort of thinking allows us to write down the answer immediately without any additional steps. −5(−2a− 5b+ 8) = 10a+ 25b− 40 Answer: 4x+ 8y + 28 ! 1.5.
