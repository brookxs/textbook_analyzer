Multiplying Polynomial Functions We use function notation to indicate multiplication as follows: Multiplication of functions:   Example 13: Calculate: , given and . Solution: Multiply all terms of the trinomial by the monomial function . Answer:   Example 14: Calculate: , given and . Solution: First, determine . We have Next, substitute −1 for the variable x. Answer:   Because , we could alternatively calculate and separately and then multiply the results (try this as an exercise). However, if we were asked to evaluate multiple values for the function , it would be best to first determine the general form, as we have in the previous example.
