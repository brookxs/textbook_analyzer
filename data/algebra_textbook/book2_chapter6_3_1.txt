Factoring Trinomials of the Form ax^2 + bx + c Factoring trinomials of the form a x 2 + b x + c can be challenging because the middle term is affected by the factors of both a and c. To illustrate this, consider the following factored trinomial: We can multiply to verify that this is the correct factorization. As we have seen before, the product of the first terms of each binomial is equal to the first term of the trinomial. The middle term of the trinomial is the sum of the products of the outer and inner terms of the binomials. The product of the last terms of each binomial is equal to the last term of the trinomial. Visually, we have the following: In general, This gives us, In short, when the leading coefficient of a trinomial is something other than 1, there will be more to consider when determining the factors using the trial and error method. The key lies in the understanding of how the middle term is obtained. Multiply ( 2 x + 5 ) ( 3 x + 7 ) and carefully follow the formation of the middle term. If we think of the FOIL method for multiplying binomials, then the middle term results from the sum of the inner product and the outer product. In this case, 14 x + 15 x = 29 x , as illustrated below: For this reason, we need to look for products of the factors of the first and last terms whose sum is equal to the coefficient of the middle term. For example, to factor 6 x 2 + 29 x + 35 , look at the factors of 6 and 35. The combination that produces the coefficient of the middle term is 2 ⋅ 7 + 3 ⋅ 5 = 14 + 15 = 29 . Make sure that the outer terms have coefficients 2 and 7, and that the inner terms have coefficients 5 and 3. Use this information to factor the trinomial:   Example 1: Factor: 3 x 2 + 7 x + 2 . Solution: Since the leading coefficient and the last term are both prime, there is only one way to factor each. Begin by writing the factors of the first term, 3 x 2 , as follows: The middle and last term are both positive; therefore, the factors of 2 are chosen as positive numbers. In this case, the only choice is in which grouping to place these factors. Determine which grouping is correct by multiplying each expression. Notice that these products differ only in their middle terms. Also, notice that the middle term is the sum of the inner and outer product, as illustrated below: Answer: ( x + 2 ) ( 3 x + 1 )   Example 2: Factor: 12 x 2 + 38 x + 20 . Solution: First, consider the factors of the first and last terms. We search for products of factors whose sum equals the coefficient of the middle term, 38. For brevity, the thought process is illustrated starting with the factors 2 and 6. Factoring begins at this point with the first term. We search for factors of 20 that along with the factors of 12 produce a middle term of 38x. Here the last combination produces a middle term of 38x. Answer: ( 2 x + 5 ) ( 6 x + 4 )   Example 3: Factor: 10 x 2 − 23 x + 6 . Solution: First, consider the factors of the first and last terms. We are searching for products of factors whose sum equals the coefficient of the middle term, −23. Factoring begins at this point with two sets of blank parentheses: Since the last term is positive and the middle term is negative, we know that both factors of the last term must be negative. Here we list all possible combinations with the factors of 10 x 2 = 2 x ⋅ 5 x . There is no combination that produces a middle term of − 23 x . We then move on to the factors of 10 x 2 = 10 x ⋅ x and list all possible combinations: And we can write Answer: ( 10 x − 3 ) ( x − 2 ) . The complete check is left to the reader.   We can reduce much of the guesswork involved in factoring trinomials if we consider all of the factors of the first and last terms and their products.   Example 4: Factor: 5 x 2 + 38 x − 16 . Solution: We begin with the factors of 5 and 16. Since the leading coefficient is prime, we can begin with the following: We look for products of the factors of 5 and 16 that could possibly add to 38. Since the last term is negative, we must look for factors with opposite signs. Here we can see that the products 2 and 40 add up to 38 if they have opposite signs: Therefore, use −2 and 8 as the factors of 16, making sure that the inner and outer products are − 2 x and 40 x : Answer: ( x + 8   ) ( 5 x − 2 ) . The complete check is left to the reader.   After lots of practice, the process described in the previous example can be performed mentally.   Try this! Factor: 12 x 2 − 31 x − 30 . Answer: ( 3 x − 10 ) ( 4 x + 3 ) Video Solution When given trinomials with multiple variables, the process is similar.   Example 5: Factor: 9 x 2 + 30 x y + 25 y 2 . Solution: Search for factors of the first and last terms such that the sum of the inner and outer products equals the middle term. Add the following products to obtain the middle term: 3 x ⋅ 5 y + 3 x ⋅ 5 y = 30 x y . In this example, we have a perfect square trinomial. Check. Answer: ( 3 x + 5 y ) 2   Try this!
