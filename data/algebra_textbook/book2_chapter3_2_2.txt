Graph by Plotting Points Since the solutions to linear equations are ordered pairs, they can be graphed using the rectangular coordinate system. The set of all solutions to a linear equation can be represented on a rectangular coordinate plane using a straight line connecting at least two points; this line is called its graph A point on the number line associated with a coordinate. . To illustrate this, plot five ordered pair solutions, {(−2, 11), (−1, 8), (0, 5), (1, 2), (2, −1)}, to the linear equation 6 x + 2 y = 10 . Notice that the points are collinear; this will be the case for any linear equation. Draw a line through the points with a straightedge, and add arrows on either end to indicate that the graph extends indefinitely. The resulting line represents all solutions to , of which there are infinitely many. The steps for graphing lines by plotting points are outlined in the following example.   Example 5: Find five ordered pair solutions and graph: . Solution: Step 1: Solve for y. Step2: Choose at least two x-values and find the corresponding y-values. In this section, we will choose five real numbers to use as x-values. It is a good practice to choose 0 and some negative numbers, as well as some positive numbers. Five ordered pair solutions are {(−2, −6), (−1, −4), (0, −2), (1, 0), (2, 2)} Step 3: Choose an appropriate scale, plot the points, and draw a line through them using a straightedge. In this case, choose a scale where each tick mark on the y-axis represents 2 units because all the y-values are multiples of 2. Answer: It will not always be the case that y can be solved in terms of x with integer coefficients. In fact, the coefficients often turn out to be fractions.   Example 6: Find five ordered pair solutions and graph: . Solution: Remember that you can choose any real number for the independent variable x, so choose wisely here. Since the denominator of the coefficient of the variable x is 2, you can avoid fractions by choosing multiples of 2 for the x-values. In this case, choose the set of x-values {−6, −4, −2, 0, 2} and find the corresponding y-values. Five solutions are {(−6, −10), (−4, −5), (−2, 0), (0, 5), (2, 10)}. Here we choose to scale the x-axis with multiples of 2 and the y-axis with multiples of 5. Answer:   Try this! Find five ordered pair solutions and graph: .
