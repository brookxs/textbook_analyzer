The Least Common Denominator When adding or subtracting, if the rational expressions do not share a com- mon denominator, you must first make equivalent fractions with a common denominator. Least common denominator. If the fractions a/b and c/d do not share a common denominator, then the least common denominator for b and d is defined as the smallest number (or expression) divisible by both b and d. In symbols, LCD(b, d) represents the least common denominator of b and d. 7.3. SIMPLIFYING RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS 509 You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify: x 6 + 2x 9 Simplify: 3x 8 + 5x 6 Solution: The smallest number divisible by both 6 and 9 is 18; i.e., LCD(6, 9) = 18. We must first make equivalent fractions with a common denominator of 18. x 6 + 2x 9 = x 6 · 3 3 + 2x 9 · 2 2 = 3x 18 + 4x 18 We can now add the numerators and put the result over the common denomi- nator. = 7x 18 Answer: 29x 24 !

RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS Solution: In this example, it is not easy to conjure up the smallest number divisible by both 72 and 108. As we shall see, prime factorization will come to the rescue. 72 9 3 3 8 2 4 2 2 108 4 2 2 27 3 9 3 3 Thus, 72 = 23 · 32 and 108 = 22 · 33. Procedure for finding the least common denominator (LCD). To find the least common denominator for two or more fractions, proceed as follows: 1. Prime factor each denominator, putting your answers in exponential form. 2. To determine the LCD, write down each factor that appears in your prime factorizations to the highest power that it appears. Following the procedure above, we list the prime factorization of each denom- inator in exponential form. The highest power of 2 that appears is 23. The highest power of 3 that appears is 33. 72 = 23 · 32 Prime factor 72. 108 = 22 · 33 Prime factor 108. LCD = 23 · 33 Highest power of 2 is 23. Highest power of 3 is 33. Therefore, the LCD is 23 · 33 = 8 · 27 or 216. Hence: 5y 72 − y 108 = 5y 72 · 3 3 − y 108 · 2 2 Make equivalent fractions. = 15y 216 − 2y 216 Simplify. = 13y 216 Subtract numerators.
