Rational Functions Rational functions have the form where p ( x ) and q ( x ) are polynomials and q ( x ) ≠ 0 . The domain of a rational function consists of all real numbers x such that the denominator q ( x ) ≠ 0 .   Example 12: a. Simplify: r ( x ) = 2 x 2 + 5 x − 3 6 x 2 + 18 x . b. State the domain. c. Calculate r ( − 2 ) . Solution: a. To simplify the rational function, first factor and then cancel. b. To determine the restrictions, set the denominator of the original function equal to 0 and solve. The domain consists of all real numbers x, where x ≠ 0 and x ≠ − 3 . c. Since −2 is not a restriction, substitute it for the variable x using the simplified form. Answers: a. r ( x ) = 2 x − 1 6 x b. The domain is all real numbers except 0 and −3. c. r ( − 2 ) = 5 12   If a cost function A function that represents the cost of producing a certain number of units. C ( x ) represents the cost of producing x units, then the average cost The total cost divided by the number of units produced, which can be represented by c ( x ) = C ( x ) x , where C ( x ) is a cost function. c ( x ) is the cost divided by the number of units produced.   Example 13: The cost in dollars of producing t-shirts with a company logo is given by C ( x ) = 7 x + 200 , where x represents the number of shirts produced. Determine the average cost of producing a. 40 t-shirts b. 250 t-shirts c. 1,000 t-shirts Solution: Set up a function representing the average cost. Next, calculate c ( 40 ) , c ( 250 ) , and c ( 1000 ) . Answers: a. If 40 t-shirts are produced, then the average cost per t-shirt is $12.00. b. If 250 t-shirts are produced, then the average cost per t-shirt is $7.80. c. If 1,000 t-shirts are produced, then the average cost per t-shirt is $7.20.
