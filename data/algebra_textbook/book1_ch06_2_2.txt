Products of Polynomials Previously, we studied multiplication of polynomials (Section Section 4.6). We were given factors and asked to find their product, as shown below. Example 6.1.  Given the factors 4and 8, find the product. 4⋅8 = 32 . The product is 32. Example 6.2.  Given the factors 6x 2 and 2 x − 7 , find the product. 6 x 2 ( 2 x − 7 ) = 12 x 3 − 42 x 2 The product is 12 x 3 − 42 x 2 . Example 6.3.  Given the factors x − 2 y and 3 x + y , find the product. The product is 3x 2 − 5x y − 2y 2 . Example 6.4.  Given the factors a + 8 and a + 8 , find the product. (a + 8) 2 = a 2 + 16a + 64 The product is a 2 + 16a + 64 . Products of Polynomials Previously, we studied multiplication of polynomials (Section Section 4.6).
