 ||  || Multiplication Multiplication is a description of repeated addition. In the addition of 5 + 5 + 5 the number 5 is repeated 3 times. Therefore, we say we have three times five and describe it by writing 3 × 5 Thus, 3 × 5 = 5 + 5 + 5 Multiplicand In a multiplication, the repeated addend (number being added) is called the multi­plicand. In 3 × 5, the 5 is the multiplicand. Multiplier Also, in a multiplication, the number that records the number of times the multiplicand is used is called the multiplier. In 3 × 5, the 3 is the multiplier. Sample Set A Express each repeated addition as a multiplication. In each case, specify the multiplier and the multiplicand. Example 2.1.  7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 6 × 7. Multiplier is 6. Multiplicand is 7. Example 2.2.  18 + 18 + 18 3 × 18. Multiplier is 3. Multiplicand is 18. Practice Set A Express each repeated addition as a multiplication. In each case, specify the multiplier and the multiplicand. Exercise 2.2.1. (Go to Solution) 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 __________.

Multiplicand is __________. Factors In a multiplication, the numbers being multiplied are also called factors. Products The result of a multiplication is called the product. In 3 × 5 = 15, the 3 and 5 are not only called the multiplier and multiplicand, but they are also called factors. The product is 15. Indicators of Multiplication × ,⋅,( ) The multiplication symbol ( × ) is not the only symbol used to indicate multiplication. Other symbols include the dot ( ⋅ ) and pairs of parentheses ( ). The expressions 3 × 5, 3⋅5, 3(5), (3)5, (3)(5) all represent the same product.  || The Multiplication Process With a Single Digit Multiplier Since multiplication is repeated addition, we should not be surprised to notice that carrying can occur. Carrying occurs when we find the product of 38 and 7: First, we compute 7 × 8 = 56. Write the 6 in the ones column. Carry the 5. Then take 7 × 3 = 21. Add to 21 the 5 that was carried: 21 + 5 = 26. The product is 266. Sample Set B Find the following products. Example 2.3.  The product is 192. Example 2.4.  The product is 2,630. Example 2.5.  The product is 16,236.

(Go to Solution)  || The Multiplication Process With a Multiple Digit Multiplier In a multiplication in which the multiplier is composed of two or more digits, the multiplication must take place in parts. The process is as follows: Part 1: First Partial Product Multiply the multiplicand by the ones digit of the multiplier. This product is called the first partial product. Part 2: Second Partial Product Multiply the multiplicand by the tens digit of the multiplier. This product is called the second partial product. Since the tens digit is used as a factor, the second partial product is written below the first partial product so that its rightmost digit appears in the tens column. Part 3: If necessary, continue this way finding partial products. Write each one below the previous one so that the rightmost digit appears in the column directly below the digit that was used as a factor. Part 4: Total Product Add the partial products to obtain the total product. Note It may be necessary to carry when finding each partial product. Sample Set C Example 2.6.  Multiply 326 by 48. Part 1: Part 2: Part 3: This step is unnecessary since all of the digits in the multiplier have been used. Part 4: Add the partial products to obtain the total product. The product is 15,648. Example 2.7.  Multiply 5,369 by 842. Part 1: Part 2: Part 3: The product is 4,520,698. Example 2.8.  Multiply 1,508 by 206. Part 1: Part 2: Since 0 times 1508 is 0, the partial product will not change the identity of the total product (which is obtained by addition). Go to the next partial product. Part 3: The product is 310,648 Practice Set C Exercise 2.2.10. (Go to Solution) Multiply 73 by 14. Exercise 2.2.11. (Go to Solution) Multiply 86 by 52. Exercise 2.2.12.

(Go to Solution) Multiply 813 by 10,000.  || Multiplications With Numbers Ending in Zero Often, when performing a multiplication, one or both of the factors will end in zeros. Such multiplications can be done quickly by aligning the numbers so that the rightmost nonzero digits are in the same column. Sample Set D Perform the multiplication (49,000)(1,200). Since 9 and 2 are the rightmost nonzero digits, put them in the same column. Draw (perhaps mentally) a vertical line to separate the zeros from the nonzeros. Multiply the numbers to the left of the vertical line as usual, then attach to the right end of this product the total number of zeros. The product is 58,800,000 Practice Set D Exercise 2.2.20.

(Go to Solution) 8,940,000 × 205,000  ||  || Division Division is a description of repeated subtraction. In the process of division, the concern is how many times one number is contained in another number. For example, we might be interested in how many 5's are contained in 15. The word times is significant because it implies a relationship between division and multiplication. There are several notations used to indicate division. Suppose Q records the number of times 5 is contained in 15. We can indicate this by writing Each of these division notations describes the same number, represented here by the symbol . Each notation also converts to the same multiplication form. It is In division, Dividend the number being divided into is called the dividend. Divisor the number dividing into the dividend is the divisor. Quotient the result of the division is called the quotient. Sample Set A Find the following quotients using multiplication facts. Example 2.12.  Since , Notice also that Thus, 6 is contained in 18 three times. Example 2.13.  Since , Notice also that 3 could be subtracted exactly 8 times from 24. This implies that 3 is contained in 24 eight times. Example 2.14.  Since , Thus, there are 6 sixes in 36. Example 2.15.  Since , Thus, there are 8 nines in 72.

(Go to Solution)  || Division into Zero (Zero as a Dividend: , a ≠ 0) Let's look at what happens when the dividend (the number being divided into) is zero, and the divisor (the number doing the dividing) is any whole number except zero. The question is What number, if any, is ? Let's represent this unknown quotient by . Then, Converting this division problem to its corresponding multiplication problem, we get From our knowledge of multiplication, we can understand that if the product of two whole numbers is zero, then one or both of the whole numbers must be zero. Since any nonzero whole number is certainly not zero, must represent zero. Then, Zero Divided By Any Nonzero Whole Number Is Zero Zero divided any nonzero whole number is zero.  || Division by Zero (Zero as a Divisor: , a ≠ 0) Now we ask, What number, if any, is ? Letting represent a possible quotient, we get Converting to the corresponding multiplication form, we have Since , . But this is absurd. This would mean that , or . A nonzero whole number cannot equal 0! Thus, does not name a number Division by Zero is Undefined Division by zero does not name a number. It is, therefore, undefined.  || Division by and Into Zero (Zero as a Dividend and Divisor:) We are now curious about zero divided by zero . If we let represent a potential quotient, we get Converting to the multiplication form, This results in This is a statement that is true regardless of the number used in place of .

(Go to Solution) Exercise 2.3.17. (Go to Solution)  ||  || Division with a Single Digit Divisor Our experience with multiplication of whole numbers allows us to perform such divisions as 75÷5. We perform the division by performing the corresponding multiplication, 5 × Q = 75. Each division we considered in Section 2.3 had a one-digit quotient. Now we will consider divisions in which the quotient may consist of two or more digits. For example, 75÷5. Let's examine the division 75÷5. We are asked to determine how many 5's are contained in 75. We'll approach the problem in the following way. Make an educated guess based on experience with multiplication. Find how close the estimate is by multiplying the estimate by 5. If the product obtained in step 2 is less than 75, find out how much less by subtracting it from 75. If the product obtained in step 2 is greater than 75, decrease the estimate until the product is less than 75. Decreasing the estimate makes sense because we do not wish to exceed 75. We can suggest from this discussion that the process of division consists of The Four Steps in Division an educated guess a multiplication a subtraction bringing down the next digit (if necessary) The educated guess can be made by determining how many times the divisor is contained in the dividend by using only one or two digits of the dividend. Sample Set A Example 2.23.  Find 75÷5. Rewrite the problem using a division bracket. Make an educated guess by noting that one 5 is contained in 75 at most 10 times.Since 7 is the tens digit, we estimate that 5 goes into 75 at most 10 times. Now determine how close the estimate is. 10 fives is 10 × 5 = 50. Subtract 50 from 75. Estimate the number of 5's in 25. There are exactly 5 fives in 25. Check: Thus, 75÷5 = 15. The notation in this division can be shortened by writing. Example 2.24.  Find 4,944÷8. Rewrite the problem using a division bracket. 8 goes into 49 at most 6 times, and 9 is in the hundreds column. We'll guess 600. Then, 8 × 600 = 4800. 8 goes into 14 at most 1 time, and 4 is in the tens column. We'll guess 10. 8 goes into 64 exactly 8 times. 600 eights + 10 eights + 8 eights = 618 eights. Check: Thus, 4,944÷8 = 618. As in the first problem, the notation in this division can be shortened by eliminating the subtraction signs and the zeros in each educated guess. Note Not all divisions end in zero. We will examine such divisions in a subsequent subsection. Practice Set A Perform the following divisions. Exercise 2.4.1. (Go to Solution) 126÷7 Exercise 2.4.2.

(Go to Solution) 757,125÷9  || Division with a Multiple Digit Divisor The process of division also works when the divisor consists of two or more digits. We now make educated guesses using the first digit of the divisor and one or two digits of the dividend. Sample Set B Example 2.25.  Find 2,232÷36. Use the first digit of the divisor and the first two digits of the dividend to make the educated guess. 3 goes into 22 at most 7 times. Try 7: 7 × 36 = 252 which is greater than 223. Reduce the estimate. Try 6: 6 × 36 = 216 which is less than 223. Divide 3 into 7 to estimate the number of times 36 goes into 72. The 3 goes into 7 at most 2 times. Try 2: 2 × 36 = 72. Check: Thus, 2,232÷36 = 62. Example 2.26.  Find 2,417,228÷802. First, the educated guess: 24÷8 = 3. Then 3 × 802 = 2406, which is less than 2417. Use 3 as the guess. Since 3 × 802 = 2406, and 2406 has four digits, place the 3 above the fourth digit of the dividend. Subtract: 2417 - 2406 = 11. Bring down the 2. The divisor 802 goes into 112 at most 0 times. Use 0. The 8 goes into 11 at most 1 time, and 1 × 802 = 802, which is less than 1122. Try 1. Subtract 1122 – 802 = 320 Bring down the 8. 8 goes into 32 at most 4 times. 4 × 802 = 3208. Use 4. Check: Thus, 2,417,228÷802 = 3,014. Practice Set B Perform the following divisions. Exercise 2.4.6. (Go to Solution) 1,376÷32 Exercise 2.4.7. (Go to Solution) 6,160÷55 Exercise 2.4.8.

Repeated subtraction yields Since the remainder is less than 4, we stop the subtraction. Thus, 4 goes into 10 two times with 2 remaining. We can write this as a division as follows. Since 4 does not divide into 2 (the remainder is less than the divisor) and there are no digits to bring down to continue the process, we are done. We write or Sample Set C Example 2.27.  Find 85÷3. There are no more digits to bring down to continue the process. We are done. One is the remainder. Check: Multiply 28 and 3, then add 1. Thus, . Example 2.28.  Find 726÷23.

If, however, the division should result in a remainder, the calculator is unable to provide us with the particular value of the remainder. Also, some calculators (most nonscientific) are unable to perform divisions in which one of the numbers has more than eight digits. Sample Set D Use a calculator to perform each division.
