Roots In the English language, the word "root" can mean a source of something. In mathematical terms, the word "root" is used to indicate that one number is the source of another number through repeated multiplication. Square Root We know that 49 = 72 , that is, 49 = 7⋅7. Through repeated multiplication, 7 is the source of 49. Thus, 7 is a root of 49. Since two 7's must be multiplied together to produce 49, the 7 is called the second or square root of 49. Cube Root We know that 8 = 23 , that is, 8 = 2⋅2⋅2. Through repeated multiplication, 2 is the source of 8. Thus, 2 is a root of 8. Since three 2's must be multiplied together to produce 8, 2 is called the third or cube root of 8. We can continue this way to see such roots as fourth roots, fifth roots, sixth roots, and so on.
