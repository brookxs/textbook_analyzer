Evaluating Polynomials Given the values for the variables in a polynomial, we can substitute and simplify using the order of operations.   Example 5: Evaluate: 3 x − 1 , where x = − 3 2 . Solution: First, replace the variable with parentheses and then substitute the given value. Answer: −11/2   Example 6: Evaluate: 3 x 2 + 2 x − 1 , where x = − 1 . Solution: Answer: 0   Example 7: Evaluate: − 2 a 2 b + a b 2 − 7 , where a = 3 and b = − 2 . Solution: Answer: 41   Example 8: The volume of a sphere in cubic units is given by the formula V = 4 3 π r 3 , where r is the radius. Calculate the volume of a sphere with radius r = 3 2 meters. Solution: Answer: 9 2 π cubic meters   Try this! Evaluate: x 3 − x 2 + 4 x − 2 , where x = − 3 .
