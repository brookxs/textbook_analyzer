Division into Zero (Zero as a Dividend: , a ≠ 0) Let's look at what happens when the dividend (the number being divided into) is zero, and the divisor (the number doing the dividing) is any whole number except zero. The question is What number, if any, is ? Let's represent this unknown quotient by . Then, Converting this division problem to its corresponding multiplication problem, we get From our knowledge of multiplication, we can understand that if the product of two whole numbers is zero, then one or both of the whole numbers must be zero. Since any nonzero whole number is certainly not zero, must represent zero. Then, Zero Divided By Any Nonzero Whole Number Is Zero Zero divided any nonzero whole number is zero.
