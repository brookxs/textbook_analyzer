Reading Exponential Notation In x n , Base x is the base Exponent n is the exponent Power The number represented by x n is called a power. x to the n th Power The term x n is read as " x to the n th power," or more simply as " x to the n th." x Squared and x Cubed The symbol x 2 is often read as " x squared," and x 3 is often read as " x cubed." A natural question is "Why are geometric terms appearing in the exponent expression?" The answer for x 3 is this: x 3 means x⋅x⋅x . In geometry, the volume of a rectangular box is found by multiplying the length by the width by the depth. A cube has the same length on each side. If we represent this length by the letter x then the volume of the cube is x⋅x⋅x , which, of course, is described by x 3 . (Can you think of why x 2 is read as x squared?) Cube withlength = x width = x depth = x Volume = x x x = x 3 Reading Exponential Notation In x n , Base x is the base Exponent n is the exponent Power The number represented by x n is called a power. x to the n th Power The term x n is read as " x to the n th power," or more simply as " x to the n th." x Squared and x Cubed The symbol x 2 is often read as " x squared," and x 3 is often read as " x cubed."
