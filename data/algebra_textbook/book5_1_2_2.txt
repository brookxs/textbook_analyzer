Absolute Value Bars as Grouping Symbols Like parentheses and brackets, you must evaluate what is inside them first, then take the absolute value of the result. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Simplify: −8− |5− 11|Simplify: −|− 4− 6| Solution. We must first evaluate what is inside the absolute value bars. −8− |5− 11| = −8− |5 + (−11)| Add the opposite. = −8− |− 6| Add: 5 + (−11) = −6. The number −6 is 6 units from zero on the number line. Hence, |− 6| = 6. = −8− 6 Add: |− 6| = 6. = −8 + (−6) Add the opposite. = −14 Add. Thus, −8− |5− 11| = −14.Answer: −10 !
