 || Grouping Symbols In a computation where more than one operation is involved, grouping symbols help tell us which operations to perform first. The grouping symbols Parentheses, brackets, braces, and the fraction bar are the common symbols used to group expressions and mathematical operations within a computation. commonly used in algebra are All of the above grouping symbols, as well as absolute value, have the same order of precedence. Perform operations inside the innermost grouping symbol or absolute value first.   Example 1: Simplify: 5 − ( 4 − 12 ) . Solution: Perform the operations within the parentheses first. In this case, first subtract 12 from 4. Answer: 13   Example 2: Simplify: 3 { − 2 [ − ( − 3 − 1 ) ] } . Solution: Answer: −24   Example 3: Simplify: 5 − ∣ ∣ 4 − ( − 3 ) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ − 3 ∣ ∣ − ( 5 − 7 ) . Solution: The fraction bar groups the numerator and denominator. They should be simplified separately. Answer: − 2 5   Try this! Simplify: − [ − 3 ( 2 + 3 ) ] . Answer: 15 Video Solution  || Order of Operations When several operations are to be applied within a calculation, we must follow a specific order To ensure a single correct result, perform mathematical operations in a specific order. to ensure a single correct result. Perform all calculations within the innermost parentheses or grouping symbols. Evaluate all exponents. Perform multiplication and division operations from left to right. Finally, perform all remaining addition and subtraction operations from left to right. Caution: Note that multiplication and division operations must be worked from left to right.   Example 4: Simplify: 5 2 − 4 ⋅ 3 ÷ 12 . Solution: First, evaluate 5 2 and then perform multiplication and division as they appear from left to right. Answer: 24   Because multiplication and division operations should be worked from left to right, it is sometimes correct to perform division before multiplication.   Example 5: Simplify: 2 4 − 12 ÷ 3 ⋅ 2 + 11 . Solution: Begin by evaluating the exponent, 2 4 = 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 = 16 . Multiplying first leads to an incorrect result. Answer: 19   Example 6: Simplify: − 3 − 5 2 + ( − 7 ) 2 . Solution: Take care to correctly identify the base when squaring. Answer: 21   Example 7: Simplify: 5 − 3 [ 2 3 − 5 + 7 ( − 3 ) ] . Solution: It is tempting to first subtract 5 − 3, but this will lead to an incorrect result. The order of operations requires us to simplify within the brackets first. Subtracting 5 − 3 first leads to an incorrect result. Answer: 59   Example 8: Simplify: − 3 2 − [ 5 − ( 4 2 − 10 ) ] . Solution: Perform the operations within the innermost parentheses first. Answer: −8   Example 9: Simplify: ( − 2 3 ) 2 ÷ [ 5 3 − ( − 1 2 ) 3 ] . Solution: Answer: 32 129   We are less likely to make a mistake if we work one operation at a time. Some problems may involve an absolute value, in which case we assign it the same order of precedence as parentheses.   Example 10: Simplify: 2 − 4 | − 4 − 3 | + ( − 2 ) 4 . Solution: We begin by evaluating the absolute value and then the exponent ( − 2 ) 4 = ( − 2 ) ( − 2 ) ( − 2 ) ( − 2 ) = + 16 . Answer: −10   Try this! Simplify: 10 ÷ 5 ⋅ 2 | ( − 4 ) + | − 3 | | + ( − 3 ) 2 . Answer: 13 Video Solution  ||
