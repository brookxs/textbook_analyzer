Simplify:Simplify: (3s2 − 2st+ 4t2)+ (s2 + 7st− 5t2) (a2 + 3ab− b2) + (4a2 + 11ab− 9b2) Solution: Use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup. Then combine like terms. (a2 + 3ab− b2) + (4a2 + 11ab− 9b2) = (a2 + 4a2) + (3ab+ 11ab) + (−b2 − 9b2) = 5a2 + 14ab− 10b2 Answer: 4s2 + 5st− t2 ! Let’s combine some polynomial functions. You Try It!

Solution: First, replace f(x) and g(x) with their definitions. Be sure to surround each polynomial with parentheses, because we are asked to add all of f(x) to all of g(x). f(x) + g(x) = (3x2 − 4x− 8) + (x2 − 11x+ 15) Now use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup. Combine like terms. = (3x2 + x2) + (−4x− 11x) + (−8 + 15) = 4x2 − 15x+ 7 Hence, f(x) + g(x) = 4x2 − 15x+ 7.Answer: x2 + 5x− 2 !

First recall that negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. Negating. If a is any number, then −a = (−1)a. That is, negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. We can use this property to simplify −(a + b). First, negating is identical to multiplying by −1. Then we can distribute the −1. −(a+ b) = (−1)(a+ b) Negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. = (−1)a+ (−1)b Distribute the −1. = −a+ (−b) Simplify: (−1)a = −a and (−1)b = −b. = −a− b Subtraction means add the opposite. 336 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Thus, −(a + b) = −a − b. However, it is probably simpler to note that the minus sign in front of the parentheses simply changed the sign of each term inside the parentheses. Negating a sum. When negating a sum of terms, the effect of the minus sign is to change each term in the parentheses to the opposite sign. −(a+ b) = −a− b Let’s look at this principle in the next example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify: −(−3x2 + 4x− 8)Simplify: −(2x2 − 3x+ 9) Solution: First, negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. Then distribute the −1. − (−3x2 + 4x− 8) = (−1)(−3x2 + 4x− 8) Negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. = (−1)(−3x2) + (−1)(4x)− (−1)(8) Distribute the −1. = 3x2 + (−4x)− (−8) Simplify: (−1)(−3x2) = 3x2, (−1)(4x) = −4x, and and (−1)(8) = −8. = 3x2 − 4x+ 8 Subtraction means add the opposite. Alternate solution: As we saw above, a negative sign in front of a parentheses simply changes the sign of each term inside the parentheses. So it is much more efficient to write −(−3x2 + 4x− 8) = 3x2 − 4x+ 8, simply changing the sign of each term inside the parentheses.Answer: −2x2 + 3x− 9 !  || Subtracting Polynomials Now that we know how to negate a polynomial (change the sign of each term of the polynomial), we’re ready to subtract polynomials. 5.4.

Simplify: Simplify: (4a2b+ 2ab− 7ab2)− (2a2b− ab− 5ab2)(y3 − 3y2z + 4yz2 + z3)− (2y3 − 8y2z + 2yz2 − 8z3) Solution: First, distribute the minus sign, changing the sign of each term of the second polynomial. (y3 − 3y2z + 4yz2 + z3)− (2y3 − 8y2z + 2yz2 − 8z3) = y3 − 3y2z + 4yz2 + z3 − 2y3 + 8y2z − 2yz2 + 8z3 Regroup, combining like terms. You may perform this next step mentally if you wish. = (y3 − 2y3) + (−3y2z + 8y2z) + (4yz2 − 2yz2) + (z3 + 8z3) = −y3 + 5y2z + 2yz2 + 9z3 Answer: 2a2b+ 3ab− 2ab2 ! Let’s subtract two polynomial functions. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Given p(x) = −5x3 + 6x − 9 and q(x) = 6x2 − 7x − 11, Given f(x) = 3x2 + 9x− 4 and g(x) = −5x2 + 4x− 6, simplify f(x)− g(x). simplify p(x) − q(x). Solution: First, replace p(x) and q(x) with their definitions. Because we are asked to subtract all of q(x) from all of p(x), it is critical to surround each polynomial with parentheses. p(x) − q(x) = (−5x3 + 6x− 9)− (6x2 − 7x− 11) Distribute the minus sign, changing the sign of each term in the second poly- nomial, then regroup and combine like terms. = −5x3 + 6x− 9− 6x2 + 7x+ 11 = −5x3 − 6x2 + (6x+ 7x) + (−9 + 11) = −5x3 − 6x2 + 13x+ 2 However, after distributing the minus sign, if we can combine like terms men- tally, eliminating the middle step, it is much more efficient to write: p(x)− q(x) = (−5x3 + 6x− 9)− (6x2 − 7x− 11) = −5x3 + 6x− 9− 6x2 + 7x+ 11 = −5x3 − 6x2 + 13x+ 2 Answer: 8x2 + 5x+ 2 ! 338 CHAPTER 5.

The two shaded squares in Figure 5.33 have areas A1 = x2 and A3 = 9, respec- tively. The two unshaded rectangles in Figure 5.33 have areas A2 = 3x and A4 = 3x. Summing these four areas gives us the area of the entire figure. A = A1 +A2 +A3 +A4 = x2 + 3x+ 9 + 3x = x2 + 6x+ 9 Answer: x2 + 8x+ 16 ! 5.4. ADDING AND SUBTRACTING POLYNOMIALS 339 You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Ginger runs a business selling wicker baskets. Her business The costs for producing and selling x widgets are given by the polynomial function C(x) = 50 + 5x− 0.5x2, and the revenue for selling x widgets is given by the polynomial function R(x) = 3.5x. Determine the profit if 75 widgets are sold. costs for producing and selling x wicker baskets are given by the polynomial function C(x) = 100+3x−0.02x2. The revenue she earns from selling x wicker baskets is given by the polynomial function R(x) = 2.75x. Find a formula for P (x), the profit made from selling x wicker baskets. Use your formula to determine Ginger’s profit if she sells 123 wicker baskets. Solution: The profit made from selling x wicker baskets is found by subtract- ing the costs incurred from the revenue received. In symbols: P (x) = R(x)− C(x) Next, replace R(x) and C(x) with their definitions. Because we are supposed to subtract all of the cost from the revenue, be sure to surround the cost polynomial with parentheses. P (x) = 2.75x− (100 + 3x− 0.02x2) Distribute the minus sign and combine like terms. = 2.75x− 100− 3x+ 0.02x2 = 0.02x2 − 0.25x− 100 Thus, the profit function is P (x) = 0.02x2 − 0.25x− 100. Next, to determine the profit if 123 wicker baskets are sold, substitute 123 for x in the profit function P (x). P (x) = 0.02x2 − 0.25x− 100 P (123) = 0.02(123)2 − 0.25(123)− 100 You can now use your graphing calculator to determine the profit (see Figure 5.34). Hence, the profit made from selling 123 wicker baskets is $171.83. Figure 5.34: Determining the profit from selling 123 wicker baskets. Answer: $2,650 ! 340 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS ! ! !  ||
