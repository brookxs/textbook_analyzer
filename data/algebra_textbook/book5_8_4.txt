8.4 The Quadratic Formula We first start with the definition of a quadratic equation. Quadratic equation. A second degree polynomial equation of the form ax2 + bx+ c = 0, where a, b, and c are any real numbers, is called a quadratic equation in x. The goal of this section is to develop a formulaic shortcut that will provide exact solutions of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx+ c = 0. We start by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. ax2 + bx+ c = 0 Quadratic equation. ax2 + bx = −c Subtract c from both sides. In preparation for completing the square, we next divide both sides of the equation by a. x2 + b a x = − c a Divide both sides by a. Now we complete the square. Take one-half of the coefficient of x, then square the result. 1 2 · b a = b 2a when squared gives ( b 2a )2 = b2 4a2 We now add b2/(4a2) to both sides of the equation. x2 + b a x+ b2 4a2 = − c a + b2 4a2 Add b2/(4a2) to both sides. On the left, we factor the perfect square trinomial. On the right, we make equivalent fractions with a common denominator.( x+ b 2a )2 = − c a · 4a 4a + b2 4a2 On the left, factor. On the right, create equivalent fractions with a common denominator.( x+ b 2a )2 = −4ac 4a2 + b2 4a2 Multiply numerators and denominators.( x+ b 2a )2 = b2 − 4ac 4a2 Add fractions. 572 CHAPTER 8. QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS When we take the square root, there are two answers. x+ b 2a = ± √ b2 − 4ac 4a2 Two square roots. When you take the square root of a fraction, you take the square root of both the numerator and denominator. x+ b 2a = ± √ b2 − 4ac√ 4a2 x+ b 2a = ± √ b2 − 4ac 2a Simplify: √ 4a2 = 2a. x = − b 2a ± √ b2 − 4ac 2a Subtract b/(2a) from both sides. Because both fractions have the same denominator, we can add and subtract numerators and put the answer over the common denominator. x = −b±√b2 − 4ac 2a The quadratic formula. The equation ax2 + bx+ c = 0 is called a quadratic equation. Its solutions are given by x = −b±√b2 − 4ac 2a , called the quadratic formula. Whew! Fortunately, the result is a lot easier to apply than it is to develop! Let’s try some examples. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve for x: x2 − 4x− 5 = 0.Solve for x: x2 − 8x+ 12 = 0 Solution: The integer pair 1,−5 has product ac = −5 and sum b = −4. Hence, this trinomial factors. x2 − 4x− 5 = 0 (x+ 1)(x− 5) = 0 Now we can use the zero product property to write: x+ 1 = 0 or x− 5 = 0 x = −1 x = 5 8.4. THE QUADRATIC FORMULA 573 Thus, the solutions are x = −1 and x = 5. Now, let’s give the quadratic formula a try. First, we must compare our equation with the quadratic equation, then determine the values of a, b, and c. ax2 + bx+ c = 0 x2 − 4x− 5 = 0 Comparing equations, we see that a = 1, b = −4, and c = −5. We will now plug these numbers into the quadratic formula. First, replace each occurrence of a, b, and c in the quadratic formula with open parentheses. x = −b±√b2 − 4ac 2a The quadratic formula. x = −( )±√( )2 − 4( )( ) 2( ) Replace a, b, and c with open parentheses. Now we can substitute: 1 for a, −4 for b, and −5 for c. x = −(−4)±√(−4)2 − 4(1)(−5) 2(1) Substitute: 1 for a, −4 for b, and −5 for c. x = 4±√16 + 20 2 Simplify. Exponent first, then multiplication. x = 4±√36 2 Add: 16 + 20 = 36. x = 4± 6 2 Simplify: √ 36 = 6. Note that because of the “plus or minus” symbol, we have two answers. x = 4− 6 2 or x = 4 + 6 2 x = −2 2 x = 10 2 x = −1 x = 5 Note that these answers match the answers found using the ac-test to factor the trinomial.

Compare x2 − 5x− 7 = 0 with ax2 + bx+ c = 0 and note that a = 1, b = −5, and c = −7. Replace each occurrence of a, b, and c with open parentheses to prepare the quadratic formula for substitution. x = −b±√b2 − 4ac 2a The quadratic formula. x = −( )±√( )2 − 4( )( ) 2( ) Replace a, b, and c with open parentheses. Substitute 1 for a, −5 for b, and −7 for c. x = −(−5)±√(−5)2 − 4(1)(−7) 2(1) Substitute: a = 1, b = −5, c = −7. x = 5±√25 + 28 2 Exponents and multiplication first. x = 5±√53 2 Simplify. Check: Use the calculator to check each solution (see Figure 8.16). Note that in storing (5−√53)/2 in X, we must surround the numerator in parentheses. Figure 8.16: Check (5 −√53)/2 and (5 +√53)/2. In each image in Figure 8.16, after storing the solution in X, note that the left- and right-hand sides of the original equation x2 = 5x + 7 produce the same number, verifying that our solutions are correct.Answer: (−7+√89)/2, (−7−√89)/2 ! 8.4.

Solve for x: 7x2 − 10x+ 1 = 0. Solve for x: 3x2 +8x+2 = 0 Solution: Compare 7x2 − 10x + 1 = 0 with ax2 + bx + c = 0 and note that a = 7, b = −10, and c = 1. Replace each occurrence of a, b, and c with open parentheses to prepare the quadratic formula for substitution. x = −b±√b2 − 4ac 2a The quadratic formula. x = −( )±√( )2 − 4( )( ) 2( ) Replace a, b, and c with open parentheses. Substitute 7 for a, −10 for b, and 1 for c. x = −(−10)±√(−10)2 − 4(7)(1) 2(7) Substitute: 7 for a, −10 for b, and 1 for c x = 10±√100− 28 14 Exponent, then multiplication. x = 10±√72 14 Simplify. In this case, note that we can factor out a perfect square, namely √ 36. x = 10±√36√2 14 √ 72 = √ 36 √ 2. x = 10± 6√2 14 Simplify: √ 36 = 6 Finally, notice that both numerator and denominator are divisible by 2. x = 10± 6√2 2 14 2 Divide numerator and denominator by 2. x = 10 2 ± 6 √ 2 2 14 2 Distribute the 2. x = 5± 3√2 7 Simplify. 576 CHAPTER 8.

An object is launched vertically and its height y (in feet)An object is launched vertically and its height y (in feet) above ground level is given by the equation y = 160 + 96t− 16t2, where t is the time (in seconds) that has passed since its launch. How much time must pass after the launch before the object returns to ground level? above ground level is given by the equation y = 320+192t−16t2, where t is the time (in seconds) that has passed since its launch. How much time must pass after the launch before the object returns to ground level? After placing the answer in simple form and reducing, use your calculator to round the answer to the nearest tenth of a second. Solution: When the object returns to ground level, its height y above ground level is y = 0 feet. To find the time when this occurs, substitute y = 0 in the formula y = 320 + 192t− 16t2 and solve for t. y = 320 + 192t− 16t2 Original equation. 0 = 320 + 192t− 16t2 Set y = 0. Each of the coefficients is divisible by −16. 0 = t2 − 12t− 20 Divide both sides by −16. Compare t2− 12t− 20 = 0 with at2 + bt+ c = 0 and note that a = 1, b = −12, and c = −20. Replace each occurrence of a, b, and c with open parentheses to prepare the quadratic formula for substitution. Note that we are solving for t this time, not x. x = −b±√b2 − 4ac 2a The quadratic formula. x = −( )±√( )2 − 4( )( ) 2( ) Replace a, b, and c with open parentheses. 8.4. THE QUADRATIC FORMULA 577 Substitute 1 for a, −12 for b, and −20 for c. t = −(−12)±√(−12)2 − 4(1)(−20) 2(1) Substitute: 1 for a, −12 for b, and −20 for c t = 12±√144 + 80 2 Exponent, then multiplication. t = 12±√224 2 Simplify. The answer is not in simple form, as we can factor out √ 16. t = 12±√16√14 2 √ 224 = √ 16 √ 14. t = 12± 4√14 2 Simplify: √ 16 = 4 Use the distributive property to divide both terms in the numerator by 2. t = 12 2 ± 4 √ 14 2 Divide both terms by 2. t = 6± 2√14 Simplify. Thus, we have two solutions, t = 6 − 2√14 and t = 6 + 2√14. Use your calculator to find decimal approximations, then round to the nearest tenth. t ≈ −1.5, 13.5 The negative time is irrelevant, so to the nearest tenth of a second, it takes the object approximately 13.5 seconds to return to ground level. Answer: 3 + √ 19 ≈ 7.4 seconds ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Arnie gets on his bike at noon and begins to ride due north At 6:00 am, a freight train passes through Sagebrush Junction heading west at 40 miles per hour. At 8:00 am, a passenger train passes through the junction heading south at 60 miles per hour. At what time of the day, correct to the nearest minute, will the two trains be 180 miles apart? at a constant rate of 12 miles per hour. At 1:00 pm, Barbara gets on her bike at the same starting point and begins to ride due east at a constant rate of 8 miles per hour. At what time of the day will they be 50 miles apart (as the crow flies)? Don’t worry about simple form, just report the time of day, correct to the nearest minute. Solution: At the moment they are 50 miles apart, let t represent the time that Arnie has been riding since noon. Because Barbara started at 1 pm, she has been riding for one hour less than Arnie. So, let t − 1 represent the numbers of hours that Barbara has been riding at the moment they are 50 miles apart. 578 CHAPTER 8. QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS Now, if Arnie has been riding at a constant rate of 12 miles per hour for t hours, then he has traveled a distance of 12t miles. Because Barbara has been riding at a constant rate of 8 miles per hour for t− 1 hours, she has traveled a distance of 8(t− 1) miles. 8(t− 1) 5012t Figure 8.17: 50 miles apart. The distance and direction traveled by Arnie and Barbara are marked in Figure 8.17. Note that we have a right triangle, so the sides of the triangle must satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem. That is, (12t)2 + [8(t− 1)]2 = 502. Use the Pythagorean Theorem. Distribute the 8. (12t)2 + (8t− 8)2 = 502 Distribute the 8. Square each term. Use (a− b)2 = a2 − 2ab+ b2 to expand (8t− 8)2. 144t2 + 64t2 − 128t+ 64 = 2500 Square each term. 208t2 − 128t+ 64 = 2500 Simplify: 144t2 + 64t2 = 208t2 The resulting equation is nonlinear. Make one side equal to zero. 208t2 − 128t− 2436 = 0 Subtract 2500 from both sides. 52t2 − 32t− 609 = 0 Divide both sides by 4. Compare 52t2 − 32t − 609 = 0 with at2 + bt + c = 0 and note that a = 52, b = −32, and c = −609. Replace each occurrence of a, b, and c with open parentheses to prepare the quadratic formula for substitution. Note that we are solving for t this time, not x. x = −b±√b2 − 4ac 2a The quadratic formula. x = −( )±√( )2 − 4( )( ) 2( ) Replace a, b, and c with open parentheses. Substitute 52 for a, −32 for b, and −609 for c. t = −(−32)±√(−32)2 − 4(52)(−609) 2(52) Substitute: 52 for a, −32 for b, and −609 for c t = 32±√1024 + 126672 104 Exponent, then multiplication. t = 32±√127696 104 Simplify. Now, as the request is for an approximate time, we won’t bother with simple form and reduction, but proceed immediately to the calculator to approximate 8.4. THE QUADRATIC FORMULA 579 Figure 8.18: Approximate time that Arnie has been riding. this last result (see Figure 8.18). Thus, Arnie has been riding for approxi- mately 3.743709336 hours. To change the fractional part 0.743709336 hours to minutes, multiply by 60min/hr. 0.743709336 hr = 0.743709336 hr× 60min hr = 44.62256016min Rounding to the nearest minute, Arnie has been riding for approximately 3 hours and 45 minutes. Because Arnie started riding at noon, the time at which he and Barbara are 50 miles apart is approximately 3:45 pm. Answer: 9:42 am ! 580 CHAPTER 8.

Note that we are solving for t this time, not x. x = −b±√b2 − 4ac 2a The quadratic formula. x = −( )±√( )2 − 4( )( ) 2( ) Replace a, b, and c with open parentheses. Substitute 52 for a, −32 for b, and −609 for c. t = −(−32)±√(−32)2 − 4(52)(−609) 2(52) Substitute: 52 for a, −32 for b, and −609 for c t = 32±√1024 + 126672 104 Exponent, then multiplication. t = 32±√127696 104 Simplify. Now, as the request is for an approximate time, we won’t bother with simple form and reduction, but proceed immediately to the calculator to approximate 8.4. THE QUADRATIC FORMULA 579 Figure 8.18: Approximate time that Arnie has been riding. this last result (see Figure 8.18). Thus, Arnie has been riding for approxi- mately 3.743709336 hours. To change the fractional part 0.743709336 hours to minutes, multiply by 60min/hr. 0.743709336 hr = 0.743709336 hr× 60min hr = 44.62256016min Rounding to the nearest minute, Arnie has been riding for approximately 3 hours and 45 minutes. Because Arnie started riding at noon, the time at which he and Barbara are 50 miles apart is approximately 3:45 pm. Answer: 9:42 am ! 580 CHAPTER 8. QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS ! ! !  ||
