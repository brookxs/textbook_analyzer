The Order of Operations In Section Section 2.2 we were introduced to the order of operations. It was noted that we would insert another operation before multiplication and division. We can do that now. The Order of Operations Perform all operations inside grouping symbols beginning with the innermost set. Perform all exponential operations as you come to them, moving left-to-right. Perform all multiplications and divisions as you come to them, moving left-to-right. Perform all additions and subtractions as you come to them, moving left-to-right. The Order of Operations In Section Section 2.2 we were introduced to the order of operations.
