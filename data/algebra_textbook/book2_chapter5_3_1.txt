Adding Polynomials Recall that we combine like terms, or terms with the same variable part, as a means to simplify expressions. To do this, add the coefficients of the terms to obtain a single term with the same variable part. For example, Notice that the variable part, x 2 , does not change. This, in addition to the commutative and associative properties of addition, allows us to add polynomials The process of combining all like terms of two or more polynomials. .   Example 1: Add: 3 x + ( 4 x − 5 ) . Solution: The property + ( a + b ) = a + b , which was derived using the distributive property, allows us to remove the parentheses so that we can add like terms. Answer: 7 x − 5   Example 2: Add: ( 3 x 2 + 3 x + 5 ) + ( 2 x 2 − x − 2 ) . Solution: Remove the parentheses and then combine like terms. Answer: 5 x 2 + 2 x + 3   Example 3: Add: ( − 5 x 2 y − 2 x y 2 + 7 x y ) + ( 4 x 2 y + 7 x y 2 − 3 x y ) . Solution: Remember that the variable parts have to be exactly the same before we can add the coefficients. Answer: − x 2 y + 5 x y 2 + 4 x y   It is common practice to present the terms of the simplified polynomial expression in descending order based on their degree. In other words, we typically present polynomials in standard form, with terms in order from highest to lowest degree.   Example 4: Add: ( a − 4 a 3 + a 5 − 8 ) + ( − 9 a 5 + a 4 − 7 a + 5 + a 3 ) . Solution: Answer: − 8 a 5 + a 4 − 3 a 3 − 6 a − 3   Try this! Add: ( 6 − 5 x 3 + x 2 − x ) + ( x 2 + x + 6 x 3 − 1 ) . Answer: x 3 + 2 x 2 + 5 Video Solution Adding Polynomials Recall that we combine like terms, or terms with the same variable part, as a means to simplify expressions.
