Negative Exponents In this section, we define what it means to have negative integer exponents. We begin with the following equivalent fractions: Notice that 4, 8, and 32 are all powers of 2. Hence we can write 4 = 2 2 , 8 = 2 3 , and 32 = 2 5 . If the exponent of the term in the denominator is larger than the exponent of the term in the numerator, then the application of the quotient rule for exponents results in a negative exponent. In this case, we have the following: We conclude that 2 − 3 = 1 2 3 . This is true in general and leads to the definition of negative exponents x − n = 1 x n , given any integer n, where x is nonzero. . Given any integer n and x ≠ 0 , then Here x ≠ 0 because 1 0 is undefined. For clarity, in this section, assume all variables are nonzero. Simplifying expressions with negative exponents requires that we rewrite the expression with positive exponents.   Example 1: Simplify: 10 − 2 . Solution: Answer: 1 100   Example 2: Simplify: ( − 3 ) − 1 . Solution: Answer: − 1 3   Example 3: Simplify: 1 y − 3 . Solution: Answer: y 3   At this point we highlight two very important examples, If the grouped quantity is raised to a negative exponent, then apply the definition and write the entire grouped quantity in the denominator. If there is no grouping, then apply the definition only to the base preceding the exponent.   Example 4: Simplify: ( 2 a b ) − 3 . Solution: First, apply the definition of −3 as an exponent and then apply the power of a product rule. Answer: 1 8 a 3 b 3   Example 5: Simplify: ( − 3 x y 3 ) − 2 . Solution: Answer: 1 9 x 2 y 6   Example 6: Simplify: x − 3 y − 4 . Solution: Answer: y 4 x 3   The previous example suggests a property of quotients with negative exponents x − n y − m = y m x n , given any integers m and n, where x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0 . . If given any integers m and n, where x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0 , then In other words, negative exponents in the numerator can be written as positive exponents in the denominator, and negative exponents in the denominator can be written as positive exponents in the numerator.   Example 7: Simplify: − 2 x − 5 y 3 z − 2 . Solution: Take care with the coefficient −2; recognize that this is the base and that the exponent is actually +1: − 2 = ( − 2 ) 1 . Hence the rules of negative exponents do not apply to this coefficient; leave it in the numerator. Answer: − 2 y 3 z 2 x 5   Example 8: Simplify: ( − 3 x − 4 ) − 3 y − 2 . Solution: Apply the power of a product rule before applying negative exponents. Answer: − x 12 y 2 27   Example 9: Simplify: ( 3 x 2 ) − 4 ( − 2 y − 1 z 3 ) − 2 . Solution: Answer: 4 z 6 81 x 8 y 2   Example 10: Simplify: ( 5 x 2 y ) 3 x − 5 y − 3 . Solution: First, apply the power of a product rule and then the quotient rule. Answer: 125 x 11 y 6   To summarize, we have the following rules for negative integer exponents with nonzero bases: Negative exponents: x − n = 1 x n Quotients with negative exponents: x − n y − m = y m x n   Try this!
