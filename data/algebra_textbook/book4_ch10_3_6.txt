Opposites Opposites On the number line, each real number, other than zero, has an image on the opposite side of 0. For this reason, we say that each real number has an opposite. Opposites are the same distance from zero but have opposite signs. The opposite of a real number is denoted by placing a negative sign directly in front of the number. Thus, if a is any real number, then − a is its opposite. Note The letter " a " is a variable. Thus, " a " need not be positive, and " – a " need not be negative. If a is any real number, − a is opposite a on the number line. Opposites Opposites On the number line, each real number, other than zero, has an image on the opposite side of 0.
