The Process Of Division In Section Section 8.3 we studied the method of reducing rational expressions. For example, we observed how to reduce an expression such as Our method was to factor both the numerator and denominator, then divide out common factors. When the numerator and denominator have no factors in common, the division may still occur, but the process is a little more involved than merely factoring. The method of dividing one polynomial by another is much the same as that of dividing one number by another. First, we’ll review the steps in dividing numbers.  We are to divide 35 by 8.   We try 4, since 32 divided by 8 is 4. Multiply 4 and 8. Subtract 32 from 35. Since the remainder 3 is less than the divisor 8, we are done with the 32 division.   The quotient is expressed as a mixed number. The process was to divide, multiply, and subtract.
