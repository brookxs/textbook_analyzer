Definition of a Linear Inequality A linear inequality A mathematical statement relating a linear expression as either less than or greater than another. is a mathematical statement that relates a linear expression as either less than or greater than another. The following are some examples of linear inequalities, all of which are solved in this section: A solution to a linear inequality A real number that produces a true statement when its value is substituted for the variable. is a real number that will produce a true statement when substituted for the variable. Linear inequalities have either infinitely many solutions or no solution. If there are infinitely many solutions, graph the solution set on a number line and/or express the solution using interval notation.   Example 1: Are x = − 2 and x = 4 solutions to 3 x + 7 < 16 ? Solution: Substitute the values for x, simplify, and check to see if we obtain a true statement. Answer: x = − 2 is a solution and x = 4 is not.
