Scientific Notation Form We start by defining the form of a number called scientific notation. Scientific notation. A number having the form a× 10b, where b is an integer and 1 ≤ |a| < 10, is said to be in scientific notation. The requirement 1 ≤ |a| < 10 says that the magnitude of a must be a least 1 and less than 10. • The number 12.34× 10−4 is not in scientific notation because |12.34| = 12.34 is larger than 10. • The number −0.95× 103 is not in scientific notation because |− 0.95| = 0.95 is less than 1. • The number 7.58× 10−12 is in scientific notation because |7.58| = 7.58 is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. • The number −1.0× 1015 is in scientific notation because |− 1.0| = 1.0 is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. After contemplating these examples, it follows that a number in scientific no- tation should have exactly one of the digits 1, 2, 3, . . . , 9 before the decimal point. Exactly one, no more, no less. Thus, each of the following numbers is in scientific notation. 4.7× 108, −3.764× 10−1, 3.2× 100, and − 1.25× 10−22 Scientific Notation Form We start by defining the form of a number called scientific notation.
