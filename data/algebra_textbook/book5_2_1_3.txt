Operations that Produce Equivalent Equations In Example 1, we saw that x = 8 was a solution of the equation x − 12 = −4. Indeed, the equations x = 8 and x− 12 = −4 are equivalent equations because both have the same solution sets. In the case of the equation x − 12 = −4, it’s fairly easy to “guess” that the solution is x = 8, but as the equations become more complicated, we will want to know just what operations we can perform on the equation that will not change the solution set. The goal is to start with an equation such as x− 12 = −4, then through a series of steps that do not change the solution, arrive at the solution x = 8. 2.1. SOLVING EQUATIONS: ONE STEP 77 With these thoughts in mind, there are a number of operations that will pro- duce equivalent equations (equations with the same solution set). The first two that we will employ are adding or subtracting the same amount from both sides of an equation. Adding the Same Quantity to Both Sides of an Equation. Adding the same quantity to both sides of an equation does not change the solution set. That is, if a = b, then adding c to both sides of the equation produces the equivalent equation a+ c = b+ c. Subtracting the Same Quantity from Both Sides of an Equation. Subtracting the same quantity to both sides of an equation does not change the solution set. That is, if a = b, then subtracting c from both sides of the equation produces the equivalent equation a− c = b− c. Let’s look at an example where adding the same amount to both sides of the equation produces an equivalent equation that is the solution to the original equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve x− 7 = 12 for x. Solve for x: x− 6 = 4Solution: To undo the effect of subtracting 7, we add 7 to both sides of the equation. x− 7 = 12 Original equation. x− 7 + 7 = 12 + 7 Adding 7 to both sides of the equation produces an equivalent equation. x = 19 On the left, adding 7 “undoes” the effect of subtracting 7 and returns x. On the right, 12 + 7 = 19. Therefore, the solution of the equation is 19. 78 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Check: To check, substitute the solution 19 into the original equation. x− 7 = 12 Original equation. 19− 7 = 12 Substitute 19 for x. 12 = 12 Simplify both sides. The fact that the last line of the check is a true statement guarantees that 19 is a solution of x− 7 = 12.Answer: 10 ! In the solution of Example 4, we use the concept of the “inverse.” If we start with x, subtract 7, then add 7, we are returned to the number x. In symbols, x− 7 + 7 = x. We are returned to x because “subtracting 7” and “adding 7” are inverse operations of one another. That is, whatever one does, the other “undoes.” Next, let’s look at an example where subtracting the same amount from both sides of the equation produces an equivalent equation that is the solution to the original equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Solve x+ 2 3 = 1 2 for x.Solve for x: x+ 1 2 = 3 5 Solution: To undo the effect of adding 2/3, we subtract 2/3 from both sides of the equation. x+ 2 3 = 1 2 Original equation. x+ 2 3 − 2 3 = 1 2 − 2 3 Subtracting 2/3 from both sides produces an equivalent equation. x = 3 6 − 4 6 On the left, subtracting 2/3 “undoes” the effect of adding 2/3 and returns x. On the right, make equivalent fractions with a common denominator. x = −1 6 Subtract: 3 6 − 4 6 = −1 6 Therefore, the solution of the equation is −1/6.
