Reducing Fractions to Lowest Terms First, we define what is meant by the greatest common divisor of two integers. The Greatest Common Divisor. Given two integers a and b, the greatest common divisor of a and b is the largest integer that divides evenly (with no remainder) into both a and b. The notation GCD(a, b) is used to represent the greatest common divisor of a and b. For example, GCD(12, 18) = 6, GCD(32, 40) = 8, and GCD(18, 27) = 9. We can now state when a fraction is reduced to lowest terms. Lowest Terms. A fraction a/b is said to be reduced to lowest terms if and only if GCD(a, b) = 1. A common technique used to reduce a fraction to lowest terms is to divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Reduce 8/12 to lowest terms. Reduce: −48/60 32 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Solution: Note that GCD(8, 12) = 4. Divide both numerator and denomina- tor by 4. 8 12 = 8÷ 4 12÷ 4 Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(8, 12) = 4. = 2 3 Simplify numerator and denominator. Thus, 8/12 = 2/3.Answer: −4/5 ! Recall the definition of a prime number. Prime Number. A natural number greater than one is prime if and only if its only divisors are one and itself. For example, 7 is prime (its only divisors are 1 and 7), but 14 is not (its divisors are 1, 2, 7, and 14). In like fashion, 2, 3, and 5 are prime, but 6, 15, and 21 are not prime. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Reduce 10/40 to lowest terms.Reduce 18/24 to lowest terms. Solution: Note that GCD(10, 40) = 10. Divide numerator and denominator by 10. 10 40 = 10÷ 10 40÷ 10 Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(10, 40) = 10. = 1 4 Simplify numerator and denominator. Alternate solution: Use factor trees to express both numerator and denom- inator as a product of prime factors. 10 2 5 40 4 2 2 10 2 5 Hence, 10 = 2 · 5 and 40 = 2 · 2 · 2 · 5. Now, to reduce 10/40 to lowest terms, replace the numerator and denominator with their prime factorizations, then cancel factors that are in common to both numerator and denominator. 1.3. THE RATIONAL NUMBERS 33 10 40 = 2 · 5 2 · 2 · 2 · 5 Prime factor numerator and denominator. = ! 2 · !5 !2 · 2 · 2 · !5 Cancel common factors. = 1 4 Simplify numerator and denominator. When we cancel a 2 from both the numerator and denominator, we’re actually dividing both numerator and denominator by 2. A similar statement can be made about canceling the 5. Canceling both 2 and a 5 is equivalent to dividing both numerator and denominator by 10. This explains the 1 in the numerator when all factors cancel. Answer: 3/4 ! Example 2 demonstrates an important point. When all factors cancel. When all of the factors cancel in either numerator or denominator, the resulting numerator or denominator is equal to one.
