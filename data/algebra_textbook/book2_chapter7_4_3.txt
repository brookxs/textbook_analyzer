Method 2: Simplify Using the LCD An alternative method for simplifying complex rational expressions involves clearing the fractions by multiplying the expression by a special form of 1. In this method, multiply the numerator and denominator by the least common denominator (LCD) of all given fractions.   Example 5: Simplify: 1 2 + 1 x 1 4 − 1 x 2 . Solution: Step 1: Determine the LCD of all the fractions in the numerator and denominator. In this case, the denominators of the given fractions are 2, x , 4, and x 2 . Therefore, the L C D  is  4 x 2 . Step 2: Multiply the numerator and denominator by the LCD. This step should clear the fractions in both the numerator and denominator. This leaves us with a single algebraic fraction with a polynomial in the numerator and in the denominator. Step 3: Factor the numerator and denominator completely. Step 4: Cancel all common factors. Answer: 2 x x − 2 Note This was the same problem that we began this section with, and the results here are the same. It is worth taking the time to compare the steps involved using both methods on the same problem.   Example 6: Simplify:   1 − 2 x − 15 x 2     3 − 14 x − 5 x 2 . Solution: Considering all of the denominators, we find that the LCD is  x 2 . Therefore, multiply the numerator and denominator by x 2 : At this point, we have a rational expression that can be simplified by factoring and then canceling the common factors. Answer: x + 3 3 x + 1   It is important to point out that multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same nonzero factor is equivalent to multiplying by 1 and does not change the problem. Because x 2 x 2 = 1 , we can multiply the numerator and denominator by x 2 in the previous example and obtain an equivalent expression.   Example 7: Simplify:   1 x + 1 + 3 x − 3   2 x − 3 − 1 x + 1 . Solution: The LCM of all the denominators is ( x + 1 ) ( x − 3 ) . Begin by multiplying the numerator and denominator by these factors. Answer: 4 x x + 5   Try this!
