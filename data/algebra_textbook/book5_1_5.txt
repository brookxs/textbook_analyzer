1.5 Algebraic Expressions The associative property of multiplication is valid for all numbers. Associative Property of Multiplication. Let a, b, and c be any numbers. Then: a · (b · c) = (a · b) · c The associative property of multiplication is useful in a number of situations. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify: −3(4y)Simplify: 2(3x) Solution: Currently, the grouping −3(4y) demands that we first multiply 4 and y. However, we can use the associative property of multiplication to regroup, first multiplying −3 and 4. −3(4y) = (−3 · 4)y The associative property of multiplication. = −12y Multiply: −3 · 4 = −12 Thus, −3(4y) = −12y.Answer: 6x ! Let’s look at another example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Simplify: −2(−4xy)Simplify: −3(−8u2) Solution: Currently, the grouping −2(−4xy) demands that we first multiply −4 and xy. However, we can use the associative property of multiplication to regroup, first multiplying −2 and −4. −2(−4xy) = (−2 · (−4))xy The associative property of multiplication. = 8xy Multiply: −2 · (−4) = 8 Thus, −2(−4xy) = 8xy.Answer: 24u2 ! In practice, we can move quicker if we perform the regrouping mentally, then simply write down the answer. For example: −2(−4t) = 8t and 2(−5z2) = −10z2 and − 3(4u3) = −12u3 1.5.

ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 61  || The Distributive Property We now discuss a property that couples addition and multiplication. Consider the expression 2 · (3+ 5). The Rules Guiding Order of Operations require that we first simplify the expression inside the parentheses. 2 · (3 + 5) = 2 · 8 Add: 3 + 5 = 8 = 16 Multiply: 2 · 8 = 16 Alternatively, we can instead distribute the 2 times each term in the parenthe- ses. That is, we will first multiply the 3 by 2, then multiply the 5 by 2. Then we add the results. 2 · (3 + 5) = 2 · 3 + 2 · 5 Distribute the 2. = 6 + 10 Multiply: 2 · 3 = 6 and 2 · 5 = 10 = 16 Add: 6 + 10 = 16 Note that both methods produce the same result, namely 16. This example demonstrates an extremely important property of numbers called the distribu- tive property. The Distributive Property. Let a, b, and c be any numbers. Then: a · (b+ c) = a · b+ a · c That is, multiplication is distributive with respect to addition. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Use the distributive property to expand 2(3x+ 7). Expand: 5(2y + 7) Solution: First distribute the 2 times each term in the parentheses. Then simplify. 2(3x+ 7) = 2(3x) + 2(7) Use the distributive property. = 6x+ 14 Multiply: 2(3x) = 6x and 2(7) = 14 Thus, 2(3x+ 7) = 6x+ 14. Answer: 10y + 35 ! Multiplication is also distributive with respect to subtraction. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Use the distributive property to expand −2(5y − 6). Expand: −3(2z − 7) 62 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Solution: Change to addition by adding the opposite, then apply the dis- tributive property. −2(5y − 6) = −2(5y + (−6)) Add the opposite. = −2(5y) + (−2)(−6) Use the distributive property. = −10y + 12 Multiply: −2(5y) = −10y and (−2)(−6) = 12 Thus, −2(5y − 6) = −10y + 12.Answer: −6z + 21 !  || Speeding Things Up a Bit In Example 4, we changed the subtraction to addition, applied the distributiveSome might prefer to “take their time,” using the technique shown in Examples 3 and 4 until they feel “ready” to move more quickly. property, then several steps later we were finished. However, if you understand that subtraction is really the same as adding the opposite, and if you are willing to do a few steps in your head, you should be able to simply write down the answer immediately following the given problem. If you look at the expression −2(5y − 6) from Example 4 again, only this time think “multiply −2 times 5y, then multiply −2 times −6, then the result is immediate. −2(5y − 6) = −10y + 12 Let’s try this “speeding it up” technique in a couple more examples. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Use the distributive property to expand −3(−2x+ 5y − 12).Expand: −3(−2a+ 3b− 7) Solution: To distribute the −3, we simply think as follows: “−3(−2x) = 6x, −3(5y) = −15y, and −3(−12) = 36.” This sort of thinking allows us to write down the answer immediately without any additional steps. −3(−2x+ 5y − 12) = 6x− 15y + 36 Answer: 6a− 9b+ 21 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Use the distributive property to expand −5(−2a− 5b+ 8).Expand: −4(−x− 2y − 7) Solution: To distribute the −5, we simply think as follows: “−5(−2a) = 10a, −5(−5b) = 25b, and −5(8) = −40.” This sort of thinking allows us to write down the answer immediately without any additional steps. −5(−2a− 5b+ 8) = 10a+ 25b− 40 Answer: 4x+ 8y + 28 ! 1.5. ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 63  || Distributing a Negative Sign Recall that negating a number is equivalent to multiplying the number by −1. Multiplicative Property of Minus One. If a is any number, then: (−1)a = −a This means that if we negate an expression, it is equivalent to multiplying the expression by −1. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Expand −(7x− 8y − 10). Expand: −(−a− 2b+ 11) Solution: First, negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. Then we can change subtraction to addition by “adding the opposite” and use the distribu- tive property to finish the expansion. −(7x− 8y − 10) = −1(7x− 8y − 10) Negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1 = −1(7x+ (−8y) + (−10)) Add the opposite. = −1(7x) + (−1)(−8y) + (−1)(−10) Distribute the −1. = −7x+ 8y + 10 Multiply. Thus, −(7x− 8y − 10) = −7x+ 8y + 10. Answer: a+ 2b− 11 ! While being mathematically precise, the technique of Example 7 can be simpli- fied by noting that negating an expression surrounded by parentheses simply changes the sign of each term inside the parentheses to the opposite sign. Once we understand this, we can simply “distribute the minus sign” and write: −(7x− 8y − 10) = −7x+ 8y + 10 In similar fashion, −(−3a+ 5b− c) = 3a− 5b+ c and −(−3x− 8y + 11) = 3x+ 8y − 11. 64 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS  || Combining Like Terms We can use the distributive property to distribute a number times a sum. a(b+ c) = ab+ ac However, the distributive property can also be used in reverse, to “unmultiply” or factor an expression. Thus, we can start with the expression ab + ac and “factor out” the common factor a as follows: ab+ ac = a(b+ c) You can also factor out the common factor on the right. ac+ bc = (a+ b)c We can use this latter technique to combine like terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Simplify: 7x+ 5xSimplify: 3y + 8y Solution: Use the distributive property to factor out the common factor x from each term, then simplify the result. 7x+ 5x = (7 + 5)x Factor out an x using the distributive property. = 12x Simplify: 7 + 5 = 12 Thus, 7x+ 5x = 12x.Answer: 11y ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Simplify: −8a2 + 5a2Simplify: −5z3 + 9z3 Solution: Use the distributive property to factor out the common factor a2 from each term, then simplify the result. −8a2 + 5a2 = (−8 + 5)a2 Factor out an a2 using the distributive property. = −3a2 Simplify: −8 + 5 = −3 Thus, −8a2 + 5a2 = −3a2.Answer: 4z3 ! Examples 8 and 9 combine what are known as “like terms.” Examples 8 and 9 also suggest a possible shortcut for combining like terms. 1.5. ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 65 Like Terms. Two terms are called like terms if they have identical variable parts, which means that the terms must contain the same variables raised to the same exponents. For example, 2x2y and 11x2y are like terms because they contain identical variables raised to the same exponents. On the other hand, −3st2 and 4s2t are not like terms. They contain the same variables, but the variables are not raised to the same exponents. Consider the like terms 2x2y and 11x2y. The numbers 2 and 11 are called the coefficients of the like terms. We can use the distributive property to combine these like terms as we did in Examples 8 and 9, factoring out the common factor x2y. 2x2y + 11x2y = (2 + 11)x2y = 13x2y However, a much quicker approach is simply to add the coefficients of the like terms, keeping the same variable part. That is, 2 + 11 = 13, so: 2x2y + 11x2y = 13x2y This is the procedure we will follow from now on. You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Simplify: −8w2 + 17w2 Simplify: 4ab− 15ab Solution: These are like terms. If we add the coefficients −8 and 17, we get 9. Thus: −8w2 + 17w2 = 9w2 Add the coefficients and repeat the variable part. Answer: −11ab ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Simplify: −4uv − 9uv Simplify: −3xy − 8xy Solution: These are like terms. If we add −4 and −9, we get −13. Thus: −4uv − 9uv = −13uv Add the coefficients and repeat the variable part. Answer: −11xy ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 12. Simplify: −3x2y + 2xy2 Simplify: 5ab+ 11bc 66 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Solution: These are not like terms. They do not have the same variable parts. They do have the same variables, but the variables are not raised to the same exponents. Consequently, this expression is already simplified as much as possible. −3x2y + 2xy2 Unlike terms. Already simplified. Answer: 5ab+ 11bc ! Sometimes we have more than just a single pair of like terms. In that case, we want to group together the like terms and combine them. You Try It! EXAMPLE 13. Simplify: −8u− 4v − 12u+ 9vSimplify: −3z2 + 4z − 8z2 − 9z Solution: Use the associative and commutative property of addition to change the order and regroup, then combine line terms. −8u− 4v − 12u+ 9v = (−8u− 12u) + (−4v + 9v) Reorder and regroup. = −20u+ 5v Combine like terms. Note that −8u− 12u = −20u and −4v + 9v = 5v. Alternate solution. You may skip the reordering and regrouping step if you wish, simply combining like terms mentally. That is, it is entirely possible to order your work as follows: −8u− 4v − 12u+ 9v = −20u+ 5v Combine like terms. Answer: −11z2 − 5z ! In Example 13, the “Alternate solution” allows us to move more quickly and will be the technique we follow from here on, grouping and combining terms mentally.  || Order of Operations Now that we know how to combine like terms, let’s tackle some more compli- cated expressions that require the Rules Guiding Order of Operations. Rules Guiding Order of Operations. When evaluating expressions, pro- ceed in the following order. 1. Evaluate expressions contained in grouping symbols first. If grouping symbols are nested, evaluate the expression in the innermost pair of grouping symbols first. 1.5. ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 67 2. Evaluate all exponents that appear in the expression. 3. Perform all multiplications and divisions in the order that they appear in the expression, moving left to right. 4. Perform all additions and subtractions in the order that they appear in the expression, moving left to right. You Try It! EXAMPLE 14. Simplify: 4(−3a+ 2b)− 3(4a− 5b) Simplify: −2x− 3(5− 2x)Solution: Use the distributive property to distribute the 4 and the −3, then combine like terms. 4(−3a+ 2b)− 3(4a− 5b) = −12a+ 8b− 12a+ 15b Distribute. = −24a+ 23b Combine like terms. Note that −12a− 12a = −24a and 8b+ 15b = 23b. Answer: 4x− 15 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 15. Simplify: −2(3x− 4y)− (5x− 2y) Simplify: −3(u+ v)− (u− 5v)Solution: Use the distributive property to multiply −2 times 3x − 4y, then distribute the minus sign times each term of the expression 5x−2y. After that, combine like terms. −2(3x− 4y)− (5x− 2y) = −6x+ 8y − 5x+ 2y Distribute. = −11x+ 10y Combine like terms: Note that −6x− 5x = −11x and 8y + 2y = 10y. Answer: −4u+ 2v ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 16. Simplify: −2(x2y − 3xy2)− 4(−x2y + 3xy2) Simplify: 8u2v − 3(u2v + 4uv2)Solution: Use the distributive property to multiply −2 times x2y− 3xy2 and−4 times −x2y + 3xy2. After that, combine like terms. −2(x2y − 3xy2)− 4(−x2y + 3xy2) = −2x2y + 6xy2 + 4x2y − 12xy2 = 2x2y − 6xy2 Note that −2x2y + 4x2y = 2x2y and 6xy2 − 12xy2 = −6xy2. Answer: 5u2v − 12uv2 ! 68 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS When grouping symbols are nested, evaluate the expression inside the in- nermost pair of grouping symbols first. You Try It! EXAMPLE 17. Simplify: −2x− 2 (−2x− 2 [−2x− 2])Simplify: x− 2[−x+ 4(x+ 1)] Solution: Inside the parentheses, we have the expression −2x − 2[−2x − 2]. The Rules Guiding Order of Operations dictate that we should multiply first, expanding −2[−2x− 2] and combining like terms. −2x− 2 (−2x− 2 [−2x− 2]) = −2x− 2 (−2x+ 4x+ 2) = −2x− 2 (2x+ 2) In the remaining expression, we again multiply first, expanding −2(2x+2) and combining like terms. = −2x− 4x− 4 = −6x− 4 Answer: −5x− 8 ! 1.5.
