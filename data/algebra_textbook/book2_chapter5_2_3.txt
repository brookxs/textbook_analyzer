Polynomial Functions Polynomial functions with one variable are functions that can be written in the form where a n is any real number and n is any whole number. Some examples of the different classes of polynomial functions are listed below: Polynomial function Name f ( x ) = 5 Constant function A polynomial function with degree 0. (degree 0) f ( x ) = − 2 x + 1 Linear function A polynomial function with degree 1. (degree 1) f ( x ) = 5 x 2 + 4 x − 3 Quadratic function A polynomial function with degree 2. (degree 2) f ( x ) = x 3 − 1 Cubic function A polynomial function with degree 3. (degree 3) f ( x ) = 4 x 5 + 3 x 4 − 7 Polynomial function Since there are no restrictions on the values for x, the domain of any polynomial function consists of all real numbers.   Example 9: Calculate: f ( 5 ) , given f ( x ) = − 2 x 2 + 5 x + 10 . Solution: Recall that the function notation f ( 5 ) indicates we should evaluate the function when x = 5 . Replace every instance of the variable x with the value 5. Answer: f ( 5 ) = − 15   Example 10: Calculate: f ( − 1 ) , given f ( x ) = − x 3 + 2 x 2 − 4 x + 1 . Solution: Replace the variable x with −1. Answer: f ( − 1 ) = 8   Try this! Given g ( x ) = x 3 − 2 x 2 − x − 4 , calculate g ( − 1 ) . Answer: g ( − 1 ) = − 6 Video Solution Polynomial Functions Polynomial functions with one variable are functions that can be written in the form where a n is any real number and n is any whole number.
