Raising a Product to a Power We frequently have need to raise a product to a power, such as (xy)3. Again, remember the exponent is telling us to write xy as a factor three times, so: (xy)3 = (xy)(xy)(xy) Write xy as a factor three times. = xyxyxy The associative property allows us to group as we please. = xxxyyy The commutative property allows us to change the order as we please. = x3y3 Invoke the exponent definition: xxx = x3 and yyy = y3. However, it is much simpler to note that when you raise a product to a power, you raise each factor to that power. In symbols: (xy)3 = x3y3 The preceding discussion leads us to a fourth law of exponents. Raising a Product to a Power. To raise a product to a power, raise each factor to that power. In symbols: (ab)n = anbn You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Simplify each of the following expressions: Simplify: (−2b)4 (a) (yz)5 (b) (−2x)3 (c) (−3y)2 Solution: In each example we are raising a product to a power. Hence, in each case, we raise each factor to that power. (a) (yz)5 = y5z5 (b) (−2x)3 = (−2)3x3 = −8x3 (c) (−3y)2 = (−3)2y2 = 9y2 With a little practice, each of the examples can be simplified mentally. Raise each factor to the indicated power in your head: (yz)5 = y5z5, (−2x)3 = −8x3, and (−3y)2 = 9y2 Answer: 16b4 ! When raising a product of three factors to a power, it is easy to show that we should raise each factor to the indicated power. For example, (abc)3 = a3b3c3. In general, this is true regardless of the number of factors. When raising a product to a power, raise each of the factors to the indicated power. 350 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Simplify: (−2a3b2)3Simplify: (−3xy4)5 Solution: Raise each factor to the third power, then simplify. (−2a3b2)3 = (−2)3(a3)3(b2)3 Raise each factor to the third power. = −8a9b6 Simplify: (−2)3 = 8. In the remaining factors, raising a power to a power requires that we multiply the exponents. Answer: −243x5y20 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Simplify: (−2x2y)2(−3x3y)Simplify: (−a3b2)3(−2a2b4)2 Solution: In the first grouped product, raise each factor to the second power. (−2x2y)2(−3x3y) = ((−2)2(x2)2y2)(−3x3y) Raise each factor in the first grouped product to the second power. = (4x4y2)(−3x3y) Simplify: (−2)2 = 4 and (x2)2 = x4. The associative and commutative property allows us to multiply all six factors in the order that we please. Hence, we’ll multiply 4 and −3, then x4 and x3, and y2 and y, in that order. In this case, we repeat the base and add the exponents. = −12x7y3 Simplify: (4)(−3) = −12. Also, x4x3 = x7 and y2y = y3. Answer: −4a13b14 !
