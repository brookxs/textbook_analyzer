Use completing the square to help solve x2 = 2x+ 2.Use completing the square to help solve x2 = 3− 6x. Solution: First, move 2x to the left-hand side of the equation, keeping the constant 2 on the right-hand side of the equation. x2 − 2x = 2 On the left, take one-half of the coefficient of x: (1/2)(−2) = −1. Square the result: (−1)2 = 1. Add this result to both sides of the equation. x2 − 2x+ 1 = 2 + 1 x2 − 2x+ 1 = 3 We can now factor the left-hand side as a perfect square trinomial. (x− 1)2 = 3 Now, as in Examples 1, 2, and 3, we can take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember, there are two square roots. x− 1 = ±√3 Finally, add 1 to both sides of the equation. x = 1±√3 Thus, the equation x2 = 2x+ 2 has two answers, x = 1−√3 and x = 1+√3. Check: Let’s use the calculator to check the solutions. First, store 1−√3 in X (see the image on the left in Figure 8.11). Then enter the left- and right-hand sides of the equation x2 = 2x + 2 and compare the results (see the image on the left in Figure 8.11). In similar fashion, check the second answer 1 + √ 3 (see the image on the right in Figure 8.11). Figure 8.11: Checking 1−√3 and 1 +√3 in the equation x2 = 2x+ 2. In both cases, note that the left- and right-hand sides of x2 = 2x+2 produce the same result. Hence, both 1−√3 and 1+√3 are valid solutions of x2 = 2x+2. Answer: −3 + 2√3, −3− 2√3 ! 8.3.
