The Reason For Building Rational Expressions Building Rational Expressions Normally, when we write a rational expression, we write it in reduced form. The reason for building rational expressions is to make addition and subtraction of rational expressions convenient (simpler). To add or subtract two or more rational expressions they must have the same denominator. Building rational expressions allows us to transform fractions into fractions with the same denominators (which we can then add or subtract). The most convenient new denominator is the least common denominator (LCD) of the given fractions.
