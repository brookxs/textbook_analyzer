Definition of Subtraction We know from experience with arithmetic that the subtraction 5 – 2 produces 3, that is 5 – 2 = 3. We can suggest a rule for subtracting signed numbers by illus­trating this process on the number line. Begin at 0, the origin. Since 5 is positive, move 5 units to the right. Then, move 2 units to the left to get to 6. (This reminds us of addition with a negative number.) From this illustration we can see that 5 – 2 is the same as 5 + ( – 2). This leads us directly to the definition of subtraction. Definition of Subtraction If a and b are real numbers, a – b is the same as a + ( – b), where – b is the opposite of b .
