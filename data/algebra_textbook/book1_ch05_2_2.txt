Types of Equations Identity Some equations are always true. These equations are called identities. Identities are equations that are true for all acceptable values of the variable, that is, for all values in the domain of the equation. 5x = 5x is true for all acceptable values of x . y + 1 = y + 1 is true for all acceptable values of y .2 + 5 = 7 is true, and no substitutions are necessary. Contradiction Some equations are never true. These equations are called contradictions. Contradictions are equations that are never true regardless of the value substituted for the variable. x = x + 1 is never true for any acceptable value of x . 0  ·  k = 14 is never true for any acceptable value of k . 2 = 1 is never true. Conditional Equation The truth of some equations is conditional upon the value chosen for the variable. Such equations are called conditional equations. Conditional equations are equations that are true for at least one replacement of the variable and false for at least one replacement of the variable. x + 6 = 11 is true only on the condition that x = 5. y − 7 = − 1 is true only on the condition that y = 6 .
