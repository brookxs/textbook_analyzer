The Addition Process We'll study the process of addition by considering the sum of 25 and 43. We write this as 68. We can suggest the following procedure for adding whole numbers using this example. Example 1.20. The Process of Adding Whole Numbers To add whole numbers, The process: Write the numbers vertically, placing corresponding positions in the same column. Add the digits in each column. Start at the right (in the ones position) and move to the left, placing the sum at the bottom. Caution Confusion and incorrect sums can occur when the numbers are not aligned in columns properly. Avoid writing such additions as Sample Set A Example 1.21.  Add 276 and 103. Example 1.22.  Add 1459 and 130 In each of these examples, each individual sum does not exceed 9. We will examine individual sums that exceed 9 in the next section. Practice Set A Perform each addition. Show the expanded form in problems 1 and 2. Exercise 1.5.1. (Go to Solution) Add 63 and 25. Exercise 1.5.2. (Go to Solution) Add 4,026 and 1,501. Exercise 1.5.3. (Go to Solution) Add 231,045 and 36,121.
