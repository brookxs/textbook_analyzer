Multiplication Statements Statement, Multiplication Statement A statement is a sentence that is either true or false. A mathematical statement of the form product = (factor 1) ⋅ (factor 2) is a multiplication statement. Depending on the numbers that are used, it can be either true or false. Omitting exactly one of the three numbers in the statement will produce exactly one of the following three problems. For convenience, we'll represent the omitted (or missing) number with the letter M (M for Missing). M = (factor 1) ⋅ (factor 2) Missing product statement. M ⋅ (factor 2) = product Missing factor statement. (factor 1) ⋅ M = product Missing factor statement. We are interested in developing and working with methods to determine the missing number that makes the statement true. Fundamental to these methods is the ability to translate two words to mathematical symbols. The word of translates to times is translates to equals Multiplication Statements Statement, Multiplication Statement A statement is a sentence that is either true or false.
