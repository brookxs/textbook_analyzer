Adding and Subtracting Rational Functions We can simplify sums or differences of rational functions using the techniques learned in this section. The restrictions of the result consist of the restrictions to the domains of each function.   Example 12: Calculate , given and , and state the restrictions. Solution: Here the domain of f consists of all real numbers except −3, and the domain of g consists of all real numbers except 2. Therefore, the domain of f + g consists of all real numbers except −3 and 2. Answer: , where   Example 13: Calculate , given and , and state the restrictions to the domain. Solution: The domain of f consists of all real numbers except 5 and −5, and the domain of g consists of all real numbers except 5. Therefore, the domain of f − g consists of all real numbers except −5 and 5.
