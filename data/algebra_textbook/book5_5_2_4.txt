The Graph of a Polynomial Function One of the most important polynomial functions in all of mathematics and science is the polynomial having degree two. Quadratic polynomial. The second degree polynomial having the form p(x) = ax2 + bx+ c is called a quadratic polynomial. The graph of this polynomial is called a parabola. The parabola is approximately U-shaped. Some open upwards, some open downwards, depending on the sign of the leading term. In Figure 5.12, the leading term of the parabola p(x) = 2x2 − 8x + 6 has positive two as its 314 CHAPTER 5.

In Figure 5.13, the leading term of the parabola p(x) = −2x2− 8x− 6 has negative two as its coefficient, so it opens downward. The sign of the leading term of p(x) = ax2 + bx+ c determines whether the parabola opens up or down. • If a > 0, the parabola opens upward. • If a < 0, the parabola opens downward. The turning point of a parabola has a special name. The vertex of a parabola. The graph of the second degree polynomial p(x) = ax2+bx+c has a single turning point, called the vertex of the parabola. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Use your graphing calculator to sketch the graph of theUse your graphing calculator to sketch the graph of the quadratic polynomial p(x) = 2x2 − 5x− 4. quadratic polynomial p(x) = −3x2 + 12x+ 25. Solution: The degree of the polynomial p(x) = −3x2 + 12x + 25 is two, so it is a quadratic polynomial and its graph is a parabola. Moreover, its leading term has negative three as its coefficient, so we know that the parabola opens downward. Enter y = −3x2 + 12x + 25 as Y1=-3*X∧2+12*X+25 in the Y= menu (see the first image in Figure 5.14), then select 6:ZStandard from the ZOOM menu to produce the third image in Figure 5.14. Note that the graph in Figure 5.14 appears to have the U-shape of a parabola that opens downwards. Its vertex (turning point) is not visible, but one would 5.2.

We need to adjust the WINDOW parameters so that the vertex of the parabola is visible in the viewing screen. After some experimentation, we settle on the parameters shown in the first image in Figure 5.15, then push the GRAPH button to produce the second image in Figure 5.15.

POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS When the degree of the polynomial is larger than two, the number of turning points of the graph might increase. This makes for some very interesting curves. In more advanced courses, such as intermediate and college algebra, you will be introduced to a variety of techniques that will help you determine appropriate viewing windows for the graphs of these higher degree polynomials. However, in this introductory section, we will assist you by suggesting a good viewing window for each polynomial, one that will allow you to see all of the turning points of the graph of the polynomial.
