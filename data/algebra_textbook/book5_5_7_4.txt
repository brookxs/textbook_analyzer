An Application In Example 7 on page 348, we found the area of the outer square by summing the areas of its parts (see Figure 5.42). Recall that the answer was A = x2 + 6x+ 9. x 3 x 3 Figure 5.42: Find the area of the square. Now that we have the squaring a binomial shortcut, we can simplify the process of finding the area of the outer square by squaring its side. That is: A = (x+ 3)2 5.7. SPECIAL PRODUCTS 379 Now we can use the squaring the binomial technique to expand. = x2 + 2(x)(3) + (3)2 = x2 + 6x+ 9 Note that this is the same as the answer found by summing the four parts of the square in Example 7. 380 CHAPTER 5.
