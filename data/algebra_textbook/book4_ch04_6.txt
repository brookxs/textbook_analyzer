 || Reciprocals Reciprocals Two numbers whose product is 1 are called reciprocals of each other. Sample Set A The following pairs of numbers are reciprocals. Example 4.46.  Example 4.47.  Example 4.48.  Notice that we can find the reciprocal of a nonzero number in fractional form by inverting it (exchanging positions of the numerator and denominator). Practice Set A Find the reciprocal of each number. Exercise 4.6.1. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.6.2. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.6.3. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.6.4. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.6.5. (Go to Solution) Hint Write this number as an improper fraction first. Exercise 4.6.6. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.6.7. (Go to Solution)  || Dividing Fractions Our concept of division is that it indicates how many times one quantity is con­tained in another quantity. For example, using the diagram we can see that there are 6 one-thirds in 2. There are 6 one-thirds in 2. Since 2 contains six 's we express this as Using these observations, we can suggest the following method for dividing a number by a fraction. Dividing One Fraction by Another Fraction To divide a first fraction by a second, nonzero fraction, multiply the first traction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. Invert and Multiply This method is commonly referred to as "invert the divisor and multiply." Sample Set B Perform the following divisions. Example 4.49.  . The divisor is . Its reciprocal is . Multiply by . Example 4.50.  The divisor is . Its reciprocal is . Multiply by . Example 4.51.  . The divisor is . Its reciprocal is . Multiply by . Example 4.52.  . Convert each mixed number to an improper fraction. . . The divisor is . Its reciprocal is . Multiply by . Example 4.53.  . First conveniently write 8 as . The divisor is . Its reciprocal is . Multiply by . Example 4.54.  . The divisor is . Its reciprocal is . Example 4.55.  How many -inch-wide packages can be placed in a box 19 inches wide? The problem is to determine how many two and three eighths are contained in 19, that is, what is ? Convert the divisor to an improper fraction. Write the dividend 19 as . The divisor is . Its reciprocal is . Thus, 8 packages will fit into the box. Practice Set B Perform the following divisions. Exercise 4.6.8. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.6.9. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.6.10.
