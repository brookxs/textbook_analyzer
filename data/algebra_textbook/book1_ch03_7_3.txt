Negative Exponents We can use the idea of reciprocals to find a meaning for negative exponents. Consider the product of x 3 and x − 3 . Assume x ≠ 0 . x 3 ⋅x − 3 = x 3 + ( − 3) = x 0 = 1 Thus, since the product of x 3 and x − 3 is 1, x 3 and x − 3 must be reciprocals. We also know that . (See problem 6 above.) Thus, x 3 and are also reciprocals. Then, since x − 3 and are both reciprocals of x 3 and a real number can have only one reciprocal, it must be that . We have used − 3 as the exponent, but the process works as well for all other negative integers. We make the following definition. If n is any natural number and x is any nonzero real number, then Negative Exponents We can use the idea of reciprocals to find a meaning for negative exponents.
