Multiplying With Like Bases In the expression an, the number a is called the base and the number n isFor those who may be wondering why a0 = 1, provided a != 0, here is a nice argument. First, note that a1 = a, so: a · a0 = a1 · a0 On the right, repeat the base and add the exponents. a · a0 = a1 Or equivalently: a · a0 = a Now, divide both sides by a, which is permissable if a != 0. a · a0 a = a a Simplify both sides: a0 = 1 called the exponent. Frequently, we’ll be required to multiply two exponential expressions with like bases, such as x3 · x4. Recall that the exponent tells us how many times to write each base as a factor, so we can write: x3 · x4 = (x · x · x) · (x · x · x · x) = x · x · x · x · x · x · x = x7 Note that we are simply counting the number of times that x occurs as a factor. First, we have three x’s, then four x’s, for a total of seven x’s. However a little thought tells us that it is much quicker to simply add the exponents to reveal the total number of times x occurs as a factor. x3 · x4 = x3+4 = x7 The preceding discussion is an example of the following general law of expo- nents. Multiplying With Like Bases. To multiply two exponential expressions with like bases, repeat the base and add the exponents. am · an = am+n You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify each of the following expressions:Simplify: 34 · 32 (a) y4 · y8 (b) 23 · 25 (c) (x+ y)2(x+ y)7 Solution: In each example we have like bases. Thus, the approach will be the same for each example: repeat the base and add the exponents. (a) y4 · y8 = y4+8 = y12 (b) 23 · 25 = 23+5 = 28 (c) (x+ y)2(x+ y)7 = (x+ y)2+7 = (x+ y)9 With a little practice, each of the examples can be simplified mentally. Repeat the base and add the exponents in your head: y4 · y8 = y12, 23 · 25 = 28, and (x+ y)2(x+ y)7 = (x+ y)9.Answer: 36 ! 5.5. LAWS OF EXPONENTS 345 You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Simplify: (a6b4)(a3b2) Simplify: (x2y6)(x4y3) Solution: We’ll use the commutative and associative properties to change the order of operation, then repeat the common bases and add the exponents. (a6b4)(a3b2) = a6b4a3b2 The associative property allows us to regroup in the order we prefer. = a6a3b4b2 The commutative property allows us to change the order of multiplication. = a9b6 Repeat the common bases and add the exponents. With practice, we realize that if all of the operators are multiplication, then we can multiply in the order we prefer, repeating the common bases and adding the exponents mentally: (a6b4)(a3b2) = a9b6. Answer: x6y9 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify: xn+3 · x3−2n Simplify: x5−n · x4n+2 Solution: Again, we repeat the base and add the exponents. xn+3 · x3−2n = x(n+3)+(3−2n) Repeat the base, add the exponents. = x6−n Simplify. Combine like terms. Answer: x3n+7 !
