FACTORING Solution: Because there is a power of x larger than one, the equation is nonlinear. Make one side zero. x2 = 2x+ 3 Original equation. x2 − 2x = 3 Subtract 2x from both sides. x2 − 2x− 3 = 0 Subtract 3 from both sides. Compare x2−2x−3 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 1, b = −2 and c = −3. We need an integer pair whose product is ac = −3 and whose sum is b = −2. The integer pair 1 and −3 comes to mind. “Drop” these in place to factor. (x+ 1)(x− 3) = 0 Factor. We have a product that equals zero. Use the zero product property to complete the solution. x+ 1 = 0 or x− 3 = 0 x = −1 x = 3 Thus, the solutions of x2 = 2x+ 3 are x = −1 and x = 3. Graphical solution. Load each side of the equation x2 = 2x + 3 into the Y= menu of your graphing calculator, y = x2 in Y1, y = 2x + 3 in Y2 (see Figure 6.10).
