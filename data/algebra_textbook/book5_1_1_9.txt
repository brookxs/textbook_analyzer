Graphing Calculator: Negating versus Subtracting Consider the view of the lower half of the TI84 graphing calculator in Figure 1.2. Figure 1.2: Lower half of the TI-84. Note that there are two keys that contain some sort of negative sign, one on the bottom row of keys, and another in the last column of keys on the right, positioned just above the plus symbol. (-) and − The first of these buttons is the unary “negation” operator. If you want to negate a single (thus the word “unary”) number, then this is the key to use. For example, enter -3 by pressing the following button sequence. The result is shown in Figure 1.3. (-) 3 ENTER 12 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS The second button is the binary “subtraction” operator. If you want to subtract one number from another number (thus the word “binary”), then this is the key to use. For example, enter 7-15 by pressing the following button sequence. The result is shown in Figure 1.4. 7 − 1 5 ENTER Figure 1.3: Negating a number. Figure 1.4: Subtract two numbers. Important Point. Do not interchange the roles of the unary negation oper- ator and the binary subtraction operator. 1. To negate a number, use: (-) 2. To subtract one number from another, use: − If you interchange the roles of these operators, the calculator will respond that you’ve made a “syntax error” (see Figures 1.5 and 1.6). Figure 1.5: Using the wrong symbol for subtraction. Figure 1.6: The resulting syntax er- ror. You Try It! EXAMPLE 12. Use the TI84 graphing calculator to simplify each of theUse the graphing calculator to evaluate (−225)3. following expressons: (a) −717− 432 (b) (232)(−313) (c) (−17)3 1.1. AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INTEGERS 13 Solution: The minus sign in each of these examples looks exactly the same, but sometimes it is used as a “negative” sign and sometimes it is used as a “subtraction” sign. a) The expression −717 − 432 asks us to subtract 432 from “negative” 717. Enter the following sequence of keystrokes to produce the result shown in the first image in Figure 1.7. (-) 7 1 7 − 4 3 2 ENTER Hence, −717− 432 = −1149. b) The expression (232)(−313) asks us to find the product of 232 and “nega- tive” 313. Enter the following sequence of keystrokes to produce the result shown in the second image in Figure 1.7. 2 3 2 × (-) 3 1 3 ENTER Hence, (232)(−313) = −72616. c) The expression (−17)3 asks us to raise “negative” to the third power. Enter the following sequence of keystrokes to produce the result shown in the third image in Figure 1.7. The “caret” symbol ∧ is located just above the division key in the rightmost column of the TI84 graphing calculator. ( (-) 1 7 ) ∧ 3 ENTER Hence, (−17)3 = −4913.
