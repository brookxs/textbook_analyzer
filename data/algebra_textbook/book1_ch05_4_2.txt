Combining Techniques in Equation Solving In Sections Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 we worked with techniques that involved the use of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to solve equations. We can combine these techniques to solve more complicated equations. To do so, it is helpful to recall that an equation is solved for a particular variable when all other numbers and/or letters have been disassociated from it and it is alone on one side of the equal sign. We will also note that To associate numbers and letters we use the order of operations. Multiply/divide Add/subtract To undo an association between numbers and letters we use the order of operations in reverse.
