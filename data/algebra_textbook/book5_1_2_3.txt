Nested Grouping Symbols When grouping symbols are nested, the Rules Guiding Order of Operations tell us to evaluate the innermost expressions first. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Simplify: −3− 4[−3− 4(−3− 4)]Simplify: −2− 2[−2− 2(−2− 2)] Solution. The Rules Guiding Order of Operations require that we first ad- dress the expression contained in the innermost grouping symbols. That is, we evaluate the expression contained inside the brackets first. −3− 4[−3− 4(−3− 4)] = −3− 4[−3− 4(−3 + (−4))] Add the opposite. = −3− 4[−3− 4(−7)] Add: −3 + (−4) = −7 Next, we evaluate the expression contained inside the brackets. = −3− 4[−3− (−28)] Multiply: 4(−7) = −28 = −3− 4[−3 + 28] Add the opposite. = −3− 4[25] Add: −3 + 28 = 25 Now we multiply, then subtract. 1.2. ORDER OF OPERATIONS 21 = −3− 100 Multiply: 4{25} = 100 = −3 + (−100) Add the opposite. = −103 Add: −3 + (−100) = −103 Thus, −3− 4[−3− 4(−3− 4)] = −103. Answer: −14 !
