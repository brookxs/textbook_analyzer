Function Definition A function is a very special type of relation. Function A relation is a function if and only if each object in the domain is paired with exactly one object in the range. As a first example, consider the relation R = {(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6)} whose mapping diagram is pictured in Figure 5.2. Note that 0 in the domain is paired with two objects, 3 and 4, in the range. Hence, relation R is is not a function. As a second example, consider the relation T = {(5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 4)}, whose mapping diagram is pictured in Figure 5.3. In this example, each domain object is paired with exactly one range object: 5 only gets sent to 3, 6 only gets sent to 3, and 7 only gets sent to 4. Hence, the relation T is a function. The fact that the range object 3 is used twice does not matter. It’s the fact that each domain object gets sent to exactly one range object that matters. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4.

POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Solution: The graph in Figure 5.4 consists of the points A(1, 1), B(2, 2), C(3, 2), D(3, 3), and E(4, 4). The domain is D = {1, 2, 3, 4} and the range is R = {1, 2, 3, 4}. A mapping diagram (see Figure 5.5) will help us decide if the relation represented by the graph is a function. Put the domain on the left, the range on the right, then use arrows to indicate the ordered pairs. Let’s call the relation f . f 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 Figure 5.5: A mapping diagram for the relation f depicted in Figure 5.4. In Figure 5.5, note how the domain object 3 is “sent to” or paired with two range objects, 2 and 3. Hence, the relation f is not a function.Answer: Yes, the relation is a function. ! You Try It!
