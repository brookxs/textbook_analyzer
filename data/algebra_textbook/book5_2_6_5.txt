Reversing the Inequality Sign Up to this point, it seems that the technique for solving inequalities is pretty much identical to the technique used to solve equations. However, in this section we are going to encounter one exception. Suppose we start with the valid inequality −2 < 5, then we multiply both sides by 2, 3, and 4. −2 < 5 −2 < 5 −2 < 5 2(−2) < 2(5) 3(−2) < 3(5) 4(−2) < 4(5) −4 < 10 −6 < 15 −8 < 20 Note that in each case, the resulting inequality is still valid. Caution! We’re about to make an error! Start again with −2 < 5, but this time multiply both sides by −2, −3, and −4. −2 < 5 −2 < 5 −2 < 5 −2(−2) < −2(5) −3(−2) < −3(5) −4(−2) < −4(5) 4 < −10 6 < −15 8 < −20 142 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Note that in each of the resulting inequalities, the inequality symbol is pointing the wrong way! When you multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you mustSome readers might prefer a more formal reason as to why we reverse the inequality when we multiply both sides by a negative number. Suppose that a < b. Then, subtracting b from both sides gives the result a− b < 0. This means that a− b is a negative number. Now, if c is a negative number, then the product (a− b)c is positive. Then: (a− b)c > 0 ac− bc > 0 ac− bc+ bc > 0 + bc ac > bc Thus, if you start with a < b and c < 0, then ac > bc. reverse the inequality sign. Starting with −2 < 5, multiply both sides by −2, −3, and −4, but reverse the inequality symbol. −2 < 5 −2 < 5 −2 < 5 −2(−2) > −2(5) −3(−2) > −3(5) −4(−2) > −4(5) 4 > −10 6 > −15 8 > −20 Note that each of the resulting inequalities is now a valid inquality. Multiplying or Dividing by a Negative Number. Let a and b be real numbers with a < b. If c is a real negative number, then ac > bc and a c > b c . That is, when multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you must reverse the inequality sign. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Solve for x: −2x < 4. Sketch the solution on the real line,Use interval notation to describe the solution of: −3x ≥ −6 then use set-builder and interval notation to describe your solution. Solution: To “undo” multiplying by −2, divide both sides by −2. Because we are dividing both sides by a negative number, we reverse the inequality sign. −2x < 4 Original inequality. −2x −2 > 4 −2 Divide both sides by −2.Reverse the inequality sign. x > −2 Simplify both sides. Shade the real numbers greater than −2. −2 Using set-builder notation, the solution is {x : x > −2}. Using interval nota- tion, the solution is (−2,∞).Answer: (−∞, 2] ! 2.6.
