Square Roots The square root The number that, when multiplied by itself, yields the original number. of a number is that number that when multiplied by itself yields the original number. For example, 4 is a square root of 16, because 4 2 = 16 . Since ( − 4 ) 2 = 16 , we can say that −4 is a square root of 16 as well. Every positive real number has two square roots, one positive and one negative. For this reason, we use the radical sign   √ to denote the principal (nonnegative) square root The positive square root of a real number, denoted with the symbol   √ . and a negative sign in front of the radical −   √ to denote the negative square root. Zero is the only real number with one square root. If the radicand The expression a within a radical sign, a √ n . , the number inside the radical sign, is nonnegative and can be factored as the square of another nonnegative number, then the square root of the number is apparent. In this case, we have the following property:   Example 1: Find the square root. a. 36 − − √ b. 144 − − − √ c. 0.04 − − − − √ d. 1 9 − − √ Solution: a. 36 − − √ = 6 2 − − √ = 6 b. 144 − − − √ = 12 2 − − − √ = 12 c. 0.04 − − − − √ = ( 0.2 ) 2 − − − − − √ = 0.2 d. 1 9 − − √ = ( 1 3 ) 2 − − − − √ = 1 3   Example 2: Find the negative square root. a. − 4 √ b. − 1 √ Solution: a. − 4 √ = − 2 2 − − √ = − 2 b. − 1 √ = − 1 2 − − √ = − 1 The radicand may not always be a perfect square. If a positive integer is not a perfect square, then its square root will be irrational. For example, 2 √ is an irrational number and can be approximated on most calculators using the square root button. Next, consider the square root of a negative number. To determine the square root of −9, you must find a number that when squared results in −9: However, any real number squared always results in a positive number: The square root of a negative number is currently left undefined. For now, we will state that − 9 − − − √ is not a real a number.
