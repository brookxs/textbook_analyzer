 ||  || Denominate Numbers and Pure Numbers Denominate Numbers, Like and Unlike Denominate Numbers It is often necessary or convenient to compare two quantities. Denominate num­bers are numbers together with some specified unit. If the units being compared are alike, the denominate numbers are called like denominate numbers. If units are not alike, the numbers are called unlike denominate numbers. Examples of denominate numbers are shown in the diagram: Pure Numbers Numbers that exist purely as numbers and do not represent amounts of quantities are called pure numbers. Examples of pure numbers are 8, 254, 0, , , and 0.07. Numbers can be compared in two ways: subtraction and division. Comparing Numbers by Subtraction and Division Comparison of two numbers by subtraction indicates how much more one number is than another. Comparison by division indicates how many times larger or smaller one number is than another. Comparing Pure or Like Denominate Numbers by Subtraction Numbers can be compared by subtraction if and only if they both are like denominate numbers or both pure numbers. Sample Set A Example 7.1.  Compare 8 miles and 3 miles by subtraction. 8 mile – 3 miles = 5 miles This means that 8 miles is 5 miles more than 3 miles. Examples of use: I can now jog 8 miles whereas I used to jog only 3 miles. So, I can now jog 5 miles more than I used to. Example 7.2.  Compare 12 and 5 by subtraction. 12 − 5 = 7 This means that 12 is 7 more than 5. Example 7.3.  Comparing 8 miles and 5 gallons by subtraction makes no sense. 8 miles – 5 gallons = ? Example 7.4.  Compare 36 and 4 by division. 36 ÷ 4 = 9 This means that 36 is 9 times as large as 4. Recall that 36÷4 = 9 can be expressed as . Example 7.5.  Compare 8 miles and 2 miles by division. This means that 8 miles is 4 times as large as 2 miles. Example of use: I can jog 8 miles to your 2 miles. Or, for every 2 miles that you jog, I jog 8. So, I jog 4 times as many miles as you jog. Notice that when like quantities are being compared by division, we drop the units. Another way of looking at this is that the units divide out (cancel). Example 7.6.  Compare 30 miles and 2 gallons by division. Example of use: A particular car goes 30 miles on 2 gallons of gasoline. This is the same as getting 15 miles to 1 gallon of gasoline. Notice that when the quantities being compared by division are unlike quantities, we do not drop the units. Practice Set A Make the following comparisons and interpret each one. Exercise 7.2.1. (Go to Solution) Compare 10 diskettes to 2 diskettes by subtraction: division: Exercise 7.2.2. (Go to Solution) Compare, if possible, 16 bananas and 2 bags by subtraction: division:  || Ratios and Rates Ratio A comparison, by division, of two pure numbers or two like denominate numbers is a ratio. The comparison by division of the pure numbers and the like denominate numbers are examples of ratios. Rate A comparison, by division, of two unlike denominate numbers is a rate. The comparison by division of two unlike denominate numbers, such as are examples of rates. Let's agree to represent two numbers (pure or denominate) with the letters a and b . This means that we're letting a represent some number and b represent some, perhaps different, number. With this agreement, we can write the ratio of the two numbers a and b as or The ratio is read as " a to b ." The ratio is read as " b to a ." Since a ratio or a rate can be expressed as a fraction, it may be reducible. Sample Set B Example 7.7.  The ratio 30 to 2 can be expressed as . Reducing, we get . The ratio 30 to 2 is equivalent to the ratio 15 to 1. Example 7.8.  The rate "4 televisions to 12 people" can be expressed as . The meaning of this rate is that "for every 4 televisions, there are 12 people." Reducing, we get . The meaning of this rate is that "for every 1 television, there are 3 people.” Thus, the rate of "4 televisions to 12 people" is the same as the rate of "1 television to 3 people."

(Go to Solution)  ||  || Ratios, Rates, and Proportions Ratio, Rate We have defined a ratio as a comparison, by division, of two pure numbers or two like denominate numbers. We have defined a rate as a comparison, by division, of two unlike denominate numbers. Proportion A proportion is a statement that two ratios or rates are equal. The following two examples show how to read proportions. Sample Set A Write or read each proportion. Example 7.9.  3 is to 5 as 12 is to 20 Example 7.10.  10 items is to 5 dollars as 2 items is to 1 dollar Example 7.11.  8 is to 12 as 16 is to 24. Example 7.12.  50 milligrams of vitamin C is to 1 tablet as 300 milligrams of vitamin C is to 6 tablets. Practice Set A Write or read each proportion. Exercise 7.3.1. (Go to Solution) Exercise 7.3.2.

(Go to Solution) 2 plates are to 1 tray as 20 plates are to 10 trays.  || Finding the Missing Factor in a Proportion Many practical problems can be solved by writing the given information as propor­tions. Such proportions will be composed of three specified numbers and one unknown number. It is customary to let a letter, such as x , represent the unknown number. An example of such a proportion is This proportion is read as " x is to 4 as 20 is to 16." There is a method of solving these proportions that is based on the equality of fractions. Recall that two fractions are equivalent if and only if their cross products are equal. For example, Notice that in a proportion that contains three specified numbers and a letter representing an unknown quantity, that regardless of where the letter appears, the following situation always occurs. We recognize this as a multiplication statement. Specifically, it is a missing factor statement. (See Section 4.7 for a discussion of multiplication statements.) For example, Each of these statements is a multiplication statement. Specifically, each is a missing factor statement. (The letter used here is x , whereas M was used in Section 4.7.) Finding the Missing Factor in a Proportion The missing factor in a missing factor statement can be determined by dividing the product by the known factor, that is, if x represents the missing factor, then x = ( product ) ÷ ( known factor ) Sample Set B Find the unknown number in each proportion. Example 7.13.  . Find the cross product. This mean that , or 5 is to 4 as 20 is to 16. Example 7.14.  . Find the cross product. This means that , or, 5 is to 4 as 20 is to 6. Example 7.15.  Find the cross product. The means that , or, 16 is to 3 as 64 is to 12. Example 7.16.  Find the cross products. Practice Set B Find the unknown number in each proportion. Exercise 7.3.5. (Go to Solution) Exercise 7.3.6. (Go to Solution) Exercise 7.3.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 7.3.8. (Go to Solution)  || Proportions Involving Rates Recall that a rate is a comparison, by division, of unlike denominate numbers. We must be careful when setting up proportions that involve rates. The form is impor­tant. For example, if a rate involves two types of units, say unit type 1 and unit type 2, we can write or Both cross products produce a statement of the type (unit type 1) ⋅ (unit type 2) = (unit type 1) ⋅ (unit type 2) which we take to mean the comparison Examples of correctly expressed proportions are the following: However, if we write the same type of units on different sides, such as, the cross product produces a statement of the form We can see that this is an incorrect comparison by observing the following example: It is incorrect to write for two reason. The cross product is numerically wrong: (2⋅4 ≠ 3⋅6). The cross product produces the statement “hooks are to hooks as poles are to poles,” which makes no sense.  ||  || The Five-Step Method In Section 7.3 we noted that many practical problems can be solved by writing the given information as proportions. Such proportions will be composed of three specified numbers and one unknown number represented by a letter. The first and most important part of solving a proportion problem is to deter­mine, by careful reading, what the unknown quantity is and to represent it with some letter. The Five-Step Method The five-step method for solving proportion problems: By careful reading, determine what the unknown quantity is and represent it with some letter. There will be only one unknown in a problem. Identify the three specified numbers. Determine which comparisons are to be made and set up the proportion. Solve the proportion (using the methods of Section 7.3). Interpret and write a conclusion in a sentence with the appropriate units of measure. Step 1 is extremely important. Many problems go unsolved because time is not taken to establish what quantity is to be found. When solving an applied problem, always begin by determining the unknown quantity and representing it with a letter.  || Problem Solving Sample Set A Example 7.17.  On a map, 2 inches represents 25 miles. How many miles are represented by 8 inches? Step 1: The unknown quantity is miles. Let x = number of miles represented by 8 inches Step 2: The three specified numbers are 2 inches 25 miles 8 inches Step 3: The comparisons are 2 inches to 25 miles → 8 inches to x miles → Proportions involving ratios and rates are more readily solved by suspending the units while doing the computations. Step 4: In step 1, we let x represent the number of miles. So, x represents 100 miles. Step 5: If 2 inches represents 25 miles, then 8 inches represents 100 miles. Try Exercise 7.4.1. in the section called “Practice Set A”. Example 7.18.  An acid solution is composed of 7 parts water to 2 parts acid. How many parts of water are there in a solution composed of 20 parts acid? Step 1: The unknown quantity is the number of parts of water. Let n = number of parts of water. Step 2: The three specified numbers are 7 parts water 2 parts acid 20 parts acid Step 3: The comparisons are 7 parts water to 2 parts acid → n parts water to 20 parts acid → Step 4: In step 1 we let n represent the number of parts of water. So, n represents 70 parts of water. Step 5: 7 parts water to 2 parts acid indicates 70 parts water to 20 parts acid. Try in the section called “Practice Set A”. Example 7.19.  A 5-foot girl casts a -foot shadow at a particular time of the day. How tall is a person who casts a 3-foot shadow at the same time of the day? Step 1: The unknown quantity is the height of the person. Let h = height of the person. Step 2: The three specified numbers are 5 feet ( height of girl) feet (length of shadow) 3 feet (length of shadow) Step 3: The comparisons are 5-foot girl is to foot shadow → h-foot person is to 3-foot shadow → Step 4: Step 5: A person who casts a 3-foot shadow at this particular time of the day is feet tall. Try Exercise 7.4.3. in the section called “Practice Set A”. Example 7.20.  The ratio of men to women in a particular town is 3 to 5. How many women are there in the town if there are 19,200 men in town? Step 1: The unknown quantity is the number of women in town. Let x = number of women in town. Step 2: The three specified numbers are 3 5 19,200 Step 3: The comparisons are 3 men to 5 women → 19,200 men to x women → Step 4: Step 5: There are 32,000 women in town. Example 7.21.  The rate of wins to losses of a particular baseball team is . How many games did this team lose if they won 63 games? Step 1: The unknown quantity is the number of games lost. Let n = number of games lost. Step 2: Since → means 9 wins to 2 losses, the three specified numbers are 9 (wins) 2 (losses) 63 (wins) Step 3: The comparisons are 9 wins to 2 losses→ 63 wins to n losses → Step 4: Step 5: This team had 14 losses.

Step 1: Step 2: Step 3: Step 4: Step 5:  ||  || Ratios and Percents Ratio, Percent We defined a ratio as a comparison, by division, of two pure numbers or two like denominate numbers. A most convenient number to compare numbers to is 100. Ratios in which one number is compared to 100 are called percents. The word percent comes from the Latin word "per centum." The word "per" means "for each" or "for every," and the word "centum" means "hundred." Thus, we have the following definition. Percent means “for each hundred," or "for every hundred." The symbol % is used to represent the word percent. Sample Set A Example 7.22.  The ratio 26 to 100 can be written as 26%. We read 26% as "twenty-six percent." Example 7.23.  The ratio can be written as 165%. We read 165% as "one hundred sixty-five percent." Example 7.24.  The percent 38% can be written as the fraction . Example 7.25.  The percent 210% can be written as the fraction or the mixed number or 2.1. Example 7.26.  Since one dollar is 100 cents, 25 cents is of a dollar. This implies that 25 cents is 25% of one dollar. Practice Set A Exercise 7.5.1. (Go to Solution) Write the ratio 16 to 100 as a percent. Exercise 7.5.2. (Go to Solution) Write the ratio 195 to 100 as a percent. Exercise 7.5.3. (Go to Solution) Write the percent 83% as a ratio in fractional form. Exercise 7.5.4. (Go to Solution) Write the percent 362% as a ratio in fractional form.  || The Relationship Between Fractions, Decimals, and Percents – Making Conversions Since a percent is a ratio, and a ratio can be written as a fraction, and a fraction can be written as a decimal, any of these forms can be converted to any other. Before we proceed to the problems in the section called “Sample Set B” and the section called “Practice Set B”, let's summarize the conversion techniques. Table 7.1. Conversion Techniques – Fractions, Decimals, Percents To Convert a Fraction To Convert a Decimal To Convert a Percent To a decimal: Divide the numerator by the denominator To a fraction: Read the decimal and reduce the resulting fraction To a decimal: Move the decimal point 2 places to the left and drop the % symbol To a percent: Convert the fraction first to a decimal, then move the decimal point 2 places to the right and affix the % symbol. To a percent: Move the decimal point 2 places to the right and affix the % symbol To a fraction: Drop the % sign and write the number “over” 100. Reduce, if possible. Sample Set B Example 7.27.  Convert 12% to a decimal. Note that The % symbol is dropped, and the decimal point moves 2 places to the left. Example 7.28.  Convert 0.75 to a percent. Note that The % symbol is affixed, and the decimal point moves 2 units to the right. Example 7.29.  Convert to a percent. We see in Example 7.28 that we can convert a decimal to a percent. We also know that we can convert a fraction to a decimal. Thus, we can see that if we first convert the fraction to a decimal, we can then convert the decimal to a percent. or Example 7.30.  Convert 42% to a fraction. or Practice Set B Exercise 7.5.5. (Go to Solution) Convert 21% to a decimal. Exercise 7.5.6. (Go to Solution) Convert 461% to a decimal. Exercise 7.5.7. (Go to Solution) Convert 0.55 to a percent. Exercise 7.5.8.

(Go to Solution) Convert to a percent.  ||  || Conversions Involving Fractions of One Percent Percents such as %, %, %, and %, where 1% has not been attained, are fractions of 1%. This implies that Since "percent" means "for each hundred," and "of" means "times," we have Sample Set A Example 7.31.  Convert % to a fraction. Example 7.32.  Convert % to a decimal. Practice Set A Exercise 7.6.1. (Go to Solution) Convert % to a fraction. Exercise 7.6.2. (Go to Solution) Convert % to a fraction. Exercise 7.6.3. (Go to Solution) Convert % to a fraction.  || Conversions Involving Nonterminating Fractions We must be careful when changing a fraction of 1% to a decimal. The number , as we know, has a nonterminating decimal representation. Therefore, it cannot be expressed exactly as a decimal. When converting nonterminating fractions of 1% to decimals, it is customary to express the fraction as a rounded decimal with at least three decimal places. Converting a Nonterminating Fraction to a Decimal To convert a nonterminating fraction of 1% to a decimal: Convert the fraction as a rounded decimal. Move the decimal point two digits to the left and remove the percent sign. Sample Set B Example 7.33.  Convert % to a three-place decimal. Convert to a decimal. Since we wish the resulting decimal to have three decimal digits, and removing the percent sign will account for two of them, we need to round to one place (2 + 1 = 3). % to one decimal place. Move the decimal point two digits to the left and remove the % sign. We'll need to add zeros to locate the decimal point in the correct location. to 3 decimal places Example 7.34.  Convert % to a four-place decimal. Since we wish the resulting decimal to have four decimal places, and removing the percent sign will account for two, we to round to two places. to two decimal places. Move the decimal point two places to the left and drop the percent sign. to four decimal places. Example 7.35.  Convert % to a decimal rounded to ten thousandths. Since we wish the resulting decimal to be rounded to ten thousandths (four decimal places), and removing the percent sign will account for two, we need to round to two places. to two decimal places. Move the decimal point to the left two places and drop the percent sign. correct to ten thousandths. Practice Set B Exercise 7.6.4. (Go to Solution) Convert % to a three-place decimal. Exercise 7.6.5. (Go to Solution) Convert to a decimal rounded to ten thousandths.  ||  || Base, Percent, and Percentage There are three basic types of percent problems. Each type involves a base, a percent, and a percentage, and when they are translated from words to mathemati­cal symbols each becomes a multiplication statement. Examples of these types of problems are the following: What number is 30% of 50? (Missing product statement.) 15 is what percent of 50? (Missing factor statement.) 15 is 30% of what number? (Missing factor statement.) In problem 1, the product is missing. To solve the problem, we represent the missing product with P . P = 30% ⋅ 50 Percentage The missing product P is called the percentage. Percentage means part, or por­tion. In P = 30% ⋅50, P represents a particular part of 50. In problem 2, one of the factors is missing. Here we represent the missing factor with Q . 15 = Q ⋅ 50 Percent The missing factor is the percent. Percent, we know, means per 100, or part of 100. In 15 = Q ⋅50, Q indicates what part of 50 is being taken or considered. Specifi­cally, 15 = Q ⋅50 means that if 50 was to be divided into 100 equal parts, then Q indicates 15 are being considered. In problem 3, one of the factors is missing. Represent the missing factor with B . 15 = 30% ⋅ B Base The missing factor is the base. Some meanings of base are a source of supply, or a starting place. In 15 = 30% ⋅B , B indicates the amount of supply. Specifically, 15 = 30% ⋅B indicates that 15 represents 30% of the total supply. Each of these three types of problems is of the form ( percentage ) = ( percent ) ⋅ ( base ) We can determine any one of the three values given the other two using the methods discussed in Section 4.7.  || Finding the Percentage Sample Set A Example 7.36.  Thus, 15 is 30% of 50. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.1.. Example 7.37.  Thus, 34.2 is 36% of 95. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.1.. Example 7.38.  A salesperson, who gets a commission of 12% of each sale she makes, makes a sale of $8,400.00. How much is her commission? We need to determine what part of $8,400.00 is to be taken. What part indicates percentage. Thus, the salesperson's commission is $1,008.00. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.2.. Example 7.39.  A girl, by practicing typing on her home computer, has been able to increase her typing speed by 110%. If she originally typed 16 words per minute, by how many words per minute was she able to increase her speed? We need to determine what part of 16 has been taken. What part indicates percentage. Thus, the girl has increased her typing speed by 17.6 words per minute. Her new speed is 16 + 17.6 = 33.6 words per minute. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.3.. Example 7.40.  A student who makes $125 a month working part-time receives a 4% salary raise. What is the student's new monthly salary? With a 4% raise, this student will make 100% of the original salary + 4% of the original salary. This means the new salary will be 104% of the original salary. We need to determine what part of $125 is to be taken. What part indicates percentage. Thus, this student's new monthly salary is $130. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.4.. Example 7.41.  An article of clothing is on sale at 15% off the marked price. If the marked price is $24.95, what is the sale price? Since the item is discounted 15%, the new price will be 100% – 15% = 85% of the marked price. We need to determine what part of 24.95 is to be taken. What part indicates percentage. Thus, the sale price of the item is $21.21. Practice Set A Exercise 7.7.1. (Go to Solution) What number is 42% of 85? Exercise 7.7.2. (Go to Solution) A sales person makes a commission of 16% on each sale he makes. How much is his commission if he makes a sale of $8,500? Exercise 7.7.3.

If he can increase his assembly speed by 35%, by how many parts per hour would he increase his assembly of products? Exercise 7.7.4. (Go to Solution) A computer scientist in the Silicon Valley makes $42,000 annually. What would this scientist's new annual salary be if she were to receive an 8% raise?  || Finding the Percent Sample Set B Example 7.42.  Recall that (missing factor) = (product) ÷ (known factor). Thus, 15 is 30% of 50. Do the section called “Practice Set B”, Exercise 7.7.5.. Example 7.43.  Thus, 4.32 is 6% of 72. Do the section called “Practice Set B”, Exercise 7.7.5.. Example 7.44.  On a 160 question exam, a student got 125 correct answers. What percent is this? Round the result to two decimal places. We need to determine the percent. Thus, this student received a 78% on the exam. Do the section called “Practice Set B”, Exercise 7.7.6.. Example 7.45.  A bottle contains 80 milliliters of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and 30 milliliters of water. What percent of HCl does the bottle contain? Round the result to two decimal places. We need to determine the percent. The total amount of liquid in the bottle is 80 milliliters + 30 milliliters = 110 milliliters . Thus, this bottle contains approximately 73% HCl. Do the section called “Practice Set B”, Exercise 7.7.7.. Example 7.46.  Five years ago a woman had an annual income of $19,200. She presently earns $42,000 annually. By what percent has her salary increased? Round the result to two decimal places. We need to determine the percent. Thus, this woman's annual salary has increased 219%. Practice Set B Exercise 7.7.5.

Example 7.48.  Thus, 56.43 is 33% of 171. Try Exercise 7.7.8. in the section called “Practice Set C”. Example 7.49.  Fifteen milliliters of water represents 2% of a hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution. How many milliliters of solution are there? We need to determine the total supply. The word supply indicates base. Thus, there are 750 milliliters of solution in the bottle. Try Exercise 7.7.9. in the section called “Practice Set C”. Example 7.50.  In a particular city, a sales tax of % is charged on items purchased in local stores. If the tax on an item is $2.99, what is the price of the item? We need to determine the price of the item. We can think of price as the starting place. Starting place indicates base. We need to determine the base. Thus, the price of the item is $46.00. Try Exercise 7.7.10. in the section called “Practice Set C”. Example 7.51.  A clothing item is priced at $20.40. This marked price includes a 15% discount. What is the original price? We need to determine the original price. We can think of the original price as the starting place. Starting place indicates base. We need to determine the base. The new price, $20.40, represents 100% – 15% = 85% of the original price. Thus, the original price of the item is $24.00.
