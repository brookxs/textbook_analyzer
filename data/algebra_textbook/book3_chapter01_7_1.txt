Converting Decimals to Fractions Because all the denominators are powers of 10, it is very easy to add these fractions by finding a common denominator. In this example, the common denominator is 1000, and we get This suggests a general rule for converting a decimal number to its fraction form: Put all the digits over the denominator that corresponds to the last decimal place value. In the number 2.345, the last decimal place value is the thousandths place, so we put the digits 2345 over the denominator 1000. Of course we would usually want to reduce the resulting fraction to its simplest form.
