 || Factors Let’s begin our review of arithmetic by recalling the meaning of multiplication for whole numbers (the counting numbers and zero). Multiplication Multiplication is a description of repeated addition. In the addition 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 the number 7 is repeated as an addend* 4 times. Therefore, we say we have four times seven and describe it by writing 4  ·  7 The raised dot between the numbers 4 and 7 indicates multiplication. The dot directs us to multiply the two numbers that it separates. In algebra, the dot is preferred over the symbol × to denote multiplication because the letter x is often used to represent a number. Thus, 4  ·  7 = 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 Factors and Products In a multiplication, the numbers being multiplied are called factors. The result of a multiplication is called the product. For example, in the multiplication 4  ·  7 = 28 the numbers 4 and 7 are factors, and the number 28 is the product. We say that 4 and 7 are factors of 28. (They are not the only factors of 28. Can you think of others?)Now we know thatThis indicates that a first number is a factor of a second number if the first number divides into the second number with no remainder. For example, since 4  ·  7 = 28 both 4 and 7 are factors of 28 since both 4 and 7 divide into 28 with no remainder.  || Exponential Notation Quite often, a particular number will be repeated as a factor in a multiplication. For example, in the multiplication 7  ·  7  ·  7  ·  7 the number 7 is repeated as a factor 4 times. We describe this by writing 74 . Thus, 7  ·  7  ·  7  ·  7 = 74 The repeated factor is the lower number (the base), and the number recording how many times the factor is repeated is the higher number (the superscript). The superscript number is called an exponent. Exponent An exponent is a number that records how many times the number to which it is attached occurs as a factor in a multiplication.  ||
