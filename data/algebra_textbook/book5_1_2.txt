1.2 Order of Operations The order in which we evaluate expressions can be ambiguous. Take, for ex- ample, the expression −4 + 2 · 8. If we perform the addition first, then we get −16 as a result (the question mark over the equal sign indicates that the result is questionable). −4 + 2 · 8 ?= −2 · 8 ? = −16. On the other hand, if we perform the multiplication first, then we get 12 as a result. −4 + 2 · 8 ?= −4 + 16 ? = 12. So, what are we to do? Of course, grouping symbols would remove the ambiguity. 1.2 Order of Operations The order in which we evaluate expressions can be ambiguous. Take, for ex- ample, the expression −4 + 2 · 8.

The Rules Guiding Order of Operations require that we first eval- uate the expressions contained inside the grouping symbols. −2(3− 4)2 + 5(1− 2)3 = −2(3 + (−4))2 + 5(1 + (−2))3 Add the opposites. = −2(−1)2 + 5(−1)3 Parentheses first: 3 + (−4) = −1 and 1 + (−2) = −1.

THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS  || Absolute Value Bars as Grouping Symbols Like parentheses and brackets, you must evaluate what is inside them first, then take the absolute value of the result. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Simplify: −8− |5− 11|Simplify: −|− 4− 6| Solution. We must first evaluate what is inside the absolute value bars. −8− |5− 11| = −8− |5 + (−11)| Add the opposite. = −8− |− 6| Add: 5 + (−11) = −6. The number −6 is 6 units from zero on the number line. Hence, |− 6| = 6. = −8− 6 Add: |− 6| = 6. = −8 + (−6) Add the opposite. = −14 Add. Thus, −8− |5− 11| = −14.Answer: −10 !  || Nested Grouping Symbols When grouping symbols are nested, the Rules Guiding Order of Operations tell us to evaluate the innermost expressions first.

The Rules Guiding Order of Operations require that we first ad- dress the expression contained in the innermost grouping symbols. That is, we evaluate the expression contained inside the brackets first. −3− 4[−3− 4(−3− 4)] = −3− 4[−3− 4(−3 + (−4))] Add the opposite. = −3− 4[−3− 4(−7)] Add: −3 + (−4) = −7 Next, we evaluate the expression contained inside the brackets. = −3− 4[−3− (−28)] Multiply: 4(−7) = −28 = −3− 4[−3 + 28] Add the opposite. = −3− 4[25] Add: −3 + 28 = 25 Now we multiply, then subtract. 1.2. ORDER OF OPERATIONS 21 = −3− 100 Multiply: 4{25} = 100 = −3 + (−100) Add the opposite. = −103 Add: −3 + (−100) = −103 Thus, −3− 4[−3− 4(−3− 4)] = −103. Answer: −14 !  || Evaluating Algebraic Expressions Variable. A variable is a symbol (usually a letter) that stands for an unknown value that may vary. Let’s add the definition of an algebraic expression. Algebraic Expression. When we combine numbers and variables in a valid way, using operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, the resulting combination of mathematical symbols is called an algebraic expression. Thus, 2a, x+ 5, and y2, being formed by a combination of numbers, variables, and mathematical oper- ators, are valid algebraic expressions. An algebraic expression must be well-formed. For example, 2 +−5x is not a valid expression because there is no term following the plus sign (it is not valid to write +− with nothing between these operators). Similarly, 2 + 3(2 is not well-formed because parentheses are not balanced. In this section we will evaluate algebraic expressions for given values of the variables contained in the expressions. Here are some simple tips to help you be successful. Tips for Evaluating Algebraic Expressions. 22 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS 1. Replace all occurrences of variables in the expression with open paren- theses. Leave room between the parentheses to substitute the given value of the variable. 2.

EXAMPLE 8. Evaluate the expression x2 − 2xy + y2 at x = −3 and y = 2.If x = −2 and y = −1, evaluate x3 − y3. Solution. Following Tips for Evaluating Algebraic Expressions, first replace all occurrences of variables in the expression x2− 2xy+ y2 with open parentheses. Next, substitute the given values of variables (−3 for x and 2 for y) in the open parentheses. x2 − 2xy + y2 = ( )2 − 2( )( ) + ( )2 = (−3)2 − 2(−3)(2) + (2)2 Finally, follow the Rules Guiding Order of Operations to evaluate the resulting expression. x2 − 2xy + y2 Original expression. = ( )2 − 2( )( ) + ( )2 Replace variables with parentheses. = (−3)2 − 2(−3)(2) + (2)2 Substitute −3 for x and 2 for y. = 9− 2(−3)(2) + 4 Evaluate exponents first. = 9− (−6)(2) + 4 Left to right, multiply: 2(−3) = −6 = 9− (−12) + 4 Left to right, multiply: (−6)(2) = −12 = 9 + 12 + 4 Add the opposite. = 25 Add. Thus, if x = −3 and y = 2, then x2 − 2xy + y2 = 25.Answer: −7 !  || Evaluating Fractions If a fraction bar is present, evaluate the numerator and denominator separately according to the Rules Guiding Order of Operations, then perform the division in the final step. 1.2.

Following Tips for Evaluating Algebraic Expressions, first replace all occurrences of variables in the expression (ad− bc)/(a+ b) with open paren- theses. Next, substitute the given values of variables (5 for a, −3 for b, 2 for c, and −4 for d) in the open parentheses. ad− bc a+ b = ( )( )− ( )( ) ( ) + ( ) = (5)(−4)− (−3)(2) (5) + (−3) Finally, follow the Rules Guiding Order of Operations to evaluate the result- ing expression. Note that we evaluate the expressions in the numerator and denominator separately, then divide. ad− bc a+ b = ( )( )− ( )( ) ( ) + ( ) Replace variables with parentheses. = (5)(−4)− (−3)(2) (5) + (−3) Substitute: 5 for a, −3 for b, 2 for c, −4 for d = −20− (−6) 2 Numerator: (5)(−4) = −20, (−3)(2) = −6 Denominator: 5 + (−3) = 2 = −20 + 6 2 Numerator: Add the opposite = −14 2 Numerator: −20 + 6 = −14 = −7 Divide. Thus, if a = 5, b = −3, c = 2, and d = −4, then (ad− bc)/(a+ b) = −7.

Use the graphing calculator to simplify the following expres-Use the graphing calculator to evaluate −2− 2[−2− 2(−2− 2)]. sion. −213− 35[−18− 211(15− 223)] Solution. The first difficulty with this expression is the fact that the graphing calculator does not have a bracket symbol for the purposes of grouping. The calculator has only parentheses for grouping. So we first convert our expression to the following: −213− 35(−18− 211(15− 223)) Note that brackets and parentheses are completely interchangeable. The next difficulty is determining which of the minus signs are negation symbols and which are subtraction symbols. If the minus sign does not appear between two numbers, it is a negation symbol. If the minus sign does appear between two numbers, it is a subtraction symbol. Hence, we enter the following keystrokes on our calculator. The result is shown in Figure 1.8. (-) 2 1 3 − 3 5 × ( (-) 1 8 − 2 1 1 × ( 1 5 − 2 2 3 ) ) ENTER Figure 1.8: Calculating −213− 35[−18− 211(15− 223)]. Thus, −213− 35[−18− 211(15− 223)] = −1, 535, 663.Answer: −14 ! You Try It!

Well, let’s enter the expression 5+5/5+5 in the calculator and see how well we understand the Rules Guiding Order of Operations (see first image in Figure 1.9). Whoa! How did the calculator get 11? The answer is supposed to be 1! Let’s slow down and apply the Rules Guiding Order of Operations to the expression 5+5/5+5. 5 + 5/5 + 5 = 5 + 5 5 + 5 Divide first. = 5 + 1 + 5 Divide: 5 5 = 1. = 11 Add: 5 + 1 + 5 = 11. Aha! That’s how the calculator got 11. 5 + 5/5 + 5 is equivalent to 5 + 5 5 + 5 Let’s change the order of evaluation by using grouping symbols. Note that: (5 + 5)/(5 + 5) = 10/10 Parentheses first. = 1 Divide: 10/10 = 1. That is: (5 + 5)/(5 + 5) is equivalent to 5 + 5 5 + 5 Enter (5+5)(5+5) and press the ENTER key to produce the output shown in the second image in Figure 1.9. Figure 1.9: Calculating 5 + 5 5 + 5 .

To select the letter A, press the ALPHA key, then the MATH key, located in the upper left-hand corner of the calculator (see Figure 1.10). (-) 3 1 2 STO! ALPHA A ENTER Next, store −875 in the variable B with the following keystrokes. To select the letter B, press the ALPHA key, then the APPS key. Figure 1.10: Upper half of the TI84. (-) 8 7 5 STO! ALPHA B ENTER The results of these keystrokes are shown in the first image in Figure 1.11. Now we need to enter the expression |a|− |b|. The absolute value function is located in the MATH menu. When you press the MATH key, you’ll notice submenus MATH, NUM, CPX, and PRB across the top row of the MATH menu. Use the right-arrow key to select the NUM submenu (see the second image in Figure 1.11). Note that abs( is the first entry on this menu. This is the absolute value function needed for this example.
