FACTORING Each of the trinomials in Example 4 is an example of a perfect square trinomial. Perfect square trinomial. If a trinomial a2 + 2ab + b2 is the square of a binomial, as in (a+ b)2, then the trinomial is called a perfect square trinomial. So, how does one recognize a perfect square trinomial? If the first and last terms of a trinomial are perfect squares, then you should suspect that you may be dealing with a perfect square trinomial. However, you also have to have the correct middle term in order to have a perfect square trinomial. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Factor each of the following trinomials:Factor: 16x2 + 72x+ 81 a) 9x2 − 42x+ 49 b) 49a2 + 70ab+ 25b2 c) 4x2 − 37x+ 9 Solution: Note that the first and last terms of each trinomial are perfect squares. a) In the trinomial 9x2−42x+49, note that (3x)2 = 9x2 and 72 = 49. Hence, the first and last terms are perfect squares. Taking the square roots, we suspect that 9x2 − 42x+ 49 factors as follows: 9x2 − 42x+ 49 ?= (3x− 7)2 However, we must check to see if the middle term is correct. Multiply 3x and 7, then double: 2(3x)(7) = 42x. Thus, the middle term is correct and therefore 9x2 − 42x+ 49 = (3x− 7)2. b) In the trinomial 49a2+70ab+25b2, note that (7a)2 = 49a2 and (5b)2 = 25b2. Hence, the first and last terms are perfect squares. Taking the square roots, we suspect that 49a2 + 70ab+ 25b2 factors as follows: 49a2 + 70ab+ 25b2 ? = (7a+ 5b)2 However, we must check to see if the middle term is correct. Multiply 7a and 5b, then double: 2(7a)(5b) = 70ab. Thus, the middle term is correct and therefore 49a2 + 70ab+ 25b2 = (7a+ 5b)2.

Hence, the first and last terms are perfect squares. Taking the square roots, we suspect that 4x2 − 37x+ 9 factors as follows: 4x2 − 37x+ 9 ?= (2x− 3)2 6.5. FACTORING SPECIAL FORMS 443 However, we must check to see if the middle term is correct. Multiply 2x and 3, then double: 2(2x)(3) = 12x. However, this is not the middle term of 4x2 − 37x + 9, so this factorization is incorrect! We must find another way to factor this trinomial. Comparing 4x2 − 37x+ 9 with ax2 + bx+ c, we need a pair of integers whose product is ac = 36 and whose sum is b = −37. The integer pair −1 and −36 comes to mind. Replace the middle term as a sum of like terms using this ordered pair. 4x2 − 37x+ 9 = 4x2 − x− 36x+ 9 −37x = −x− 36x. = x(4x− 1)− 9(4x− 1) Factor by grouping. = (x− 9)(4x− 1) Factor out 4x− 1.

We first factor out 2xy. 2x3y + 12x2y2 + 18xy3 = 2xy(x2 + 6xy + 9y2) We now note that the first and last terms of the resulting trinomial factor are perfect squares, so we take their square roots and factors as follows. = 2xy(x+ 3y)2 Of course, the last factorization is correct only if the middle term is correct. Because 2(x)(3y) = 6xy matches the middle term of x2 +6xy+9y2, we do have a perfect square trinomial and our result is correct. 444 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING b) In the trinomial −4x5 + 32x4 − 64x3, we note that the GCF of 4x5, 32x4, and 64x3 is 4x3. We first factor out 4x3. −4x5 + 32x4 − 64x3 = 4x3(−x2 + 8x− 16) However, the first and third terms of −x2 +8x− 16 are negative, and thus are not perfect squares. Let’s begin again, this time factoring out −4x3. −4x5 + 32x4 − 64x3 = −4x3(x2 − 8x+ 16) This time the first and third terms of x2− 8x+16 are perfect squares. We take their square roots and write: = −4x3(x− 4)2 Again, this last factorization is correct only if the middle term is correct. Because 2(x)(4) = 8x, we do have a perfect square trinomial and our result is correct. Answer: −4x(x+ 3)2 ! Perfect Square Trinomials To square a binomial such as (a+ b)2, proceed as follows: 1.
