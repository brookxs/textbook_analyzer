Multiple Grouping Symbols When a set of grouping symbols occurs inside another set of grouping symbols, we perform the operations within the innermost set first. Sample Set B Determine the value of each of the following. Example 3.11.  2 + ( 8 ⋅ 3 ) − ( 5 + 6 ) Combine 8 and 3 first, then combine 5 and 6. Example 3.12.  10 + [ 30 − ( 2 ⋅ 9 ) ] Combine 2 and 9 since they occur in the innermost set of parentheses. Practice Set B Determine the value of each of the following. Exercise 3.3.7. (Go to Solution) (17 + 8) + (9 + 20) Exercise 3.3.8. (Go to Solution) (55 − 6) − (13⋅2) Exercise 3.3.9. (Go to Solution) 23 + (12÷4) − (11⋅2) Exercise 3.3.10. (Go to Solution) 86 + [14÷(10 − 8)] Exercise 3.3.11. (Go to Solution) 31 + {9 + [1 + (35 − 2)]} Exercise 3.3.12. (Go to Solution) {6 − [24÷(4⋅2)]}3 Multiple Grouping Symbols When a set of grouping symbols occurs inside another set of grouping symbols, we perform the operations within the innermost set first.
