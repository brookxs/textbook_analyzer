 || Geometric Definition of Absolute Value Absolute Value-Geometric Approach Geometric definition of absolute value: The absolute value of a number a , denoted ∣ a ∣ , is the distance from a to 0 on the number line. Absolute value answers the question of "how far," and not "which way." The phrase "how far" implies "length" and length is always a nonnegative quantity. Thus, the absolute value of a number is a nonnegative number. Sample Set A Determine each value. Example 10.14.  ∣ 4 ∣ = 4 Example 10.15.  ∣ − 4 ∣ = 4 Example 10.16.  ∣ 0 ∣ = 0 Example 10.17.  − ∣ 5 ∣ = − 5. The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as "negative the absolute value of 5." The absolute value of 5 is 5. Hence, negative the absolute value of 5 is -5. Example 10.18.  − ∣ − 3 ∣ = − 3. The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as "negative the absolute value of -3." The absolute value of -3 is 3. Hence, negative the absolute value of -3 is – ( 3 ) = – 3 . Practice Set A By reasoning geometrically, determine each absolute value. Exercise 10.4.1. (Go to Solution) ∣ 7 ∣ Exercise 10.4.2.

Note that the definition has two parts. Absolute Value—Algebraic Approach Algebraic definition of absolute value The absolute value of a number a is The algebraic definition takes into account the fact that the number a could be either positive or zero (a ≥ 0) or negative (a < 0). If the number a is positive or zero (a ≥ 0), the upper part of the definition applies. The upper part of the definition tells us that if the number enclosed in the absolute value bars is a nonnegative number, the absolute value of the number is the number itself. The lower part of the definition tells us that if the number enclosed within the absolute value bars is a negative number, the absolute value of the number is the opposite of the number. The opposite of a negative number is a positive number. Note The definition says that the vertical absolute value lines may be elimi­nated only if we know whether the number inside is positive or negative. Sample Set B Use the algebraic definition of absolute value to find the following values. Example 10.19.  ∣ 8 ∣ . The number enclosed within the absolute value bars is a nonnegative number, so the upper part of the definition applies. This part says that the absolute value of 8 is 8 itself. ∣ 8 ∣ = 8 Example 10.20.  ∣ − 3 ∣ . The number enclosed within absolute value bars is a negative number, so the lower part of the definition applies. This part says that the absolute value of -3 is the opposite of -3, which is − ( − 3). By the definition of absolute value and the double-negative property, ∣ − 3 ∣ = − ( − 3 ) = 3 Practice Set B Use the algebraic definition of absolute value to find the following values.
