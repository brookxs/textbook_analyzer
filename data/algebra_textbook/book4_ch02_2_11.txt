Multiplications With Numbers Ending in Zero Often, when performing a multiplication, one or both of the factors will end in zeros. Such multiplications can be done quickly by aligning the numbers so that the rightmost nonzero digits are in the same column. Sample Set D Perform the multiplication (49,000)(1,200). Since 9 and 2 are the rightmost nonzero digits, put them in the same column. Draw (perhaps mentally) a vertical line to separate the zeros from the nonzeros. Multiply the numbers to the left of the vertical line as usual, then attach to the right end of this product the total number of zeros. The product is 58,800,000 Practice Set D Exercise 2.2.20. (Go to Solution) Multiply 1,800 by 90. Exercise 2.2.21. (Go to Solution) Multiply 420,000 by 300. Exercise 2.2.22. (Go to Solution) Multiply 20,500,000 by 140,000.
