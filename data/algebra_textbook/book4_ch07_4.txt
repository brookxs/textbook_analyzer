 || The Five-Step Method In Section 7.3 we noted that many practical problems can be solved by writing the given information as proportions. Such proportions will be composed of three specified numbers and one unknown number represented by a letter. The first and most important part of solving a proportion problem is to deter­mine, by careful reading, what the unknown quantity is and to represent it with some letter. The Five-Step Method The five-step method for solving proportion problems: By careful reading, determine what the unknown quantity is and represent it with some letter. There will be only one unknown in a problem. Identify the three specified numbers. Determine which comparisons are to be made and set up the proportion. Solve the proportion (using the methods of Section 7.3). Interpret and write a conclusion in a sentence with the appropriate units of measure. Step 1 is extremely important. Many problems go unsolved because time is not taken to establish what quantity is to be found. When solving an applied problem, always begin by determining the unknown quantity and representing it with a letter.  || Problem Solving Sample Set A Example 7.17.  On a map, 2 inches represents 25 miles. How many miles are represented by 8 inches? Step 1: The unknown quantity is miles. Let x = number of miles represented by 8 inches Step 2: The three specified numbers are 2 inches 25 miles 8 inches Step 3: The comparisons are 2 inches to 25 miles → 8 inches to x miles → Proportions involving ratios and rates are more readily solved by suspending the units while doing the computations. Step 4: In step 1, we let x represent the number of miles. So, x represents 100 miles. Step 5: If 2 inches represents 25 miles, then 8 inches represents 100 miles. Try Exercise 7.4.1. in the section called “Practice Set A”. Example 7.18.  An acid solution is composed of 7 parts water to 2 parts acid. How many parts of water are there in a solution composed of 20 parts acid? Step 1: The unknown quantity is the number of parts of water. Let n = number of parts of water. Step 2: The three specified numbers are 7 parts water 2 parts acid 20 parts acid Step 3: The comparisons are 7 parts water to 2 parts acid → n parts water to 20 parts acid → Step 4: In step 1 we let n represent the number of parts of water. So, n represents 70 parts of water. Step 5: 7 parts water to 2 parts acid indicates 70 parts water to 20 parts acid. Try in the section called “Practice Set A”. Example 7.19.  A 5-foot girl casts a -foot shadow at a particular time of the day. How tall is a person who casts a 3-foot shadow at the same time of the day? Step 1: The unknown quantity is the height of the person. Let h = height of the person. Step 2: The three specified numbers are 5 feet ( height of girl) feet (length of shadow) 3 feet (length of shadow) Step 3: The comparisons are 5-foot girl is to foot shadow → h-foot person is to 3-foot shadow → Step 4: Step 5: A person who casts a 3-foot shadow at this particular time of the day is feet tall. Try Exercise 7.4.3. in the section called “Practice Set A”. Example 7.20.  The ratio of men to women in a particular town is 3 to 5. How many women are there in the town if there are 19,200 men in town? Step 1: The unknown quantity is the number of women in town. Let x = number of women in town. Step 2: The three specified numbers are 3 5 19,200 Step 3: The comparisons are 3 men to 5 women → 19,200 men to x women → Step 4: Step 5: There are 32,000 women in town. Example 7.21.  The rate of wins to losses of a particular baseball team is . How many games did this team lose if they won 63 games? Step 1: The unknown quantity is the number of games lost. Let n = number of games lost. Step 2: Since → means 9 wins to 2 losses, the three specified numbers are 9 (wins) 2 (losses) 63 (wins) Step 3: The comparisons are 9 wins to 2 losses→ 63 wins to n losses → Step 4: Step 5: This team had 14 losses.
