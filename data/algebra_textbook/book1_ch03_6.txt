 || Multiplication of Signed Numbers Let us consider first the product of two positive numbers. Multiply: 3⋅5 . 3⋅5 means 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 . This suggests that (positive number)⋅(positive number) = positive number . More briefly, ( + )( + ) = + . Now consider the product of a positive number and a negative number. Multiply: (3)( − 5) . (3)( − 5) means ( − 5) + ( − 5) + ( − 5) = − 15 . This suggests that (positive number)⋅(negative number) = negative number More briefly, ( + )( – ) = – . By the commutative property of multiplication, we get (negative number)⋅(positive number) = negative number More briefly, ( – )( + ) = – . The sign of the product of two negative numbers can be determined using the following illustration: Multiply − 2 by, respectively, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0,  − 1,  − 2,  − 3,  − 4 . Notice that when the multiplier decreases by 1, the product increases by 2. We have the following rules for multiplying signed numbers. Rules for Multiplying Signed Numbers To multiply two real numbers that have the same sign, multiply their absolute values. The product is positive. opposite signs, multiply their absolute values. The product is negative.  || Division of Signed Numbers We can determine the sign pattern for division by relating division to multiplication. Division is defined in terms of multiplication in the following way. If b⋅c = a , then . For example, since 3⋅4 = 12 , it follows that . Notice the pattern: Since , it follows that The sign pattern for division follows from the sign pattern for multiplication. Since , it follows that , that is, Since , it follows that , that is, Since , it follows that , that is, Since , it follows that , that is We have the following rules for dividing signed numbers. Rules for Dividing Signed Numbers To divide two real numbers that have the same sign, divide their absolute values. The quotient is positive. opposite signs, divide their absolute values. The quotient is negative.  ||
