Laws of Exponents In the arguments demonstrating that 4−1 = 1/4 and a−n = 1/an, we appealed to one of the laws of exponents learned in Chapter 5, Section 5. Fortunately, the laws of exponents work exactly the same whether the exponents are positive or negative integers. Laws of Exponents. If m and n are integers, then: 1. aman = am+n 2. am an = am−n 3. (am)n = amn 4. (ab)n = anbn 5. (a b )n = an bn You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify each of the following expressions:Simplify: t8 · t−4 a) y5y−7 b) 2−2 · 2−3 c) x−4x6 Solution: In each case, we use the first law of exponents (aman = am+n). Be- cause we are multiplying like bases, we repeat the base and add the exponents. 7.1. NEGATIVE EXPONENTS 481 a) y5y−7 = y5+(−7) = y−2 b) 2−2 · 2−3 = 2−2+(−3) = 2−5 c) x−4x6 = x−4+6 = x2 Answer: t4 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify each of the following expressions: Simplify: y−6 y−2 a) x4 x7 b) 3−4 35 c) z−3 z−5 Solution: In each case, we use the second law of exponents (am/an = am−n). Because we are dividing like bases, we repeat the base and subtract the expo- nents. Recall that subtraction means “add the opposite.” a) x4 x7 = x4−7 = x4+(−7) = x−3 b) 3−4 35 = 3−4−5 = 3−4+(−5) = 3−9 c) z−3 z−5 = z−3−(−5) = z−3+5 = z2 Answer: y−4 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify each of the following expressions: Simplify: (z5)−2 a) (5−2)3 b) (a−3)−4 c) (w2)−7 Solution: In each case, we are using the third law of exponents ((am)n = amn). Because we are raising a power to another power, we repeat the base and multiply the exponents. a) (5−2)3 = 5(−2)(3) = 5−6 b) (a−3)−4 = a(−3)(−4) = a12 c) (w2)−7 = w(2)(−7) = w−14 Answer: z−10 ! 482 CHAPTER 7.
