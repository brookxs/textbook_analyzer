5.5 Laws of Exponents In Chapter 1, section 1, we first introduced the definition of an exponent. For convenience, we repeat that definition. In the exponential expression an, the number a is called the base, while the number n is called the exponent. Exponents. Let a be any real number and let n be any whole number. If n != 0, then: an = a · a · a · · · · · a︸ ︷︷ ︸ n times That is, to calculate an, write a as a factor n times. In the case where a != 0, but n = 0, then we define: a0 = 1 For example, raising a number to the fifth power requires that we repeat the number as a factor five times (see Figure 5.35). (−2)5 = (−2)(−2)(−2)(−2)(−2) = −32 Raising a number to the fourth power requires that we repeat that number as a factor four times (see Figure 5.35).( −1 2 )4 = ( −1 2 )( −1 2 )( −1 2 )( −1 2 ) = 1 16 As a final example, note that 100 = 1, but 00 is undefined (see Figure 5.36).

POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS  || Multiplying With Like Bases In the expression an, the number a is called the base and the number n isFor those who may be wondering why a0 = 1, provided a != 0, here is a nice argument. First, note that a1 = a, so: a · a0 = a1 · a0 On the right, repeat the base and add the exponents. a · a0 = a1 Or equivalently: a · a0 = a Now, divide both sides by a, which is permissable if a != 0. a · a0 a = a a Simplify both sides: a0 = 1 called the exponent. Frequently, we’ll be required to multiply two exponential expressions with like bases, such as x3 · x4. Recall that the exponent tells us how many times to write each base as a factor, so we can write: x3 · x4 = (x · x · x) · (x · x · x · x) = x · x · x · x · x · x · x = x7 Note that we are simply counting the number of times that x occurs as a factor. First, we have three x’s, then four x’s, for a total of seven x’s. However a little thought tells us that it is much quicker to simply add the exponents to reveal the total number of times x occurs as a factor. x3 · x4 = x3+4 = x7 The preceding discussion is an example of the following general law of expo- nents. Multiplying With Like Bases. To multiply two exponential expressions with like bases, repeat the base and add the exponents. am · an = am+n You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify each of the following expressions:Simplify: 34 · 32 (a) y4 · y8 (b) 23 · 25 (c) (x+ y)2(x+ y)7 Solution: In each example we have like bases. Thus, the approach will be the same for each example: repeat the base and add the exponents. (a) y4 · y8 = y4+8 = y12 (b) 23 · 25 = 23+5 = 28 (c) (x+ y)2(x+ y)7 = (x+ y)2+7 = (x+ y)9 With a little practice, each of the examples can be simplified mentally. Repeat the base and add the exponents in your head: y4 · y8 = y12, 23 · 25 = 28, and (x+ y)2(x+ y)7 = (x+ y)9.Answer: 36 ! 5.5. LAWS OF EXPONENTS 345 You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Simplify: (a6b4)(a3b2) Simplify: (x2y6)(x4y3) Solution: We’ll use the commutative and associative properties to change the order of operation, then repeat the common bases and add the exponents. (a6b4)(a3b2) = a6b4a3b2 The associative property allows us to regroup in the order we prefer. = a6a3b4b2 The commutative property allows us to change the order of multiplication. = a9b6 Repeat the common bases and add the exponents. With practice, we realize that if all of the operators are multiplication, then we can multiply in the order we prefer, repeating the common bases and adding the exponents mentally: (a6b4)(a3b2) = a9b6.

Combine like terms. Answer: x3n+7 !  || Dividing With Like Bases Like multiplication, we will also be frequently asked to divide exponential ex- pressions with like bases, such as x7/x4. Again, the key is to remember that the exponent tells us how many times to write the base as a factor, so we can write: x7 x4 = x · x · x · x · x · x · x x · x · x · x· = ! x · !x · !x · !x · x · x · x !x · !x · !x · !x· = x3 Note how we cancel four x’s in the numerator for four x’s in the denominator. However, in a sense we are “subtracting four x’s” from the numerator, so a 346 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS faster way to proceed is to repeat the base and subtract the exponents, as follows:Here is another nice argument why a0 = 1, provided a != 0. Start with: a1 a1 = 1 Repeat the base and subtract the exponents. a1−1 = 1 Simplify. a0 = 1 x7 x4 = x7−4 = x3 The preceding discussion is an example of the second general law of expo- nents. Dividing With Like Bases. To divide two exponential expressions with like bases, repeat the base and subtract the exponents.

Thus, the approach will be the same for each example: repeat the base and subtract the exponents. (a) x12 x3 = x12−3 = x9 (b) 57 57 = 57−7 = 50 = 1 (c) (2x+ 1)8 (2x+ 1)3 = (2x+ 1)8−3 = (2x+ 1)5 With a little practice, each of the examples can be simplified mentally. Repeat the base and subtract the exponents in your head: x12/x3 = x9, 57/54 = 53, and (2x+ 1)8/(2x+ 1)3 = (2x+ 1)5.Answer: 42 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 5.

Combine like terms. Answer: x2n−8 !  || Raising a Power to a Power Suppose we have an exponential expression raised to a second power, such as (x2)3. The second exponent tells us to write x2 as a factor three times: (x2)3 = x2 · x2 · x2 Write x2 as a factor three times. = x6 Repeat the base, add the exponents. Note how we added 2 + 2 + 2 to get 6. However, a much faster way to add “three twos” is to multiply: 3 · 2 = 6. Thus, when raising a “power to a second power,” repeat the base and multiply the exponents, as follows: (x2)3 = x2·3 = x6 The preceding discussion gives rise to the following third law of exponents. 348 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Raising a Power to a Power. When raising a power to a power, repeat the base and multiply the exponents.

(a) (z3)5 = z3·5 = z15 (b) (73)0 = 73·0 = 70 = 1 (c) [(x− y)3]6 = (x − y)3·6 = (x − y)18 With a little practice, each of the examples can be simplified mentally.

Answer: a6−3n ! 5.5. LAWS OF EXPONENTS 349  || Raising a Product to a Power We frequently have need to raise a product to a power, such as (xy)3. Again, remember the exponent is telling us to write xy as a factor three times, so: (xy)3 = (xy)(xy)(xy) Write xy as a factor three times. = xyxyxy The associative property allows us to group as we please. = xxxyyy The commutative property allows us to change the order as we please. = x3y3 Invoke the exponent definition: xxx = x3 and yyy = y3. However, it is much simpler to note that when you raise a product to a power, you raise each factor to that power. In symbols: (xy)3 = x3y3 The preceding discussion leads us to a fourth law of exponents. Raising a Product to a Power. To raise a product to a power, raise each factor to that power.

(a) (yz)5 = y5z5 (b) (−2x)3 = (−2)3x3 = −8x3 (c) (−3y)2 = (−3)2y2 = 9y2 With a little practice, each of the examples can be simplified mentally. Raise each factor to the indicated power in your head: (yz)5 = y5z5, (−2x)3 = −8x3, and (−3y)2 = 9y2 Answer: 16b4 ! When raising a product of three factors to a power, it is easy to show that we should raise each factor to the indicated power. For example, (abc)3 = a3b3c3. In general, this is true regardless of the number of factors. When raising a product to a power, raise each of the factors to the indicated power. 350 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS You Try It!

(−2a3b2)3 = (−2)3(a3)3(b2)3 Raise each factor to the third power. = −8a9b6 Simplify: (−2)3 = 8. In the remaining factors, raising a power to a power requires that we multiply the exponents.

The associative and commutative property allows us to multiply all six factors in the order that we please. Hence, we’ll multiply 4 and −3, then x4 and x3, and y2 and y, in that order. In this case, we repeat the base and add the exponents. = −12x7y3 Simplify: (4)(−3) = −12. Also, x4x3 = x7 and y2y = y3. Answer: −4a13b14 !  || Raising a Quotient to a Power Raising a quotient to a power is similar to raising a product to a power. For example, raising (x/y)3 requires that we write x/y as a factor three times.( x y )3 = x y · x y · x y = x · x · x y · y · y = x3 y3 5.5. LAWS OF EXPONENTS 351 However, it is much simpler to realize that when you raise a quotient to a power, you raise both numerator and denominator to that power. In symbols:( x y )3 = x3 y3 This leads to the fifth and final law of exponents. Raising a Quotient to a Power. To raise a quotient to a power, raise both numerator and denominator to that power.
