Integer Multiplication This section is designed to provide a quick review of multiplication and division of integers. For a more thorough introduction to integer multiplication and division, read section four of chapter two of our prealgebra textbook, provided online at the following URL: http://msenux.redwoods.edu/PreAlgText/contents/chapter2/ chapter2.pdf Like Signs. If a and b are integers with like signs (both positive or both negative), then the product ab and the quotient a/b are positive. (+)(+) = + or (+)/(+) = + (−)(−) = + or (−)/(−) = + You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Simplify each of the following expressions:Simplify: (−18)(−5) (a) (2)(3) (b) (−12)(−8) (c) −14/(−2) Solution: When multiplying or dividing, like signs yield a positive result. (a) (2)(3) = 6 (b) (−12)(−8) = 96 (c) −14/(−2) = 7Answer: 90 ! Unlike Signs. If a and b are integers with unlike signs (one positive and one negative), then the product ab and the quotient a/b are negative. (+)(−) = − or (+)/(−) = − (−)(+) = − or (−)/(+) = − 1.1. AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INTEGERS 9 You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Simplify each of the following expressions: Simplify: (−19)(3) (a) (2)(−12) (b) (−9)(12) (c) 24/(−8) Solution: When multiplying or dividing, unlike signs yield a negative result. (a) (2)(−12) = −24 (b) (−9)(12) = −108 (c) 24/(−8) = −3 Answer: −57 ! Integer Multiplication This section is designed to provide a quick review of multiplication and division of integers.
