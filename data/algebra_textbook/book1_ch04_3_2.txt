Equations Equation An equation is a statement that two algebraic expressions are equal. An equation is composed of three parts. Each of the boxes represents an algebraic expression. An equation consists of two expressions separated by an equal sign. The equal sign makes the statement that the two expressions are equivalent, that is, they represent the same value. For example: Example 4.32.  f = 32a .The equation expresses the relationship between the variables f and a . It states that the value of f is always 32 times that of a . Example 4.33.  y = 6x + 8 .The equation expresses the relationship between the variables x and y . It states that the value of y is always 8 more than 6 times the value of x .
