Perimeter Perimeter The perimeter of a polygon is the distance around the polygon. To find the perimeter of a polygon, we simply add up the lengths of all the sides. Sample Set A Find the perimeter of each polygon. Example 9.20.  Example 9.21.  Example 9.22.  Our first observation is that three of the dimensions are missing. However, we can determine the missing measurements using the following process. Let A, B, and C represent the missing measurements. Visualize A = 12m – 2m = 10m B = 9m + 1m – 2m = 8m C = 12m – 1m = 11m Practice Set A Find the perimeter of each polygon. Exercise 9.5.1. (Go to Solution) Exercise 9.5.2.
