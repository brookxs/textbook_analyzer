 ||  || Numbers and Numerals We begin our study of introductory mathematics by examining its most basic building block, the number. Number A number is a concept. It exists only in the mind. The earliest concept of a number was a thought that allowed people to mentally picture the size of some collection of objects. To write down the number being conceptualized, a numeral is used. Numeral A numeral is a symbol that represents a number. In common usage today we do not distinguish between a number and a numeral. In our study of introductory mathematics, we will follow this common usage. Sample Set A The following are numerals. In each case, the first represents the number four, the second repre­sents the number one hundred twenty-three, and the third, the number one thousand five. These numbers are represented in different ways. Hindu-Arabic numerals 4, 123, 1005 Roman numerals IV, CXXIII, MV Egyptian numerals Practice Set A Exercise 1.2.1. (Go to Solution) Do the phrases "four," "one hundred twenty-three," and "one thousand five" qualify as numerals? Yes or no?  || The Hindu-Arabic Numeration System Hindu-Arabic Numeration System Our society uses the Hindu-Arabic numeration system. This system of numer­ation began shortly before the third century when the Hindus invented the nu­merals 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Leonardo Fibonacci About a thousand years later, in the thirteenth century, a mathematician named Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa introduced the system into Europe. It was then popu­larized by the Arabs. Thus, the name, Hindu-Arabic numeration system.  || The Base Ten Positional Number System Digits The Hindu-Arabic numerals 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 are called digits. We can form any number in the number system by selecting one or more digits and placing them in certain positions. Each position has a particular value. The Hindu mathematician who devised the system about A.D. 500 stated that "from place to place each is ten times the preceding." Base Ten Positional Systems It is for this reason that our number system is called a positional number system with base ten. Commas When numbers are composed of more than three digits, commas are sometimes used to separate the digits into groups of three. Periods These groups of three are called periods and they greatly simplify reading numbers. In the Hindu-Arabic numeration system, a period has a value assigned to each or its three positions, and the values are the same for each period. The position values are Thus, each period contains a position for the values of one, ten, and hundred. Notice that, in looking from right to left, the value of each position is ten times the preceding. Each period has a particular name. As we continue from right to left, there are more periods. The five periods listed above are the most common, and in our study of introductory mathematics, they are sufficient. The following diagram illustrates our positional number system to trillions. (There are, to be sure, other periods.) In our positional number system, the value of a digit is determined by its position in the number. Sample Set B Example 1.1.  Find the value of 6 in the number 7,261. Since 6 is in the tens position of the units period, its value is 6 tens. 6 tens = 60 Example 1.2.  Find the value of 9 in the number 86,932,106,005. Since 9 is in the hundreds position of the millions period, its value is 9 hundred millions. 9 hundred millions = 9 hundred million Example 1.3.  Find the value of 2 in the number 102,001. Since 2 is in the ones position of the thousands period, its value is 2 one thousands. 2 one thousands = 2 thousand Practice Set B Exercise 1.2.2. (Go to Solution) Find the value of 5 in the number 65,000. Exercise 1.2.3. (Go to Solution) Find the value of 4 in the number 439,997,007,010. Exercise 1.2.4. (Go to Solution) Find the value of 0 in the number 108.  || Whole Numbers Whole Numbers Numbers that are formed using only the digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 are called whole numbers. They are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, … The three dots at the end mean "and so on in this same pattern."  || Graphing Whole Numbers Number Line Whole numbers may be visualized by constructing a number line. To construct a number line, we simply draw a straight line and choose any point on the line and label it 0. Origin This point is called the origin. We then choose some convenient length, and moving to the right, mark off consecutive intervals (parts) along the line starting at 0. We label each new interval endpoint with the next whole number. Graphing We can visually display a whole number by drawing a closed circle at the point labeled with that whole number. Another phrase for visually displaying a whole number is graphing the whole number. The word graph means to "visually display." Sample Set C Example 1.4.  Graph the following whole numbers: 3, 5, 9. Example 1.5.  Specify the whole numbers that are graphed on the following number line. The break in the number line indicates that we are aware of the whole numbers between 0 and 106, and 107 and 872, but we are not listing them due to space limitations. The numbers that have been graphed are 0, 106, 873, 874 Practice Set C Exercise 1.2.5. (Go to Solution) Graph the following whole numbers: 46, 47, 48, 325, 327. Exercise 1.2.6. (Go to Solution) Specify the whole numbers that are graphed on the following number line. A line is composed of an endless number of points. Notice that we have labeled only some of them. As we proceed, we will discover new types of numbers and determine their location on the number line.  ||  || Reading Whole Numbers To convert a number that is formed by digits into a verbal phrase, use the following method: Beginning at the right and working right to left, separate the number into distinct periods by inserting commas every three digits. Beginning at the left, read each period individually, saying the period name. Sample Set A Write the following numbers as words. Example 1.6.  Read 42958. Beginning at the right, we can separate this number into distinct periods by inserting a comma between the 2 and 9. 42,958 Beginning at the left, we read each period individually: Forty-two thousand, nine hundred fifty-eight. Example 1.7.  Read 307991343. Beginning at the right, we can separate this number into distinct periods by placing commas between the 1 and 3 and the 7 and 9. 307,991,343 Beginning at the left, we read each period individually. Three hundred seven million, nine hundred ninety-one thousand, three hundred forty-three. Example 1.8.  Read 36000000000001. Beginning at the right, we can separate this number into distinct periods by placing commas. 36,000,000,001 Beginning at the left, we read each period individually. Thirty-six trillion, one. Practice Set A Write each number in words. Exercise 1.3.1. (Go to Solution) 12,542 Exercise 1.3.2. (Go to Solution) 101,074,003 Exercise 1.3.3. (Go to Solution) 1,000,008  || Writing Whole Numbers To express a number in digits that is expressed in words, use the following method: Notice first that a number expressed as a verbal phrase will have its periods set off by commas. Starting at the beginning of the phrase, write each period of numbers individu­ally. Using commas to separate periods, combine the periods to form one number. Sample Set B Write each number using digits. Example 1.9.  Seven thousand, ninety-two. Using the comma as a period separator, we have 7,092 Example 1.10.  Fifty billion, one million, two hundred thousand, fourteen. Using the commas as period separators, we have 50,001,200,014 Example 1.11.  Ten million, five hundred twelve. The comma sets off the periods. We notice that there is no thousands period. We'll have to insert this ourselves. 10,000,512 Practice Set B Express each number using digits. Exercise 1.3.4. (Go to Solution) One hundred three thousand, twenty-five. Exercise 1.3.5. (Go to Solution) Six million, forty thousand, seven. Exercise 1.3.6. (Go to Solution) Twenty trillion, three billion, eighty million, one hundred nine thousand, four hundred two. Exercise 1.3.7. (Go to Solution) Eighty billion, thirty-five.  ||  || Rounding as an Approximation A primary use of whole numbers is to keep count of how many objects there are in a collection. Sometimes we're only interested in the approximate number of objects in the collection rather than the precise number. For example, there are approxi­mately 20 symbols in the collection below. The precise number of symbols in the above collection is 18. Rounding We often approximate the number of objects in a collection by mentally seeing the collection as occurring in groups of tens, hundreds, thousands, etc. This process of approximation is called rounding. Rounding is very useful in estimation. We will study estimation in Chapter 8. When we think of a collection as occurring in groups of tens, we say we're rounding to the nearest ten. When we think of a collection as occurring in groups of hundreds, we say we're rounding to the nearest hundred. This idea of rounding continues through thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions, etc. The process of rounding whole numbers is illustrated in the following examples. Example 1.12.  Round 67 to the nearest ten. On the number line, 67 is more than halfway from 60 to 70. The digit immedi­ately to the right of the tens digit, the round-off digit, is the indicator for this. Thus, 67, rounded to the nearest ten, is 70. Example 1.13.  Round 4,329 to the nearest hundred. On the number line, 4,329 is less than halfway from 4,300 to 4,400. The digit to the immediate right of the hundreds digit, the round-off digit, is the indicator. Thus, 4,329, rounded to the nearest hundred is 4,300. Example 1.14.  Round 16,500 to the nearest thousand. On the number line, 16,500 is exactly halfway from 16,000 to 17,000. By convention, when the number to be rounded is exactly halfway between two numbers, it is rounded to the higher number. Thus, 16,500, rounded to the nearest thousand, is 17,000. Example 1.15.  A person whose salary is $41,450 per year might tell a friend that she makes $41,000 per year. She has rounded 41,450 to the nearest thousand. The number 41,450 is closer to 41,000 than it is to 42,000.  || The Method of Rounding Whole Numbers From the observations made in the preceding examples, we can use the following method to round a whole number to a particular position. Mark the position of the round-off digit. Note the digit to the immediate right of the round-off digit. If it is less than 5, replace it and all the digits to its right with zeros. Leave the round-off digit unchanged. If it is 5 or larger, replace it and all the digits to its right with zeros. Increase the round-off digit by 1. Sample Set A Use the method of rounding whole numbers to solve the following problems. Example 1.16.  Round 3,426 to the nearest ten. We are rounding to the tens position. Mark the digit in the tens position Observe the digit immediately to the right of the tens position. It is 6. Since 6 is greater than 5, we round up by replacing 6 with 0 and adding 1 to the digit in the tens position (the round-off position): 2 + 1 = 3 . 3,430 Thus, 3,426 rounded to the nearest ten is 3,430. Example 1.17.  Round 9,614,018,007 to the nearest ten million. We are rounding to the nearest ten million. Observe the digit immediately to the right of the ten millions position. It is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we round down by replacing 4 and all the digits to its right with zeros. 9,610,000,000 Thus, 9,614,018,007 rounded to the nearest ten million is 9,610,000,000. Example 1.18.  Round 148,422 to the nearest million. Since we are rounding to the nearest million, we'll have to imagine a digit in the millions position. We'll write 148,422 as 0,148,422. The digit immediately to the right is 1. Since 1 is less than 5, we'll round down by replacing it and all the digits to its right with zeros. 0,000,000 This number is 0. Thus, 148,422 rounded to the nearest million is 0. Example 1.19.  Round 397,000 to the nearest ten thousand. We are rounding to the nearest ten thousand. The digit immediately to the right of the ten thousand position is 7. Since 7 is greater than 5, we round up by replacing 7 and all the digits to its right with zeros and adding 1 to the digit in the ten thousands position. But 9 + 1 = 10 and we must carry the 1 to the next (the hundred thousands) position. 400,000 Thus, 397,000 rounded to the nearest ten thousand is 400,000. Practice Set A Use the method of rounding whole numbers to solve each problem. Exercise 1.4.1. (Go to Solution) Round 3387 to the nearest hundred. Exercise 1.4.2. (Go to Solution) Round 26,515 to the nearest thousand. Exercise 1.4.3. (Go to Solution) Round 30,852,900 to the nearest million. Exercise 1.4.4. (Go to Solution) Round 39 to the nearest hundred. Exercise 1.4.5. (Go to Solution) Round 59,600 to the nearest thousand.  ||  || Addition Suppose we have two collections of objects that we combine together to form a third collection. For example, We are combining a collection of four objects with a collection of three objects to obtain a collection of seven objects. Addition The process of combining two or more objects (real or intuitive) to form a third, the total, is called addition. In addition, the numbers being added are called addends or terms, and the total is called the sum. The plus symbol (+) is used to indicate addition, and the equal symbol (=) is used to represent the word "equal." For example, 4 + 3 = 7 means "four added to three equals seven."  || Addition Visualized on the Number Line Addition is easily visualized on the number line. Let's visualize the addition of 4 and 3 using the number line. To find 4 + 3, Start at 0. Move to the right 4 units. We are now located at 4. From 4, move to the right 3 units. We are now located at 7. Thus, 4 + 3 = 7.  || The Addition Process We'll study the process of addition by considering the sum of 25 and 43. We write this as 68. We can suggest the following procedure for adding whole numbers using this example. Example 1.20. The Process of Adding Whole Numbers To add whole numbers, The process: Write the numbers vertically, placing corresponding positions in the same column. Add the digits in each column. Start at the right (in the ones position) and move to the left, placing the sum at the bottom. Caution Confusion and incorrect sums can occur when the numbers are not aligned in columns properly. Avoid writing such additions as Sample Set A Example 1.21.  Add 276 and 103. Example 1.22.  Add 1459 and 130 In each of these examples, each individual sum does not exceed 9. We will examine individual sums that exceed 9 in the next section. Practice Set A Perform each addition. Show the expanded form in problems 1 and 2. Exercise 1.5.1. (Go to Solution) Add 63 and 25. Exercise 1.5.2. (Go to Solution) Add 4,026 and 1,501. Exercise 1.5.3. (Go to Solution) Add 231,045 and 36,121.  || Addition Involving Carrying It often happens in addition that the sum of the digits in a column will exceed 9. This happens when we add 18 and 34. We show this in expanded form as follows. Notice that when we add the 8 ones to the 4 ones we get 12 ones. We then convert the 12 ones to 1 ten and 2 ones. In vertical addition, we show this conversion by carrying the ten to the tens column. We write a 1 at the top of the tens column to indicate the carry. This same example is shown in a shorter form as follows: 8 + 4 = 12 Write 2, carry 1 ten to the top of the next column to the left. Sample Set B Perform the following additions. Use the process of carrying when needed. Example 1.23.  Add 1875 and 358. The sum is 2233. Example 1.24.  Add 89,208 and 4,946. The sum is 94,154. Example 1.25.  Add 38 and 95. As you proceed with the addition, it is a good idea to keep in mind what is actually happening. The sum is 133. Example 1.26.  Find the sum 2648, 1359, and 861. The sum is 4,868. Numbers other than 1 can be carried as illustrated in Example 1.27. Example 1.27.  Find the sum of the following numbers. The sum is 983,689. Example 1.28.  The number of students enrolled at Riemann College in the years 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987 was 10,406, 9,289, 10,108, and 11,412, respectively. What was the total number of students en­rolled at Riemann College in the years 1985, 1986, and 1987? We can determine the total number of students enrolled by adding 9,289, 10,108, and 11,412, the number of students enrolled in the years 1985, 1986, and 1987. The total number of students enrolled at Riemann College in the years 1985, 1986, and 1987 was 30,809. Practice Set B Perform each addition. For the next three problems, show the expanded form. Exercise 1.5.4. (Go to Solution) Add 58 and 29. Exercise 1.5.5. (Go to Solution) Add 476 and 85. Exercise 1.5.6. (Go to Solution) Add 27 and 88. Exercise 1.5.7. (Go to Solution) Add 67,898 and 85,627. For the next three problems, find the sums. Exercise 1.5.8. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.5.9. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.5.10. (Go to Solution)  || Calculators Calculators provide a very simple and quick way to find sums of whole numbers. For the two problems in Sample Set C, assume the use of a calculator that does not require the use of an ENTER key (such as many Hewlett-Packard calculators). Sample Set C Use a calculator to find each sum. Example 1.29.  Table 1.36. 34 + 21 Display Reads Type 34 34 Press + 34 Type 21 21 Press = 55 The sum is 55. Example 1.30.  Table 1.37. 106 + 85 + 322 + 406 Display Reads   Type 106 106 The calculator keeps a running subtotal Press + 106   Type 85 85   Press = 191 ← 106 + 85 Type 322 322   Press + 513 ← 191 + 322 Type 406 406   Press = 919 ← 513 + 406 The sum is 919. Practice Set C Use a calculator to find the following sums. Exercise 1.5.11. (Go to Solution) 62 + 81 + 12 Exercise 1.5.12. (Go to Solution) 9,261 + 8,543 + 884 + 1,062 Exercise 1.5.13. (Go to Solution) 10,221 + 9,016 + 11,445  ||  || Subtraction Subtraction Subtraction is the process of determining the remainder when part of the total is removed. Suppose the sum of two whole numbers is 11, and from 11 we remove 4. Using the number line to help our visualization, we see that if we are located at 11 and move 4 units to the left, and thus remove 4 units, we will be located at 7. Thus, 7 units remain when we remove 4 units from 11 units. The Minus Symbol The minus symbol (-) is used to indicate subtraction. For example, 11 − 4 indicates that 4 is to be subtracted from 11. Minuend The number immediately in front of or the minus symbol is called the minuend, and it represents the original number of units. Subtrahend The number immediately following or below the minus symbol is called the subtrahend, and it represents the number of units to be removed. Difference The result of the subtraction is called the difference of the two numbers. For example, in 11 − 4 = 7, 11 is the minuend, 4 is the subtrahend, and 7 is the difference.  || Subtraction as the Opposite of Addition Subtraction can be thought of as the opposite of addition. We show this in the problems in Sample Set A. Sample Set A Example 1.31.  8 − 5 = 3 since 3 + 5 = 8. Example 1.32.  9 − 3 = 6 since 6 + 3 = 9. Practice Set A Complete the following statements. Exercise 1.6.1. (Go to Solution) 7 − 5 = __________ since __________ + 5 = 7. Exercise 1.6.2. (Go to Solution) 9 − 1 = __________ since __________ + 1 = 9. Exercise 1.6.3. (Go to Solution) 17 − 8 = __________ since __________ + 8 = 17.  || The Subtraction Process We'll study the process of the subtraction of two whole numbers by considering the difference between 48 and 35. which we write as 13. Example 1.33. The Process of Subtracting Whole Numbers To subtract two whole numbers, The process Write the numbers vertically, placing corresponding positions in the same column. Subtract the digits in each column. Start at the right, in the ones position, and move to the left, placing the difference at the bottom. Sample Set B Perform the following subtractions. Example 1.34.  Example 1.35.  Example 1.36.  Find the difference between 977 and 235. Write the numbers vertically, placing the larger number on top. Line up the columns properly. The difference between 977 and 235 is 742. Example 1.37.  In Keys County in 1987, there were 809 cable television installations. In Flags County in 1987, there were 1,159 cable television installations. How many more cable television installations were there in Flags County than in Keys County in 1987? We need to determine the difference between 1,159 and 809. There were 350 more cable television installations in Flags County than in Keys County in 1987. Practice Set B Perform the following subtractions. Exercise 1.6.4. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.5. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.6. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.8. (Go to Solution) Find the difference between 88,526 and 26,412. In each of these problems, each bottom digit is less than the corresponding top digit. This may not always be the case. We will examine the case where the bottom digit is greater than the corresponding top digit in the next section.  || Subtraction Involving Borrowing Minuend and Subtrahend It often happens in the subtraction of two whole numbers that a digit in the minuend (top number) will be less than the digit in the same position in the subtrahend (bottom number). This happens when we subtract 27 from 84. We do not have a name for 4 − 7. We need to rename 84 in order to continue. We'll do so as follows: Our new name for 84 is 7 tens + 14 ones. Notice that we converted 8 tens to 7 tens + 1 ten, and then we converted the 1 ten to 10 ones. We then had 14 ones and were able to perform the subtraction. Borrowing The process of borrowing (converting) is illustrated in the problems of Sample Set C. Sample Set C Example 1.38.  Borrow 1 ten from the 8 tens. This leaves 7 tens. Convert the 1 ten to 10 ones. Add 10 ones to 4 ones to get 14 ones. Example 1.39.  Borrow 1 hundred from the 6 hundreds. This leaves 5 hundreds. Convert the 1 hundred to 10 tens. Add 10 tens to 7 tens to get 17 tens. Practice Set C Perform the following subtractions. Show the expanded form for the first three problems. Exercise 1.6.9. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.10.

(Go to Solution) Borrowing More Than Once Sometimes it is necessary to borrow more than once. This is shown in the problems in the section called “Sample Set D”. Sample Set D Perform the Subtractions. Borrowing more than once if necessary Example 1.40.  Borrow 1 ten from the 4 tens. This leaves 3 tens. Convert the 1 ten to 10 ones. Add 10 ones to 1 one to get 11 ones. We can now perform 11 − 8. Borrow 1 hundred from the 6 hundreds. This leaves 5 hundreds. Convert the 1 hundred to 10 tens. Add 10 tens to 3 tens to get 13 tens. Now 13 − 5 = 8. 5 − 3 = 2. Example 1.41.  Borrow 1 ten from the 3 tens. This leaves 2 tens. Convert the 1 ten to 10 ones. Add 10 ones to 4 ones to get 14 ones. We can now perform 14 − 5. Borrow 1 hundred from the 5 hundreds. This leaves 4 hundreds. Convert the 1 hundred to 10 tens. Add 10 tens to 2 tens to get 12 tens. We can now perform 12 − 8 = 4. Finally, 4 − 0 = 4. Example 1.42.  After borrowing, we have Practice Set D Perform the following subtractions. Exercise 1.6.15. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.16. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.17. (Go to Solution)  || Borrowing from Zero It often happens in a subtraction problem that we have to borrow from one or more zeros. This occurs in problems such as and We'll examine each case. Example 1.43. Borrowing from a single zero. Consider the problem Since we do not have a name for 3 − 7, we must borrow from 0. Since there are no tens to borrow, we must borrow 1 hundred. One hundred = 10 tens. We can now borrow 1 ten from 10 tens (leaving 9 tens). One ten = 10 ones and 10 ones + 3 ones = 13 ones. Now we can suggest the following method for borrowing from a single zero. Borrowing from a Single Zero To borrow from a single zero, Decrease the digit to the immediate left of zero by one. Draw a line through the zero and make it a 10. Proceed to subtract as usual. Sample Set E Example 1.44.  Perform this subtraction. The number 503 contains a single zero The number to the immediate left of 0 is 5. Decrease 5 by 1. 5 − 1 = 4 Draw a line through the zero and make it a 10. Borrow from the 10 and proceed. 1 ten + 10 ones 10 ones + 3 ones = 13 ones Practice Set E Perform each subtraction. Exercise 1.6.18. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.19. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.20. (Go to Solution) Example 1.45. Borrowing from a group of zeros Consider the problem In this case, we have a group of zeros. Since we cannot borrow any tens or hundreds, we must borrow 1 thousand. One thousand = 10 hundreds. We can now borrow 1 hundred from 10 hundreds. One hundred = 10 tens. We can now borrow 1 ten from 10 tens. One ten = 10 ones. From observations made in this procedure we can suggest the following method for borrowing from a group of zeros. Borrowing from a Group of zeros To borrow from a group of zeros, Decrease the digit to the immediate left of the group of zeros by one. Draw a line through each zero in the group and make it a 9, except the rightmost zero, make it 10. Proceed to subtract as usual. Sample Set F Perform each subtraction. Example 1.46.  The number 40,000 contains a group of zeros. The number to the immediate left of the group is 4. Decrease 4 by 1. 4 − 1 = 3 Make each 0, except the rightmost one, 9. Make the rightmost 0 a 10. Subtract as usual. Example 1.47.  The number 8,000,006 contains a group of zeros. The number to the immediate left of the group is 8. Decrease 8 by 1. 8 − 1 = 7 Make each zero, except the rightmost one, 9. Make the rightmost 0 a 10. To perform the subtraction, we’ll need to borrow from the ten.

Sample Set A Example 1.48.  Add the whole numbers 8 + 5 = 13 5 + 8 = 13 The numbers 8 and 5 can be added in any order. Regardless of the order they are added, the sum is 13. Practice Set A Exercise 1.7.1. (Go to Solution) Use the commutative property of addition to find the sum of 12 and 41 in two different ways. Exercise 1.7.2. (Go to Solution) Add the whole numbers  || The Associative Property of Addition Associative Property of Addition If three whole numbers are to be added, the sum will be the same if the first two are added first, then that sum is added to the third, or, the second two are added first, and that sum is added to the first. Using Parentheses It is a common mathematical practice to use parentheses to show which pair of numbers we wish to combine first. Sample Set B Example 1.49.  Add the whole numbers. Practice Set B Exercise 1.7.3. (Go to Solution) Use the associative property of addition to add the following whole numbers two different ways. Exercise 1.7.4. (Go to Solution)  || The Additive Identity 0 Is the Additive Identity The whole number 0 is called the additive identity, since when it is added to any whole number, the sum is identical to that whole number. Sample Set C Example 1.50.  Add the whole numbers. 29 + 0 = 29 0 + 29 = 29 Zero added to 29 does not change the identity of 29. Practice Set C Add the following whole numbers. Exercise 1.7.5. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.7.6. (Go to Solution) Suppose we let the letter x represent a choice for some whole number. For the first two problems, find the sums. For the third problem, find the sum provided we now know that x represents the whole number 17. Exercise 1.7.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.7.8. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.7.9. (Go to Solution)  ||
