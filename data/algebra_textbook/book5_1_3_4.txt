Adding Fractions First the definition. Addition of Fractions. If two fractions have a denominator in common, add the numerators and place the result over the common denominator. In symbols: a c + b c = a+ b c For example: −3 5 + 7 5 = 4 5 and − 4 3 + ( −7 3 ) = −11 3 and 4 7 + ( −5 7 ) = −1 7 If the fractions do not posses a common denominator, first create equivalent fractions with a least common denominator, then add according to the rule above. Least Common Denominator. If the fractions a/b and c/d do not share a common denominator, the least common denominator for b and d, written LCD(b, d), is defined as the smallest number divisible by both b and d. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Simplify: −3 8 + 5 12Simplify: − 5 6 + 1 9 Solution: The least common denominator in this case is the smallest number divisible by both 8 and 12. In this case, LCD(8, 12) = 24. We first need to make equivalent fractions with a common denominator of 24. −3 8 + 5 12 = −3 8 · 3 3 + 5 12 · 2 2 Make equivalent fraction with a common denominator of 24. = − 9 24 + 10 24 Multiply numerators and denominators. = 1 24 Add: −9 + 10 = 1. Note how we add the numerators in the last step, placing the result over the common denominator. Thus, −3/8 + 5/12 = 1/24.Answer: −13/18 ! 1.3.
