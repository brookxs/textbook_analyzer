Formulas To find the circumference of a circle, we need only know its diameter or radius. We then use a formula for computing the circumference of the circle. Formula A formula is a rule or method for performing a task. In mathematics, a formula is a rule that directs us in computations. Formulas are usually composed of letters that represent important, but possibly unknown, quantities. If C , d , and r represent, respectively, the circumference, diameter, and radius of a circle, then the following two formulas give us directions for computing the circum­ference of the circle. Circumference Formulas C = π d or C ≈ (3.14)d C = 2 π r or C ≈ 2(3.14)r Sample Set B Example 9.23.  Find the exact circumference of the circle. Use the formula C = π d . By commutativity of multiplication, , exactly This result is exact since π has not been approximated. Example 9.24.  Find the approximate circumference of the circle. Use the formula C = π d . C ≈ ( 3 . 14 ) ( 6 . 2 ) C ≈ 19 . 648   mm This result is approximate since π has been approximated by 3.14. Example 9.25.  Find the approximate circumference of a circle with radius 18 inches. Since we're given that the radius, r , is 18 in., we'll use the formula C = 2 π r . C ≈ (2) ( 3 . 14 ) ( 18   in . ) C ≈ 113 . 04   in . Example 9.26.  Find the approximate perimeter of the figure. We notice that we have two semicircles (half circles). The larger radius is 6.2 cm. The smaller radius is 6.2 cm - 2.0 cm = 4.2 cm. The width of the bottom part of the rectangle is 2.0 cm.
