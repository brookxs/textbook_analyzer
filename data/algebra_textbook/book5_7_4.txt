7.4 Solving Rational Equations In Section 3 of Chapter 2, we showed that the most efficient way to solve an equation containing fractions was to first clear the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator. For example, given the equation 1 2 x+ 1 3 = 1 4 , we would first clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by 12. 12 [ 1 2 x+ 1 3 ] = [ 1 4 ] 12 6x+ 4 = 3 This procedure works equally well when the the denominators contain a vari- able. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve for x: 1− 2 x = 3 x2Solve for x: 1− 6 x = − 8 x2 Solution: The common denominator is x2. We begin by clearing fractions, multiplying both sides of the equation by x2. 1− 2 x = 3 x2 Original equation. x2 [ 1− 2 x ] = [ 3 x2 ] x2 Multiply both sides by x2. Now we use the distributive property. x2 [1]− x2 [ 2 x ] = [ 3 x2 ] x2 Distribute x2. Now we cancel common factors and simplify. x2 − 2x = 3 Cancel. Simplify. The resulting equation is nonlinear (x is raised to a power larger than 1. Make one side zero, then factor. x2 − 2x− 3 = 0 Nonlinear. Make one side zero. (x− 3)(x+ 1) = 0 Factor. 7.4.

Compare your solutions. 7.4. SOLVING RATIONAL EQUATIONS 519 Algebraic solution: First, an algebraic approach. Multiply both sides of the equation by the common denominator x2. 2− 9 x = 5 x2 Original equation. x2 [ 2− 9 x ] = [ 5 x2 ] x2 Multiply both sides by x2. x2 [2]− x2 [ 9 x ] = [ 5 x2 ] x2 Distribute x2. 2x2 − 9x = 5 Cancel and simplify. The last equation is nonlinear. Make one side zero. 2x2 − 9x− 5 = 0 Make one side zero. The integer pair −10 and 1 have product equaling ac = −10 and sum equaling b = −9. Break up the middle term using this pair, then factor by grouping. 2x2 − 10x+ x− 5 = 0 −10x+ x = −9x. 2x(x− 5) + 1(x− 5) = 0 Factor by grouping. (2x+ 1)(x− 5) = 0 Factor out x− 5. Now use the zero product property to write: 2x+ 1 = 0 or x− 5 = 0 2x = −1 x = 5 x = −1 2 Hence, the solutions are x = −1/2 and x = 5. Graphical solution: We could load each side of the equation separately, then use the intersect utility to find where the graphs intersect. However, in this case, it’s a bit easier to make one side of the equation zero, draw a single graph, then note where the graph crosses the x-axis. 2− 9 x = 5 x2 Original equation. 2− 9 x − 5 x2 = 0 Make one side zero. Load the left-hand side of the equation into Y1 as 2-9/X-5/X∧2 (see the image on the left in Figure 7.8), then select 6:ZStandard from the ZOOM menu to produce the image at the right in Figure 7.8.

There are two possible numbers, 5/4 and 4/5. 5. Look back. The sum of the unknown number and its reciprocal is supposed to equal 41/20. The answer 5/4 has reciprocal 4/5. Their sum is: 5 4 + 4 5 = 16 20 + 25 20 = 41 20 Thus, 5/4 is a valid solution. The second answer 4/5 has reciprocal 5/4, so it is clear that their sum is also 41/20.
