Terms and Factors Terms In an algebraic expression, the quantities joined by " + " signs are called terms. In some expressions it will appear that terms are joined by " − " signs. We must keep in mind that subtraction is addition of the negative, that is, a − b = a + ( − b) . An important concept that all students of algebra must be aware of is the difference between terms and factors. Factors Any numbers or symbols that are multiplied together are factors of their product. Terms are parts of sums and are therefore joined by addition (or subtraction) signs.Factors are parts of products and are therefore joined by multiplication signs.
