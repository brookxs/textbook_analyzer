Multiplicative Inverse (The Reciprocal) For every real number a (except zero) there exists a real number denoted by 1/a such that a(1/a) = 1 The number 1/a is called the reciprocal or multiplicative inverse of a. Note that the reciprocal of 1/a is a. The reciprocal of the reciprocal gives you back what you started with. This allows us to define division as multiplication by the reciprocal: a ÷ b = a × (1/b) This is usually the most convenient way to think of division when you are doing algebra.
