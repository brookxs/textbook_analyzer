The Order of Operations Suppose we wish to find the value of 16 + 4⋅9 . We could add 16 and 4, then multiply this sum by 9. 16 + 4⋅9 = 20⋅9 = 180 multiply 4 and 9, then add 16 to this product. 16 + 4⋅9 = 16 + 36 = 52 We now have two values for one number. To determine the correct value we must use the standard order of operations. Order of Operations Perform all operations inside grouping symbols, beginning with the innermost set. Perform all multiplications and divisions, as you come to them, moving left-to-right. Perform all additions and subtractions, as you come to them, moving left-to-right. As we proceed in our study of algebra, we will come upon another operation, exponentiation, that will need to be inserted before multiplication and division. (See Section Section 2.5.)
