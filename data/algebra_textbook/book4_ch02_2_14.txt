Calculators Most multiplications are performed using a calculator. Sample Set E Example 2.9.  Multiply 75,891 by 263. Table 2.1. Display Reads Type 75891 75891 Press × 75891 Type 263 263 Press = 19959333 The product is 19,959,333. Example 2.10.  Multiply 4,510,000,000,000 by 1,700. Table 2.2. Display Reads Type 451 451 Press × 451 Type 17 17 Press = 7667 The display now reads 7667. We'll have to add the zeros ourselves. There are a total of 12 zeros. Attaching 12 zeros to 7667, we get 7,667,000,000,000,000. The product is 7,667,000,000,000,000. Example 2.11.  Multiply 57,847,298 by 38,976. Table 2.3. Display Reads Type 57847298 57847298 Press × 57847298 Type 38976 38976 Press = 2.2546563 12 The display now reads 2.2546563 12. What kind of number is this? This is an example of a whole number written in scientific notation. We'll study this concept when we get to decimal numbers. Practice Set E Use a calculator to perform each multiplication.
