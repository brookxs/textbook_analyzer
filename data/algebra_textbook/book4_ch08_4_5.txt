Estimation Using the Distributive Property We can use the distributive property to obtain exact results for products such as 25 ⋅ 23. The distributive property works best for products when one of the factors ends in 0 or 5. We shall restrict our attention to only such products. Sample Set B Use the distributive property to compute each value. Example 8.19.  25 ⋅ 23 Notice that 23 = 20 + 3. We now write Thus, 25 ⋅ 23 = 575 We could have proceeded by writing 23 as 30 – 7. Example 8.20.  15 ⋅ 37 Notice that 37 = 30 + 7. We now write Thus, 15 ⋅ 37 = 555 We could have proceeded by writing 37 as 40 – 3. Example 8.21.  15 ⋅ 86 Notice that 86 = 80 + 6. We now write We could have proceeded by writing 86 as 90 – 4. Practice Set B Use the distributive property to compute each value. Exercise 8.4.8. (Go to Solution) 25 ⋅ 12 Exercise 8.4.9.
