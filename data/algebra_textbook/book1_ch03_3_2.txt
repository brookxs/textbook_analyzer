Geometric Definition of Absolute Value Absolute Value—Geometric Approach The absolute value of a number a , denoted | a | , is the distance from a to 0 on the number line. Absolute value speaks to the question of "how far," and not "which way." The phrase how far implies length, and length is always a nonnegative (zero or positive) quantity. Thus, the absolute value of a number is a nonnegative number. This is shown in the following examples: Example 3.9.  | 4 | = 4 Example 3.10.  | − 4 | = 4 Example 3.11.  | 0 | = 0 Example 3.12.  − | 5 | = − 5 .The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as "negative the absolute value of 5." The absolute value of 5 is 5. Hence, negative the absolute value of 5 is − 5 . Example 3.13.  − | − 3 | = − 3 .The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as "negative the absolute value of − 3 ." The absolute value of − 3 is 3. Hence, negative the absolute value of − 3 is − ( 3 ) = − 3 .
