Notation for Multiplication We are used to using the symbol “×” to represent multiplication in arithmetic, but in algebra we prefer to avoid that symbol because we like to use the letter “x” to represent a variable, and the two symbols can be easily confused. So instead, we adopt the following notation for multiplication: 1.      Multiplication is implied if two quantities are written side-by-side with no other symbol between them. Example:  ab means a × b. 2.      If a symbol is needed to prevent confusion, we use a dot.   Example:  If we need to show 3 times 5, we cannot just write them next to each other or it would look like the number thirty-five, so we write 3 · 5. We can also use parentheses to separate factors. 3 times 5 could be written as 3(5) or (3)5 or (3)(5).
