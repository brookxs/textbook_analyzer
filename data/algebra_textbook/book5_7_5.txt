7.5 Direct and Inverse Variation We start with the definition of the phrase “is proportional to.” Proportional. We say that y is proportional to x if and only if y = kx, where k is a constant called the constant of proportionality. The phrase “y varies directly as x” is an equivalent way of saying “y is proportional to x.” Here are a few examples that translate the phrase “is proportional to.” • Given that d is proportional to t, we write d = kt, where k is a constant. • Given that y is proportional to the cube of x, we write y = kx3, where k is a constant. • Given that s is proportional to the square of t, we write s = kt2, where k is a constant. We are not restricted to always using the letter k for our constant of propor- tionality. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Given that y is proportional to x and the fact that y = 12 Given that y is proportional to x and that y = 21 when x = 9, determine the value of y when x = 27. when x = 5, determine the constant of proportionality, then determine the value of y when x = 10. Solution: Given the fact the y is proportional to x, we know immediately that y = kx, where k is the proportionality constant. Because we are given that y = 12 when x = 5, we can substitute 12 for y and 5 for x to determine k. y = kx y is proportional to x. 12 = k(5) Substitute 12 for y, 5 for x. 12 5 = k Divide both sides by 5. Next, substitute the constant of proportionality 12/5 for k in y = kx, then substitute 10 for x to determine y when x = 10. y = 12 5 x Substitute 12/5 for k. y = 12 5 (10) Substitute 10 for x. y = 24 Cancel and simplify.

The distance s the ball falls is proportional to the square of the time t that has passed since the ball’s release. If the ball falls 144 feet during the first 3 seconds, how far does the ball fall in 9 seconds? Solution: Given the fact the s is proportional to the square of t, we know immediately that s = kt2, where k is the proportionality constant. Because we are given that the ball falls 144 feet during the first 3 seconds, we can substitute 144 for s and 3 for t to determine the constant of proportionality. s = kt2 s is proportional to the square of t. 144 = k(3)2 Substitute 144 for s, 3 for t. 144 = 9k Simplify: 32 = 9. 16 = k Divide both sides by 9.

Answer: 8 inches !  || Inversely Proportional In Examples 1, 2, and 3, where one quantity was proportional to a second quantity, you may have noticed that when one quantity increased, the second quantity also increased. Vice-versa, when one quantity decreased, the second quantity also decreased. However, not all real-world situations follow this pattern. There are times when as one quantity increases, the related quantity decreases. For example, consider the situation where you increase the number of workers on a job and note that the time to finish the job decreases. This is an example of a quantity being inversely proportional to a second quantity. Inversely proportional. We say the y is inversely proportional to x if and only if y = k x , where k is a constant called the constant of proportionality. The phrase “y varies inversely as x” is an equivalent way of saying “y in inversely proportional to x.” Here are a few examples that translate the phrase “is inversely proportional to.” • Given that d is inversely proportional to t, we write d = k/t, where k is a constant. 528 CHAPTER 7.

Because we are given that the intensity is I = 3 foot-candles at d = 5 feet from the light source, we can substitute 3 for I and 5 for d to determine k. I = k d2 I is inversely proportional to d2. 3 = k 52 Substitute 3 for I, 5 for d. 3 = k 25 Simplify. 75 = k Multiply both sides by 25.
