Finding Areas of Some Common Geometric Figures Sample Set A Example 9.27.  Find the area of the triangle. The area of this triangle is 60 sq ft, which is often written as 60 ft2. Example 9.28.  Find the area of the rectangle. Let's first convert 4 ft 2 in. to inches. Since we wish to convert to inches, we'll use the unit fraction since it has inches in the numerator. Then, Thus, 4 ft 2 in. = 48 in. + 2 in. = 50 in. The area of this rectangle is 400 sq in. Example 9.29.  Find the area of the parallelogram. The area of this parallelogram is 63.86 sq cm. Example 9.30.  Find the area of the trapezoid. The area of this trapezoid is 71.545 sq mm. Example 9.31.  Find the approximate area of the circle. The area of this circle is approximately 886.23 sq ft. Practice Set A Find the area of each of the following geometric figures. Exercise 9.6.1. (Go to Solution) Exercise 9.6.2.
