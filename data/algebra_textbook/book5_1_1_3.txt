Integer Addition This section is designed to provide a quick review of integer addition. For a more thorough introduction to integer addition, read section two of chapter two of our prealgebra textbook, provided online at the following URL: http://msenux.redwoods.edu/PreAlgText/contents/chapter2/ chapter2.pdf We consider the first of two cases. Adding Integers with Like Signs. To add two integers with like signs (both positive or both negative), add their magnitudes (absolute values), then prefix their common sign. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Simplify 7 + 12. Simplify: 13 + 28 Solution: We have like signs. The magnitudes (absolute values) of 7 and 12 are 7 and 12, respectively. If we add the magnitudes, we get 19. If we prefix the common sign, we get 19. That is: 7 + 12 = 19 Answer: 41 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify −8 + (−9). Simplify: −12 + (−21) Solution: We have like signs. The magnitudes (absolute values) of −8 and −9 are 8 and 9, respectively. If we add the magnitudes, we get 17. If we prefix the common sign, we get −17. That is: −8 + (−9) = −17 Answer: −33 ! Next, we consider the case where we have unlike signs. Adding Integers with Unlike Signs. To add two integers with unlike signs (one positive and one negative), subtract the integer with the smaller magnitude (absolute value) from the number with the larger magnitude, then prefix the sign of the integer with the larger magnitude. 6 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify −14 + 11.Simplify: 12 + (−29) Solution: We have unlike signs. The magnitudes (absolute values) of −14 and 11 are 14 and 11, respectively. If we subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger, we get 3. The number −14 has the larger magnitude, so we prefix our answer with its negative sign. That is: −14 + 11 = −3Answer: −17 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify 40 + (−25).Simplify: 32 + (−90) Solution: We have unlike signs. The magnitudes (absolute values) of 40 and −25 are 40 and 25, respectively. If we subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger, we get 15. The number 40 has the larger magnitude, so we prefix our answer with its positive sign. That is: 40 + (−25) = 15Answer: −58 !
