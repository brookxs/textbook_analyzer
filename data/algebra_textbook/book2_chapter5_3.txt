 || Adding Polynomials Recall that we combine like terms, or terms with the same variable part, as a means to simplify expressions. To do this, add the coefficients of the terms to obtain a single term with the same variable part. For example, Notice that the variable part, x 2 , does not change. This, in addition to the commutative and associative properties of addition, allows us to add polynomials The process of combining all like terms of two or more polynomials. .   Example 1: Add: 3 x + ( 4 x − 5 ) . Solution: The property + ( a + b ) = a + b , which was derived using the distributive property, allows us to remove the parentheses so that we can add like terms. Answer: 7 x − 5   Example 2: Add: ( 3 x 2 + 3 x + 5 ) + ( 2 x 2 − x − 2 ) . Solution: Remove the parentheses and then combine like terms. Answer: 5 x 2 + 2 x + 3   Example 3: Add: ( − 5 x 2 y − 2 x y 2 + 7 x y ) + ( 4 x 2 y + 7 x y 2 − 3 x y ) . Solution: Remember that the variable parts have to be exactly the same before we can add the coefficients. Answer: − x 2 y + 5 x y 2 + 4 x y   It is common practice to present the terms of the simplified polynomial expression in descending order based on their degree. In other words, we typically present polynomials in standard form, with terms in order from highest to lowest degree.   Example 4: Add: ( a − 4 a 3 + a 5 − 8 ) + ( − 9 a 5 + a 4 − 7 a + 5 + a 3 ) . Solution: Answer: − 8 a 5 + a 4 − 3 a 3 − 6 a − 3   Try this! Add: ( 6 − 5 x 3 + x 2 − x ) + ( x 2 + x + 6 x 3 − 1 ) . Answer: x 3 + 2 x 2 + 5 Video Solution  || Subtracting Polynomials When subtracting polynomials The process of subtracting all the terms of one polynomial from another and combining like terms. , we see that the parentheses become very important. Recall that the distributive property allowed us to derive the following: In other words, when subtracting an algebraic expression, we remove the parentheses by subtracting each term.   Example 5: Subtract: 10 x − ( 3 x + 5 ) . Solution: Subtract each term within the parentheses and then combine like terms. Answer: 7 x − 5   Subtracting a quantity is equivalent to multiplying it by −1.   Example 6: Subtract: ( 3 x 2 + 3 x + 5 ) − ( 2 x 2 − x − 2 ) . Solution: Distribute the −1, remove the parentheses, and then combine like terms. Answer: x 2 + 4 x + 7   Multiplying the terms of a polynomial by −1 changes all the signs.   Example 7: Subtract: ( − 5 x 3 − 2 x 2 + 7 ) − ( 4 x 3 + 7 x 2 − 3 x + 2 ) . Solution: Distribute the −1, remove the parentheses, and then combine like terms. Answer: − 9 x 3 − 9 x 2 + 3 x + 5   Example 8: Subtract 6 x 2 − 3 x − 1 from 2 x 2 + 5 x − 2 . Solution: Since subtraction is not commutative, we must take care to set up the difference correctly. First, write the quantity ( 2 x 2 + 5 x − 2 ) ; from this, subtract the quantity ( 6 x 2 − 3 x − 1 ) . Answer: − 4 x 2 + 8 x − 1   Example 9: Simplify: ( 2 x 2 − 3 x + 5 ) − ( x 2 − 3 x + 1 ) + ( 5 x 2 − 4 x − 8 ) . Solution: Apply the distributive property, remove the parentheses, and then combine like terms. Answer: 6 x 2 − 4 x − 4   Try this! Subtract: ( 8 x 2 y − 5 x y 2 + 6 ) − ( x 2 y + 2 x y 2 − 1 ) . Answer: 7 x 2 y − 7 x y 2 + 7 Video Solution  || Adding and Subtracting Polynomial Functions We use function notation to indicate addition and subtraction of functions as follows: Addition of functions: ( f + g ) ( x ) = f ( x ) + g ( x ) Subtraction of functions: ( f − g ) ( x ) = f ( x ) − g ( x ) When using function notation, be careful to group the entire function and add or subtract accordingly.   Example 10: Calculate: ( f + g ) ( x ) , given f ( x ) = − x 2 − 3 x + 5 and g ( x ) = 3 x 2 + 2 x + 1 . Solution: The notation ( f + g ) ( x ) indicates that you should add the functions f ( x ) + g ( x ) and collect like terms. Answer: ( f + g ) ( x ) = 2 x 2 − x + 6   Example 11: Calculate: ( f − g ) ( x ) , given f ( x ) = 2 x − 3 and g ( x ) = − 2 x 2 + 2 x + 5 . Solution: The notation ( f − g ) ( x ) indicates that you should subtract the functions f ( x ) − g ( x ) : Answer: ( f − g ) ( x ) = 2 x 2 − 8   We may be asked to evaluate the sum or difference of two functions. We have the option to first find the sum or difference and use the resulting function to evaluate for the given variable, or to first evaluate each function and then find the sum or difference.   Example 12: Calculate: ( f − g ) ( 5 ) , given f ( x ) = x 2 + x − 7 and g ( x ) = 4 x + 10 . Solution: First, find ( f − g ) ( x ) = f ( x ) − g ( x ) . Therefore, Next, substitute 5 for the variable x. Answer: ( f − g ) ( 5 ) = − 7 Alternate Solution: Since ( f − g ) ( 5 ) = f ( 5 ) − g ( 5 ) , we can find f ( 5 ) and g ( 5 ) and then subtract the results. Therefore, we have Answer: ( f − g ) ( 5 ) = − 7  ||
