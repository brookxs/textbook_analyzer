Linear versus Nonlinear All of the equations solved in previous chapters were examples of what are called linear equations. If the highest power of the variable we are solving for is one, then the graphs involved are lines. Hence the term, linear equation. However, if the power on the variable we are solving for exceeds one, then the graphs involved are curves. Hence the term, nonlinear equation. In this chapter we will learn how to solve nonlinear equations involving polynomials. However, let’s first make sure we can recognize the difference between a linear and a nonlinear equation. Linear versus Nonlinear. Use the following conditions to determine if an equation is linear or nonlinear. 1. If the highest power of the variable we are solving for is one, then the equation is linear. 2. If the highest power of the variable we are solving for is larger than one, then the equation is nonlinear. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. If the instruction is “solve for x,” classify each of the followingClassify the following equation as linear or nonlinear: 2x = x3 − 4 equations as linear or nonlinear. 6.2. SOLVING NONLINEAR EQUATIONS 401 a) 3x− 5 = 4− 7x b) x2 = 8x Solution: Because the instruction is “solve for x,” to determine whether the equation is linear or nonlinear, we identify the largest power of x present in the equation. a) The highest power of x present in the equation 3x − 5 = 4 − 7x is one. Hence, this equation is linear. b) The equation x2 = 8x contains a power of x higher than one (it contains an x2). Hence, this equation is nonlinear. Answer: nonlinear ! Now that we can classify equations as either linear or nonlinear, let’s in- troduce strategies for solving each type, the first of which should already be familiar. Strategy for solving a linear equation. If an equation is linear, start the solution process by moving all terms containing the variable you are solving for to one side of the equation, then move all terms that do not contain the variable you are solving for to the other side of the equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve for x: 3x− 5 = 4− 7x Solve for x: 2x+ 4 = 6x+ 3 Solution: Because the instruction is “solve for x” and we note that the largest power of x present is one, the equation 3x − 5 = 4 − 7x is linear. Hence, the strategy is to move all terms containing x to one side of the equation, then move all the remaining terms to the other side of the equation. 3x− 5 = 4− 7x Original equation. 3x− 5 + 7x = 4 Add 7x to both sides. 3x+ 7x = 4 + 5 Add 5 to both sides. Note how we have succeeded in moving all terms containing x to one side of the equation and all terms that do not contain x to the other side of the equation. 10x = 9 Simplify both sides. x = 9 10 Divide both sides by 10. Hence, the solution of 3x− 5 = 4− 7x is x = 9/10. Readers are encouraged to check this solution. Answer: 1/4 ! 402 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING The situation is much different when the equation is nonlinear. Strategy for solving a nonlinear equation. If an equation is nonlinear, first move everything to one side of the equation, making one side of the equa- tion equal to zero. Continue the solution process by factoring and applying the zero product property. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Solve for x: x2 = 8xSolve for x: x2 = −5x Solution: Because the instruction is “solve for x,” and the highest power of x is larger than one, the equation x2 = 8x is nonlinear. Hence, the strategy requires that we move all terms to one side of the equation, making one side zero. x2 = 8x Original equation. x2 − 8x = 0 Subtract 8x from both sides. Note how we have succeeded in moving all terms to one side of the equation, making one side equal to zero. To finish the solution, we factor out the GCF on the left-hand side. x(x − 8) = 0 Factor out the GCF. Note that we now have a product of two factors that equals zero. By the zero product property, either the first factor is zero or the second factor is zero. x = 0 or x− 8 = 0 x = 8 Hence, the solutions are x = 0 and x = 8. Check: Check that each solution satisfies the original equation. Substitute 0 for x: x2 = 8x (0)2 = 8(0) 0 = 0 Subtitute 8 for x: x2 = 8x (8)2 = 8(8) 64 = 64 Note that both results are true statements, guaranteeing that both x = 0 and x = 8 are solutions of x2 = 8x.Answer: 0, −5 ! 6.2. SOLVING NONLINEAR EQUATIONS 403 Warning! The following is incorrect! Consider what would happen if we divided both sides of the equation x2 = 8x in Example 5 by x: x2 = 8x x2 x = 8x x x = 8 Note that we have lost the second answer found in Example 5, x = 0. This example demonstrates that you should never divide by the variable you are solving for! If you do, and cancellation occurs, you will lose answers. Let’s try solving a nonlinear equation that requires factoring by grouping. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Solve for x: 6x2 + 9x− 8x− 12 = 0 Solve for x: 5x2 − 20x− 4x+ 16 = 0Solution: Because we are solving for x and there is a power of x larger than one, this equation is nonlinear. Hence, the first step is to move everything to one side of the equation, making one side equal to zero. Well that’s already done, so let’s factor the left-hand side by grouping. Note that we can factor 3x out of the first two terms and −4 out of the second two terms. 6x2 + 9x− 8x− 12 = 0 3x (2x+ 3)− 4 (2x+ 3) = 0 Factor out the common factor 2x+ 3. (3x− 4)(2x+ 3) = 0 We now have a product of two factors that equals zero. Use the zero product property to write: 3x− 4 = 0 or 2x+ 3 = 0 3x = 4 2x = −3 x = 4 3 x = −3 2 Hence, the solutions are x = 4/3 and x = −3/2. Check. Let’s use the graphing calculator to check the solution x = 4/3. First, store the solution 4/3 in the variable X using the following keystrokes (see the first image in Figure 6.1. 404 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING 4 ÷ 3 STO! X,T,θ,n ENTER Next, enter the left-hand side of the equation 6x2 +9x− 8x− 12 = 0 using the following keystrokes. Note that the result in the second image in Figure 6.1 indicates that the expression 6x2 + 9x− 8x− 12 equals zero when x = 4/3. 6 × X,T,θ,n ∧ 2 + 9 × X,T,θ,n − 8 × X,T,θ,n − 1 2 ENTER Figure 6.1: Checking the solution x = 4/3. Therefore, the solution x = 4/3 checks. Readers are encouraged to use their graphing calculators to check the second solution, x = −3/2.Answer: 4/5, 4 !
