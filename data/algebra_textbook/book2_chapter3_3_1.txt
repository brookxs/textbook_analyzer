Definition of x- and y-Intercepts The x-intercept The point (or points) where a graph intersects the x-axis, expressed as an ordered pair (x, 0). is the point where the graph of a line intersects the x-axis. The y-intercept The point (or points) where a graph intersects the y-axis, expressed as an ordered pair (0, y). is the point where the graph of a line intersects the y-axis. These points have the form (x, 0) and (0, y), respectively. To find the x- and y-intercepts algebraically, use the fact that all x-intercepts have a y-value of zero and all y-intercepts have an x-value of zero. To find the y-intercept, set x = 0 and determine the corresponding y-value. Similarly, to find the x-intercept, set y = 0 and determine the corresponding x-value.   Example 1: Find the x- and y-intercepts: − 3 x + 2 y = 12 . Solution: To find the x-intercept, set y = 0. Therefore, the x-intercept is (−4, 0). To find the y-intercept, set x = 0. Hence the y-intercept is (0, 6). Note that this linear equation is graphed above. Answer: x-intercept: (−4, 0); y-intercept: (0, 6)   Example 2: Find the x- and y-intercepts: y = − 3 x + 9 . Solution: Begin by finding the x-intercept. The x-intercept is (3, 0). Next, determine the y-intercept. The y-intercept is (0, 9). Answer: x-intercept: (3, 0); y-intercept: (0, 9)   Keep in mind that the intercepts are ordered pairs and not numbers. In other words, the x-intercept is not x = 2 but rather (2, 0). In addition, not all graphs necessarily have both intercepts: for example, The horizontal line graphed above has a y-intercept of (0, −2) and no x-intercept. The vertical line graphed above has an x-intercept (3, 0) and no y-intercept.   Try this! Find the x- and y-intercepts: 4 x − y = 2 .
