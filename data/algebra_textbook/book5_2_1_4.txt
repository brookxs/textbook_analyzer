More Operations That Produce Equivalent Equations Here are two more operations that produce equivalent equations. Multiplying Both Sides of an Equation by a Nonzero Quantity. Mul- tiplying both sides of an equation by a nonzero quantity does not change the solution set. That is, if a = b, and c != 0, then multiplying both sides of the equation by c produces the equivalent equation ac = bc. 80 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Dividing Both Sides of an Equation by a Nonzero Quantity. Dividing both sides of an equation by a nonzero quantity does not change the solution set. That is, if a = b, and c != 0, then dividing both sides of the equation by c produces the equivalent equation a c = b c . Like addition and subtraction, multiplication and division are inverse opera- tions. The inverse of multiplication is division. If we start with a number x and multiply by a number a, then dividing the result by the same number a returns us to the original number x. In symbols, a · x a = x. That is, dividing by a “undoes” the effect of multiplying by a and returns us to the original number x. The inverse of division is multiplication. If we start with a number x and divide by a number a, then multiplying the result by the same number a returns us to the original number x. In symbols, a · x a = x. That is, multiplying by a “undoes” the effect of dividing by a and returns us to the original number x. Let’s look at an example where dividing both sides of the equation by the same amount produces an equivalent equation that is the solution to the original equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Solve −2.1x = 0.42 for x.Solve for x: −3.6x = 0.072 Solution: To undo the effect of multiplying by −2.1, we divide both sides of 2.1. SOLVING EQUATIONS: ONE STEP 81 the equation by −2.1. −2.1x = 0.42 Original equation. −2.1x −2.1 = 0.42 −2.1 Dividing both sides by −2.1produces an equivalent equation. x = −2 On the left, dividing by −2.1 “undoes” the effect of multiplying by −2.1 and returns x. On the right, divide: 0.42/(−2.1) = −2. Therefore, the solution of the equation is −2. Check: To check, substitute the solution −2 into the original equation. −2.1x = 0.42 Original equation. −2.1(−2) = 0.42 Substitute −2 for x. 0.42 = 0.42 On the left, multiply: −2.1(−2) = 0.42 The fact that the last line of the check is a true statement guarantees that −2 is a solution of −2.1x = 0.42.
