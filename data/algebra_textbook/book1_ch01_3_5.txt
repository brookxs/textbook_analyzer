The Prime Factorization Of A Whole Number The following method provides a way of finding the prime factorization of a whole number. The examples that follow will use the method and make it more clear. Divide the number repeatedly by the smallest prime number that will divide into the number without a remainder. When the prime number used in step 1 no longer divides into the given number without a remainder, repeat the process with the next largest prime number. Continue this process until the quotient is 1. The prime factorization of the given number is the product of all these prime divisors.
