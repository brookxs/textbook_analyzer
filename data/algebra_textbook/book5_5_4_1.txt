Negating a Polynomial Before attempting subtraction of polynomials, let’s first address how to negate or “take the opposite” of a polynomial. First recall that negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. Negating. If a is any number, then −a = (−1)a. That is, negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. We can use this property to simplify −(a + b). First, negating is identical to multiplying by −1. Then we can distribute the −1. −(a+ b) = (−1)(a+ b) Negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. = (−1)a+ (−1)b Distribute the −1. = −a+ (−b) Simplify: (−1)a = −a and (−1)b = −b. = −a− b Subtraction means add the opposite. 336 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Thus, −(a + b) = −a − b. However, it is probably simpler to note that the minus sign in front of the parentheses simply changed the sign of each term inside the parentheses. Negating a sum. When negating a sum of terms, the effect of the minus sign is to change each term in the parentheses to the opposite sign. −(a+ b) = −a− b Let’s look at this principle in the next example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify: −(−3x2 + 4x− 8)Simplify: −(2x2 − 3x+ 9) Solution: First, negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. Then distribute the −1. − (−3x2 + 4x− 8) = (−1)(−3x2 + 4x− 8) Negating is equivalent to multiplying by −1. = (−1)(−3x2) + (−1)(4x)− (−1)(8) Distribute the −1. = 3x2 + (−4x)− (−8) Simplify: (−1)(−3x2) = 3x2, (−1)(4x) = −4x, and and (−1)(8) = −8. = 3x2 − 4x+ 8 Subtraction means add the opposite. Alternate solution: As we saw above, a negative sign in front of a parentheses simply changes the sign of each term inside the parentheses. So it is much more efficient to write −(−3x2 + 4x− 8) = 3x2 − 4x+ 8, simply changing the sign of each term inside the parentheses.Answer: −2x2 + 3x− 9 !
