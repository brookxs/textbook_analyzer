Coefficients We know that multiplication is a description of repeated addition. For example, describes Suppose some quantity is represented by the letter . The multiplication de­scribes . It is now easy to see that specifies 5 of the quantities represented by . In the expression , 5 is called the numerical coefficient, or more simply, the coefficient of . Coefficient The coefficient of a quantity records how many of that quantity there are. Since constants alone do not record the number of some quantity, they are not usually considered as numerical coefficients. For example, in the expression , the coefficient of is 7. (There are 7 x's.) is 2. (There are 2 y 's.) is . (There are z 's.) The constant 12 is not considered a numerical coefficient.  When the numerical coefficient of a variable is 1, we write only the variable and not the coefficient. For example, we write rather than . It is clear just by looking at that there is only one. Coefficients We know that multiplication is a description of repeated addition.
