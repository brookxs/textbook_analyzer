Definition of Parallel and Perpendicular Parallel lines Lines in the same plane that do not intersect; their slopes are the same. are lines in the same plane that never intersect. Two nonvertical lines in the same plane, with slopes m 1 and m 2 , are parallel if their slopes are the same, m 1 = m 2 . Consider the following two lines: Consider their corresponding graphs: Both lines have a slope m = 3 4 and thus are parallel. Perpendicular lines Lines in the same plane that intersect at right angles; their slopes are opposite reciprocals. are lines in the same plane that intersect at right angles (90 degrees). Two nonvertical lines in the same plane, with slopes m 1 and m 2 , are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is −1: m 1 ⋅ m 2 = − 1 . We can solve for m 1 and obtain m 1 = − 1 m 2 . In this form, we see that perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals, or opposite reciprocals Two real numbers whose product is −1. Given a real number a b , the opposite reciprocal is − b a . . For example, if given a slope then the slope of a perpendicular line is the opposite reciprocal: The mathematical notation m ⊥ reads “m perpendicular.” We can verify that two slopes produce perpendicular lines if their product is −1. Geometrically, we note that if a line has a positive slope, then any perpendicular line will have a negative slope. Furthermore, the rise and run between two perpendicular lines are interchanged. Perpendicular lines have slopes that are opposite reciprocals, so remember to find the reciprocal and change the sign. In other words, Determining the slope of a perpendicular line can be performed mentally. Some examples follow. Given slope Slope of perpendicular line m = 1 2 m ⊥ = − 2 m = − 3 4 m ⊥ = 4 3 m = 3 m ⊥ = − 1 3 m = − 4 m ⊥ = 1 4   Example 1: Determine the slope of a line parallel to y = − 5 x + 3 . Solution: Since the given line is in slope-intercept form, we can see that its slope is m = − 5 . Thus the slope of any line parallel to the given line must be the same, m ∥ = − 5 . The mathematical notation m ∥ reads “m parallel.” Answer: m ∥ = − 5   Example 2: Determine the slope of a line perpendicular to 3 x − 7 y = 21 . Solution: First, solve for y and express the line in slope-intercept form. In this form, we can see that the slope of the given line is m = 3 7 , and thus m ⊥ = − 7 3 .
