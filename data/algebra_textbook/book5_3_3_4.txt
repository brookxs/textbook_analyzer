The Geometry of the Slope of a Line We begin our geometrical discussion of the slope of a line with an example, calculating the slope of a line passing through the points P (2, 3) and Q(8, 8). Before we begin we’ll first calculate the change in y and the change in x by sub- tracting the coordinates of point P (2, 3) from the coordinates of point Q(8, 8). Slope = ∆y ∆x = 8− 3 8− 2 = 5 6 Thus, the slope of the line through the points P (2, 3) and Q(8, 8) is 5/6. To use a geometric approach to finding the slope of the line, first draw the line through the points P (2, 3) and Q(8, 8) (see Figure 3.53). Next, draw a right triangle with sides parallel to the horizontal and vertical axes, using the points P (2, 3) and Q(8, 8) as vertices. As you move from point P to point R in Figure 3.53, note that the change in x is ∆x = 6 (count the tick marks1). 1When counting tick marks, make sure you know the amount each tick mark represents. For example, if each tick mark represents two units, and you count six tick marks when evaluating the change in x, then ∆x = 12. 3.3. RATES AND SLOPE 193 As you then move from point R to point Q, the change in y is ∆y = 5 (count the tick marks). Thus, the slope is ∆y/∆x = 5/6, precisely what we got in the previous computation. −1 10 10 −1 x y ∆x = 6 ∆y = 5 P (2, 3) Q(8, 8) R(8, 3) Figure 3.53: Determining the slope of the line from the graph. −1 10 10 −1 x y ∆y = 5 ∆x = 6 P (2, 3) Q(8, 8) R(3, 8) Figure 3.54: Determining the slope of the line from the graph. For contrast, in Figure 3.54, we started at the point P (2, 3), then moved upward Rise over run. In Figure 3.54, we start at the point P (2, 3), then “rise” 5 units, then “run” 6 units to the right. For this reason, some like to think of the slope as “rise over run.” 5 units and right 6 units. However, the change in y is still ∆y = 5 and the change in x is still ∆x = 6 as we move from point P (2, 3) to point Q(8, 8). Hence, the slope is still ∆y/∆x = 5/6. Consider a second example shown in Figure 3.55. Note that the line slants downhill, so we expect the slope to be a negative number. −1 10 10 −1 x y ∆y = −4 ∆x = 6 P (2, 7) Q(8, 3) R(2, 3) Figure 3.55: Determining the slope of the line from the graph. −1 10 10 −1 x y ∆x = 6 ∆y = −4 P (2, 7) Q(8, 3) R(8, 7) Figure 3.56: Determining the slope of the line from the graph.

As you move from point P to point R in Figure 3.55, the change in y is ∆y = −4 194 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING (count the tick marks and note that your values of y are decreasing as you move from P to R). As you move from point R to point Q, the change is x is ∆x = 6 (count the tick marks and note that your values of x are increasing as you move from R to Q). Thus, the slope is ∆y/∆x = −4/6, or −2/3. Note that the slope is negative, as anticipated. In Figure 3.56, we’ve drawn our triangle on the opposite side of the line. In this case, as you move from point P to point R in Figure 3.56, the change in x is ∆x = 6 (count the tick marks and note that your values of x are increasing as you move from P to R). As you move from point R to point Q, the change is y is ∆y = −4 (count the tick marks and note that your values of y are decreasing as you move from R to Q). Thus, the slope is still ∆y/∆x = −4/6, or −2/3. We can verify our geometrical calculations of the slope by subtracting the coordinates of the point P (2, 7) from the point Q(8, 3). Slope = ∆y ∆x = 3− 7 8− 2 = −4 6 = −2 3 This agrees with the calculations made in Figures 3.55 and 3.56. Let’s look at a final example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Sketch the line passing through the point (−2, 3) with slopeSketch the line passing through the point (−4, 2) with slope −1/4. −2/3. Solution: The slope is −2/3, so the line must go downhill. In Figure 3.57, we start at the point P (−2, 3), move right 3 units to the point R(1, 3), then move down 2 units to the point Q(1, 1). Draw the line through the points P and Q and you are done. In Figure 3.58, we take a different approach that results in the same line. Start at the point P ′(−2, 3), move downward 4 units to the point R′(−2,−1), then right 6 units to the point Q′(4,−1). Draw a line through the points P ′ and Q′ and you are done. The triangle &PQR in Figure 3.57 is similar to the triangle &P ′Q′R′ in Figure 3.58, so their sides are proportional.

The slope of a line is the rate at which the dependent variable is changing with respect to the independent variable. If y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable, then the slope is Slope = ∆y ∆x , where ∆y is the change in y (difference in y) and ∆x is the change in x (difference in x). 2. If a line has positive slope, then the line slants uphill as you “sweep your eyes from left to right.” If two lines have positive slope, then the line with the larger slope rises more quickly. 3. If a line has negative slope, then the line slants downhill as you “sweep your eyes from left to right.” If two lines have negative slope, then the line having the slope with the larger magnitude falls more quickly. 4. Horizontal lines have slope zero. 5. Vertical lines have undefined slope. 196 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING ! ! !
