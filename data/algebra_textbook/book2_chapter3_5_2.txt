Finding Equations Using a Point and the Slope Given any point on a line and its slope, we can find the equation of that line. Begin by applying the slope formula with a given point ( x 1 ,   y 1 ) and a variable point ( x ,   y ) . The equation y − y 1 =   m ( x − x 1 ) is called the point-slope form of a line Any nonvertical line can be written in the form y − y 1 =   m ( x − x 1 ) , where m is the slope and ( x 1 ,   y 1 ) is any point on the line. . Any nonvertical linear equation can be written in this form. It is useful for finding the equation of a line given the slope and any ordered pair solution.   Example 7: Find the equation of the line with slope m = 1 2 passing through (4, −1). Solution: Use point-slope form, where m = 1 2 and ( x 1 ,   y 1 ) = ( 4 , − 1 ) . At this point, we must choose to present the equation of our line in either standard form or slope-intercept form. In this textbook, we will present our lines in slope-intercept form. This facilitates future graphing. Answer: y = 1 2 x − 3   Example 8: Find the equation of the line passing through (−5, 3) with slope m = − 2 5 . Solution: Substitute (−5, 3) and m = − 2 5 into point-slope form. Answer: y = − 2 5 x + 1   It is always important to understand what is occurring geometrically. Compare the answer for the last example to the corresponding graph below. The geometric understanding is important because you will often be given graphs from which you will need to determine a point on the line and the slope.   Example 9: Find an equation of the given graph: Solution: Between the points (1, 1) to (3, 0), we can see that the rise is −1 unit and the run is 2 units. The slope of the line is m = r i s e r u n = − 1 2 = − 1 2 . Use this and the point (3, 0) to find the equation as follows: Answer: y = − 1 2 x + 3 2   Example 10: Find the equation of the line passing through (−1, 1) and (7, −1). Solution: Begin by calculating the slope using the slope formula. Next, substitute into point-slope form using one of the given points; it does not matter which point is used. Use m = − 1 4 and the point (−1, 1). Answer: y = − 1 4 x + 3 4   Try this! Find the equation of the line passing through (4, −5) and (−4, 1).
