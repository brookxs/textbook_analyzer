1.4 Decimal Notation Every rational number can be expressed using decimal notation. To change a fraction into its decimal equivalent, divide the numerator of the fraction by its denominator. In some cases the process will terminate, leaving a zero remain- der. However, in other cases, the remainders will begin to repeat, providing a decimal representation that repeats itself in blocks. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Change each of the following fractions into decimals.Change 24/7 to a decimal. (a) 39 80 (b) 4 11 Solution: We perform two divisions, the one on the left to change 39/80 to a decimal, the one on the right to find a decimal representation for 4/11. 0.4875 80)39.0000 32 0 7 00 6 40 600 560 400 400 0 0.3636 11)4.0000 3 3 70 66 40 33 70 66 4 On the left, the division process terminates with a zero remainder. Hence, 39/80 = 0.4875 is called a terminating decimal. On the right, the remainders repeat in a pattern and the quotient also repeats in blocks of two. Hence, 4/11 = 0.3636 . . . is called a repeating decimal. We can also use a repeating bar to write 4/11 = 0.36. The block under the repeating bar repeats itself indefinitely.Answer: 3.428571 ! Vice-versa, any terminating decimal can be expressed as a fraction. You need only count the number of digits after the decimal point and use the same number of zeros in your denominator. You Try It!

DECIMAL NOTATION 49 In example (a), there are three dig- its after the decimal point, so we place the number over 1000, which has three zeros after the one. 0.055 = 55 1000 = 11 200 In example (b), there are two digits after the decimal point, so we place the number over 100, which has two zeros after the one. 3.36 = 336 100 = 84 25 Answer: 9/20 ! As we saw in Example 1, the repeating decimal 0.36 is equivalent to the fraction 4/11. Indeed, any repeating decimal can be written as a fraction. For example, 0.3 = 1/3 and 0.142857 = 1/7. In future courses you will learn a technique for changing any repeating decimal into an equivalent fraction. However, not all decimals terminate or repeat. For example, consider the decimal 0.42422422242222..., which neither terminates nor repeats. This number cannot be expressed using repeating bar notation because each iteration generates one additional 2. Be- cause this number neither repeats nor terminates, it cannot be expressed as a fraction. Hence, 0.42422422242222... is an example of an irrational number. Irrational numbers. If a number cannot be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers, q != 0, then the number is called an irrational number. Real numbers.

Sign rules for addition. When adding two decimal numbers, use the follow- ing rules: • To add two decimals with like signs, add their magnitudes and prefix their common sign. 50 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS • To add two decimals with unlike signs, subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger, then prefix the sign of the decimal number having the larger magnitude. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify: (a) −2.3 + (−0.015) and (b) −8.4 + 6.95Simplify: −22.6 + 18.47 Solution: In part (a), note that we have like signs. Hence, we add the mag- nitudes and prefix the common sign. −2.3 + (−0.015) = −2.315 2.300 +0.015 2.315 In part (b), note that we have unlike signs. Thus, we first subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger magnitude, then prefix the sign of the decimal num- ber with the larger magnitude. −8.4 + 6.95 = −1.45 8.40 −6.95 1.45 Hence, −2.3 + (−0.015) = −2.315 and −8.4 + 6.95 = −1.45.Answer: −4.13 ! Subtraction still means “add the opposite.” You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify: (a) −5.6− 8.4 and (b) −7.9− (−5.32)Simplify: −22.6− 18.47 Solution: In part (a), first we add the oppposite. Then we note that we have like signs. Hence, we add the magnitudes and prefix the common sign. −5.6− 8.4 = −5.6 + (−8.4) = −14.0 5.6 +8.4 14.0 In part (b), first we add the opposite. Then we note that we have unlike signs. Thus, we first subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger magnitude, then prefix the sign of the decimal number with the larger magnitude. −7.9− (−5.32) = −7.9 + 5.32 = −2.58 7.90 −5.32 2.58 Hence, −5.6− 8.4 = −14.0 and −7.9− (−5.32) = −2.58.Answer: −41.07 ! 1.4. DECIMAL NOTATION 51  || Multiplication and Division of Decimals The sign rules for decimal multiplication and division are the same as the sign rules used for integers and fractions. Sign Rules for multiplication and division. When multiplying or dividing two decimal numbers, use the following rules: • Like signs give a positive result. • Unlike signs give a negative result. Multiplication of decimal numbers is fairly straightforward. First multiply the magnitudes of the numbers, ignoring the decimal points, then count the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in each factor. Place the decimal point in the product so that the number of digits to the right of the decimal points equals the sum of number of digits to the right of the decimal point in each factor. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify: (−1.96)(2.8) Simplify: (−12.5)(−23.4) Solution: Multiply the magnitudes. The first decimal number has two digits to the right of the decimal point, the second has one digit to the right of the decimal point. Thus, we must place a total of three digits to the right of the decimal point in the product. (−1.96)(2.8) = −5.488 1.96 ×2.8 1 568 3 92 5.488 Note that unlike signs yield a negative product. Answer: 292.50 ! When dividing signed decimal numbers, ignore the signs and divide the magnitudes. Push the decimal point in the divisor to the end of the divisor, then move the decimal point in the dividend an equal number of spaces. This sets the decimal point in the quotient. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Simplify: −4.392÷ (−0.36) Simplify: −5.76/3.2 Solution. Divide the magnitudes. Move the decimal in the divisor to the end of the divisor. Move the decimal in the dividend an equal number of places (two places) to the right. 52 CHAPTER 1.

Hence, −4.392÷ (−0.36) = 12.2.Answer: −1.8 !  || Order of Operations Decimal numbers obey the same Rules Guiding Order of Operations as do the integers and fractions. Rules Guiding Order of Operations. When evaluating expressions, pro- ceed in the following order. 1. Evaluate expressions contained in grouping symbols first. If grouping symbols are nested, evaluate the expression in the innermost pair of grouping symbols first. 2. Evaluate all exponents that appear in the expression. 3. Perform all multiplications and divisions in the order that they appear in the expression, moving left to right. 4.

Next, substitute 2/5 for x in the open parentheses. −3.2x+ 5 = −3.2 ( ) + 5 Replace x with open parentheses. = −3.2 ( 2 5 ) + 5 Substitute 2/5 for x. 54 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS One approach is to change 2/5 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator. Thus, 2/5 = 0.4. = −3.2(0.4) + 5 Replace 2/5 with 0.4. = −1.28 + 5 Multiply: −3.2(0.4) = −1.28. = 3.72 Add: −1.28 + 5 = 3.72. Thus, if x = 2/5, then −3.2x+ 5 = 3.72.Answer: 8.725 ! As we saw in Example 2, we can easily change a terminating decimal into a fraction by placing the number (without the decimal point) over the proper power of ten. The choice of the power of ten should match the number of digits to the right of the decimal point. For example: 0.411 = 411 1000 and 3.11 = 311 100 and 15.1111 = 151111 10000 Note that the number of zeros in each denominator matches the number of digits to the right of the decimal point.

DECIMAL NOTATION 55  || Rounding Using the Graphing Calculator Here is the algorithm for rounding a decimal number to a particular place. Rules for rounding. To round a number to a particular place, follow these steps: 1. Mark the place you wish to round to. The digit in this place is called the rounding digit. 2. Mark the digit in the place to the immediate right of the rounding digit. This is called the test digit. a) If the test digit is greater than or equal to 5, add 1 to the rounding digit, then replace all digits to the right of the rounding digit with zeros. Trailing zeros to the right of the decimal point may be deleted. b) If the test digit is less than 5, keep the rounding digit the same, then replace all digits to the right of the rounding digit with zeros. Trailing zeros to the right of the decimal point may be deleted. You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Use your graphing calculator to evaluate 125x3−17.5x+44.8 at x = −3.13.

THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Figure 1.15: Evaluate 125x3 − 17.5x+ 44.8 at x = −3.13. Because the test digit is greater than or equal to 5, add 1 to the rounding digit, then replace all digits to the right of the rounding digit with zeros. −3733.462125≈ −3733.500000 Delete the trailing zeros from end of the fractional part of a decimal.
