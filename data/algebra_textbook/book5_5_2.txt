5.2 Polynomials We begin with the definition of a term. Term. A term is either a single number (called a constant term) or the product of a number and one or more variables. For example, each of the following is a term. −5 − 3x2 12y2z3 13a2bc3 Note how the first term is a single number, while the remaining terms are products of a number and one or more variables. For example, −3x2 is the product of −3, x, and x. Coefficient. When a term is a product of a number and one or more variables, the number is called the coefficient of the term. In the case of a term that is a single number, the number itself is called the coefficient. Thus, for example, the coefficients of the terms −5 − 3x2 12y2z3 13a2bc3 are −5, −3, 12, and 13, respectively. Degree. The degree of a term is the sum of the exponents on each variable of the term. A constant term (single number with no variables) has degree zero. Thus, for example, the degrees of the terms −5 − 3x2 12y2z3 13a2bc3 are 0, 2, 5, and 6, respectively. In the last example, note that 13a2bc3 is equivalent to 13a2b1c3, so adding exponents, we get: Degree of 13a2bc3 = Degree of 13a2b1c3 = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 Monomial. The words monomial and term are equivalent. Thus, −5 − 3x2 12y2z3 13a2bc3 are monomials. 5.2. POLYNOMIALS 309 Binomial. A binomial is a mathematical expression containing exactly two terms, separated by plus or minus signs. For example, each of the mathematical expressions 2x+ 3y − 3a2 − 3b2 xy + 7 − 3x2y + 5xy2 is a binomial. Each expression has exactly two terms. Trinomial. A trinomial is a mathematical expression containing exactly three terms, separated by plus or minus signs. For example, each of the mathematical expressions 2x2 + 3x+ 7 a2 + 2ab+ b2 x4 − 2x2y2 + 3y4 is a trinomial. Each expression has exactly three terms. A bicycle has two wheels, a binomial has two terms. A tricycle has three wheels, a trinomial has three terms. But once we get past three terms, the assignment of special names ceases and we use the generic word polynomial, which means “many terms.” Polynomial. A polynomial is a many-termed mathematical expression, with terms separated by plus or minus signs. The coefficients of a polynomial are the coefficients of its terms. Each of the previous expressions, 12y2z3 − 3a2 − 3b2 x4 − 2x2y2 + 3y4 though assigned the particular names monomial, binomial, and trinomial, re- spectively, are also “many-termed” expressions and can also be called polyno- mials. However, because the word polynomial means “many terms,” we can also use the word polynomial to describe mathematical expressions with more than three terms, such as: x4 − 4x3y + 6x2y2 − 4xy3 + y4 The coefficients of x4 − 4x3y + 6x2y2 − 4xy3 + y4 are 1, −4, 6, −4, and 1. 5.2 Polynomials We begin with the definition of a term.

A binomial is a mathematical expression containing exactly two terms, separated by plus or minus signs.

POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify the following polynomial expression, arranging yourSimplify the following polynomial, and arrange your answer in ascending powers of x: 3x2−5x3+8x+9x2−7x+2x3 answer in descending powers of x. Once you’ve completed that task, make a second arrangement, ordering your terms in ascending powers of x. 2x3 + 7x− 3x2 + 11x+ 8x2 + 11 + 15x Solution: In order to arrange our answer in descending powers of x, we want to place the term with the highest power of x first and the term with the lowest power of x last. We use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup, then we combine like terms. 2x3 + 7x− 3x2 + 11x+ 8x2 + 11 + 15x = 2x3 + (−3x2 + 8x2) + (7x+ 11x+ 15x) + 11 = 2x3 + 5x2 + 33x+ 11 Note how the powers of x start at 3, then go down in order. To arrange our final answer in ascending powers of x, we put the lowest power of x first, then the highest power of x last, regrouping and combining like terms. 2x3 + 7x− 3x2 + 11x+ 8x2 + 11 + 15x = 11 + (7x+ 11x+ 15x) + (−3x2 + 8x2) + 2x3 = 11 + 33x+ 5x2 + 2x3 Note how we start with the constant term, then the powers of x increase in order.Answer: x+ 12x2 − 3x3 ! When we have a polynomial in a single variable, such as the polynomial in Example 1, arranging the terms in ascending or descending order is fairly straightforward. However, a polynomial in two or more variables is a bit more difficult, and sometimes impossible, to arrange in a decent order. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Simplify the following polynomial expression, then arrangeSimplify the following polynomial, and arrange your answer in descending powers of x: −4x2y2 + 3xy3+ 6x3y − xy3 + 2x2y2 your answer in descending powers of x. x3 + 2xy2 − 6x2y + y3 − 3xy2 + 4x2y Solution: We’ll again use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup, putting the terms with the highest powers of x 5.2. POLYNOMIALS 311 first, then follow with terms containing lower powers of x in order. x3 + 2xy2 − 6x2y + y3 − 3xy2 + 4x2y = x3 + (−6x2y + 4x2y) + (2xy2 − 3xy2) + y3 = x3 − 2x2y − xy2 + y3 Note that this is a very natural order, the powers of x decrease while simulta- neously the powers of y increase. Answer: 6x3y − 2x2y2 + 2xy3 ! Not all examples will have nice ordering presented in Example 2, with the powers of one variable descending while the powers of the other variable simul- taneously ascends. Sometimes we have to make some very subjective choices on the ordering of terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify the following polynomial expression, then arrange Simplify the following polynomial, and arrange your answer in ascending powers of b: 5a3b2 + 4ab3 − 2a2b+ 3a3b2 − ab3 your answer in some sort of reasonable order. a3b3 + 2a2b− 3a2b3 + 4a3b3 + 5a4 + 3a2b+ b5 Solution: Let’s try to arrange the terms so that the powers of a descend. Again, we use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup. a3b3 + 2a2b− 3a2b3 + 4a3b3 + 5a4 + 3a2b+ b5 = 5a4 + (a3b3 + 4a3b3) + (2a2b + 3a2b)− 3a2b3 + b5 = 5a4 + 5a3b3 + 5a2b− 3a2b3 + b5 Note that in our final arrangement, the powers of a descend, but the powers of b bounce up and down, but at least we have the powers of a descending. That should help us spot if we’ve missed a term while simplifying the given problem. Answer: −2a2b+ 8a3b2 + 3ab3 !  || The Degree of a Polynomial To find the degree of a polynomial, locate the term of the polynomial having the highest degree. The degree of a polynomial. The degree of a polynomial is the degree of the term having the highest degree. 312 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Finding the degree of a polynomial of a single variable is pretty easy. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. What is the degree of the polynomial x3−4x2+5−6x+2x7?What is the degree of the polynomial 2x3 + 8x2 + 3x4 + 2x+ 10? Solution: First, let’s arrange the polynomial in descending powers of x. 2x7 + x3 − 4x2 − 6x+ 5 Arranging the polynomial in descending powers of x makes it easier to see that the term of the polynomial with the highest degree is 2x7. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is 7.Answer: 4 ! Finding the degree of a polynomial of more than one variable is a little bit trickier. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. What is the degree of the polynomial x4 − 2x3y7 + y5?What is the degree of the polynomial x2y4− 6x2y2 +5x2y5− 2xy? Solution: Note that the polynomial is already arranged in descending powers of x, an arrangement that is probably as good as we are going to get. In the following table, we list the degree of each term. Remember, the degree of any term is found by summing the exponents on its variables. Term Degree x4 4 −2x3y7 10 y5 5 Hence, the term with the highest degree is −2x3y7, making 10 the degree of the polynomial.Answer: 7 !  || Polynomial Functions First we define what we mean by a polynomial function. Polynomial function. A polynomial function is a function defined by a rule that assigns to each domain object a range object defined by a polynomial expression. 5.2. POLYNOMIALS 313 Advanced courses, such as multivariate calculus, frequently use polynomial functions of more than one variable such as f(x, y) = x2 + y2. However, in this course, our focus will be on polynomial functions of a single variable, such as p(x) = 3− 4x− 9x2 and q(x) = x3 − 9x2 + 11. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Given the polynomial function p(x) = x3− 8x− 11, evaluate Given the polynomial function p(x) = −3x2 + 7x+ 4, evaluate p(2). p(−3). Solution: To evaluate p(−3), first restate the function definition, then replace each occurrence of the variable x with open parentheses. p(x) = x3 − 8x− 11 Original function definition. p( ) = ( )3 − 8( )− 11 Replace each occurrence of x with open parentheses. Figure 5.11: Calculator check. Next, substitute −3 for x in the open parentheses prepared in the last step. p(−3) = (−3)3 − 8(−3)− 11 Substitute −3 for x in the open parentheses positions. p(−3) = −27− 8(−3)− 11 Exponent first: (−3)3 = −27. p(−3) = −27 + 24− 11 Multiply: −8(−3) = 24. p(−3) = −14 Add. Hence, p(−3) = −14. You can easily check this result on your calculator (see Figure 5.11). Answer: 6 !  || The Graph of a Polynomial Function One of the most important polynomial functions in all of mathematics and science is the polynomial having degree two. Quadratic polynomial. The second degree polynomial having the form p(x) = ax2 + bx+ c is called a quadratic polynomial. The graph of this polynomial is called a parabola. The parabola is approximately U-shaped. Some open upwards, some open downwards, depending on the sign of the leading term. In Figure 5.12, the leading term of the parabola p(x) = 2x2 − 8x + 6 has positive two as its 314 CHAPTER 5.

In Figure 5.13, the leading term of the parabola p(x) = −2x2− 8x− 6 has negative two as its coefficient, so it opens downward. The sign of the leading term of p(x) = ax2 + bx+ c determines whether the parabola opens up or down. • If a > 0, the parabola opens upward. • If a < 0, the parabola opens downward. The turning point of a parabola has a special name. The vertex of a parabola. The graph of the second degree polynomial p(x) = ax2+bx+c has a single turning point, called the vertex of the parabola. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Use your graphing calculator to sketch the graph of theUse your graphing calculator to sketch the graph of the quadratic polynomial p(x) = 2x2 − 5x− 4. quadratic polynomial p(x) = −3x2 + 12x+ 25. Solution: The degree of the polynomial p(x) = −3x2 + 12x + 25 is two, so it is a quadratic polynomial and its graph is a parabola. Moreover, its leading term has negative three as its coefficient, so we know that the parabola opens downward. Enter y = −3x2 + 12x + 25 as Y1=-3*X∧2+12*X+25 in the Y= menu (see the first image in Figure 5.14), then select 6:ZStandard from the ZOOM menu to produce the third image in Figure 5.14. Note that the graph in Figure 5.14 appears to have the U-shape of a parabola that opens downwards. Its vertex (turning point) is not visible, but one would 5.2.

We need to adjust the WINDOW parameters so that the vertex of the parabola is visible in the viewing screen. After some experimentation, we settle on the parameters shown in the first image in Figure 5.15, then push the GRAPH button to produce the second image in Figure 5.15.

POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS When the degree of the polynomial is larger than two, the number of turning points of the graph might increase. This makes for some very interesting curves. In more advanced courses, such as intermediate and college algebra, you will be introduced to a variety of techniques that will help you determine appropriate viewing windows for the graphs of these higher degree polynomials. However, in this introductory section, we will assist you by suggesting a good viewing window for each polynomial, one that will allow you to see all of the turning points of the graph of the polynomial.
