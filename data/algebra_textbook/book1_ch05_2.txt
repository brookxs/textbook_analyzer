 || Types of Equations Identity Some equations are always true. These equations are called identities. Identities are equations that are true for all acceptable values of the variable, that is, for all values in the domain of the equation. 5x = 5x is true for all acceptable values of x . y + 1 = y + 1 is true for all acceptable values of y .2 + 5 = 7 is true, and no substitutions are necessary. Contradiction Some equations are never true. These equations are called contradictions. Contradictions are equations that are never true regardless of the value substituted for the variable. x = x + 1 is never true for any acceptable value of x . 0  ·  k = 14 is never true for any acceptable value of k . 2 = 1 is never true. Conditional Equation The truth of some equations is conditional upon the value chosen for the variable. Such equations are called conditional equations. Conditional equations are equations that are true for at least one replacement of the variable and false for at least one replacement of the variable. x + 6 = 11 is true only on the condition that x = 5. y − 7 = − 1 is true only on the condition that y = 6 .  || Solutions and Equivalent Equations Solutions and Solving an Equation The collection of values that make an equation true are called solutions of the equation. An equation is solved when all its solutions have been found. Equivalent Equations Some equations have precisely the same collection of solutions. Such equations are called equivalent equations. The equations are equivalent equations because the only value that makes each one true is 3.  || Literal Equations Literal Equations Some equations involve more than one variable. Such equations are called literal equations. An equation is solved for a particular variable if that variable alone equals an expression that does not contain that particular variable. The following equations are examples of literal equations. y = 2x + 7 . It is solved for y . d = r t . It is solved for d . I = p r t . It is solved for I . . It is solved for z . y + 1 = x + 4 . This equation is not solved for any particular variable since no variable is isolated.  || Solving Equation of the form x + a = b and x − a = b Recall that the equal sign of an equation indicates that the number represented by the expression on the left side is the same as the number represented by the expression on the right side. This suggests the following procedures: We can obtain an equivalent equation (an equation having the same solutions as the original equation) by adding the same number to both sides of the equation. We can obtain an equivalent equation by subtracting the same number from both sides of the equation. We can use these results to isolate x , thus solving for x . Example 5.4. Solving x + a = b for x Example 5.5. Solving x − a = b for x Example 5.6. Method for Solving x + a = b and x − a = b for x To solve the equation x + a = b for x , subtract a from both sides of the equation. To solve the equation x − a = b for x , add a to both sides of the equation.  ||
