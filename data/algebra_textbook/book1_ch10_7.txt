 || The Five-Step Method We are now in a position to study some applications of quadratic equations. Quadratic equations can arise from a variety of physical (applied) and mathematical (logical) problems. We will, again, apply the five-step method for solving word problems. Five-Step Method of Solving Word Problems Step 1:   Let x (or some other letter) represent the unknown quantity. Step 2:   Translate the verbal expression to mathematical symbols and form an equation. Step 3:   Solve this equation. Step 4:   Check the solution by substituting the result into the equation found in step 2. Step 5:   Write a conclusion. Remember, step 1 is very important. ALWAYS START BY INTRODUCING A VARIABLE. Once the quadratic equation is developed (step 2), try to solve it by factoring. If factoring doesn’t work, use the quadratic formula. A calculator may help to make some of the calculations a little less tedious.  || Astrophysical Problem Exercise 10.7.33. A very interesting application of quadratic equations is determining the length of a solar eclipse (the moon passing between the earth and sun). The length of a solar eclipse is found by solving the quadratic equation ( a + b t ) 2 + ( c + d t ) 2 = ( e + f t ) 2 for t . The letters a,b,c,d,e, and f are constants that pertain to a particular eclipse. The equation is a quadratic equation in t and can be solved by the quadratic formula (and definitely a calculator). Two values of t will result. The length of the eclipse is just the difference of these t -values. The following constants are from a solar eclipse that occurred on August 3, 431 B.C.Determine the length of this particular solar eclipse.  ||
