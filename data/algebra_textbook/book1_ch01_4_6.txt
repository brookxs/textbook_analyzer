Finding The Least Common Multiple Finding the LCM To find the LCM of two or more numbers, Write the prime factorization of each number, using exponents on repeated factors. Write each base that appears in each of the prime factorizations. To each base, attach the largest exponent that appears on it in the prime factorizations. The LCM is the product of the numbers found in step 3.
