Squaring a Binomial Before demonstrating the correct procedure for squaring a binomial, we will first share one of the most common mistakes made in algebra. Warning! This is incorrect! One of the most common mistakes made in algebra is the assumption that: (a+ b)2 = a2 + b2 The fact that this is incorrect is easily checked. Substitute 3 for a and 4 for b. (3 + 4)2 = 32 + 42 72 = 32 + 42 49 = 9 + 16 Clearly this is incorrect! So what is the correct answer? First, (a+ b)2 = (a+ b)(a+ b). We can now use the FOIL shortcut. 1. Multiply the terms in the “First” positions: a2 2. Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and add the results mentally: ab+ ab = 2ab 3. Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions: b2 Hence, the correct answer is (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2. This leads us to the following shortcut for squaring a binomial. 376 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Squaring a binomial. To square a binomial, such as (a + b)2, perform the following steps: 1. Square the “First” term: a2 2. Multiply the “First” and “Last” terms and double the result: 2ab 3. Square the “Last” term: b2 That is: (a+ b)2 = a2 + 2ab+ b2 You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Use the squaring a binomial shortcut to expand: (x+ 5)2Simplify: (x + 3)2 Solution: Follow these steps: 1. Square the first term: x2 2. Multiply the “First” and “Last” terms and double the result: 2(x)(5) = 10x 3. Square the “Last” term: 52 = 25 Thus: (x+ 5)2 = x2 + 2(x)(5) + (5)2 = x2 + 10x+ 25 Note: You should practice this pattern until you can go straight from the problem statement to the answer without writing down any intermediate work, as in (x+ 5)2 = x2 + 10x+ 25.Answer: x2 + 6x+ 9 ! Comment. Students often refuse to learn the “squaring a binomial” shortcut, noting that they can just as easily use the FOIL technique or a simple appli- cation of the distributive property to arrive at the same result. Unfortunately, failure to learn the “squaring a binomial” shortcut will severely handicap stu- dents, as this pattern is an important component of many procedures in future mathematics courses. You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Use the squaring a binomial shortcut to expand: (3x+ 7y)2Simplify: (2y + 3z)2 Solution: Follow these steps: 5.7. SPECIAL PRODUCTS 377 1. Square the first term: (3x)2 = 9x2 2. Multiply the “First” and “Last” terms and double the result: 2(3x)(7y) = 42xy 3. Square the “Last” term: (7y)2 = 49y2 Thus: (3x+ 7y)2 = (3x)2 + 2(3x)(7y) + (7y)2 = 9x2 + 42xy + 49y2 Note: You should practice this pattern until you can go straight from the problem statement to the answer without writing down any intermediate work, as in (3x+ 7y)2 = 9x2 + 42xy + 49y2. Answer: 4y2 + 12yz + 9z2 ! In the next example, when squaring a binomial with a minus sign, we take care of the minus sign by “adding the opposite.” You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Use the squaring a binomial shortcut to expand: (4a2−5b3)2 Simplify: (3x4 − 5z2)2 Solution: Add the opposite: (4a2−5b3)2 = (4a2+(−5b3))2. Now follow these steps: 1. Square the first term: (4a2)2 = 16a4 2. Multiply the “First” and “Last” terms and double the result: 2(4a2)(−5b3) = −40a2b3 3. Square the “Last” term: (−5b3)2 = 25b6 Thus: (4a2 − 5b3)2 = (4a2 + (−5b3))2 = (4a2)2 + 2(4a2)(−5b3) + (−5b3)2 = 16a4 − 40a2b3 + 25b6 Note: You should practice this pattern until you can go straight from the problem statement to the answer without writing down any intermediate work, as in (4a2 − 5b3)2 = 16a4 − 40a2b3 + 25b6. Answer: 9x8 − 30x4z2 + 25z4 ! Example 10 shows us that if we are squaring a difference, the middle term will be minus. That is, the only difference between (a+ b)2 and (a− b)2 is the sign of the middle term. 378 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Squaring a binomial. The shortcuts for squaring a binomial are: (a+ b)2 = a2 + 2ab+ b2 (a− b)2 = a2 − 2ab+ b2 You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Use the squaring a binomial shortcut to expand: (x3− y3)2Simplify: (a2 − 3b5)2 Solution: Use the pattern (a− b)2 = a2 − 2ab+ b2. Square the “First” term, multiply the “First” and “Last” terms and double the result, then square the “Last” term. Because of the minus sign, the middle term will be minus, but all other terms are plus. (x3 − y3)2 = (x3)2 − 2(x3)(y3) + (y3)2 = x6 − 2x3y3 + y6 Answer: a4 − 6a2b5 + 9b10 !
