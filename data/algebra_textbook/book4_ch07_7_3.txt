Finding the Percentage Sample Set A Example 7.36.  Thus, 15 is 30% of 50. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.1.. Example 7.37.  Thus, 34.2 is 36% of 95. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.1.. Example 7.38.  A salesperson, who gets a commission of 12% of each sale she makes, makes a sale of $8,400.00. How much is her commission? We need to determine what part of $8,400.00 is to be taken. What part indicates percentage. Thus, the salesperson's commission is $1,008.00. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.2.. Example 7.39.  A girl, by practicing typing on her home computer, has been able to increase her typing speed by 110%. If she originally typed 16 words per minute, by how many words per minute was she able to increase her speed? We need to determine what part of 16 has been taken. What part indicates percentage. Thus, the girl has increased her typing speed by 17.6 words per minute. Her new speed is 16 + 17.6 = 33.6 words per minute. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.3.. Example 7.40.  A student who makes $125 a month working part-time receives a 4% salary raise. What is the student's new monthly salary? With a 4% raise, this student will make 100% of the original salary + 4% of the original salary. This means the new salary will be 104% of the original salary. We need to determine what part of $125 is to be taken. What part indicates percentage. Thus, this student's new monthly salary is $130. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.4.. Example 7.41.  An article of clothing is on sale at 15% off the marked price. If the marked price is $24.95, what is the sale price? Since the item is discounted 15%, the new price will be 100% – 15% = 85% of the marked price. We need to determine what part of 24.95 is to be taken. What part indicates percentage. Thus, the sale price of the item is $21.21. Practice Set A Exercise 7.7.1. (Go to Solution) What number is 42% of 85? Exercise 7.7.2.
