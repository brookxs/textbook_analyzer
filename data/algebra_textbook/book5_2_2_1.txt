Variables on Both Sides of the Equation It is not uncommon that the variable you are solving for appears in terms on both sides of the equation. Consider, for example, the equation 2x+3 = 5−7x. In cases like this, it is helpful to have a general understanding of what it means to “solve for x.” Solve for x. When asked to solve an equation for x, the goal is to manipulate the equation into the final form x = “Stuff”, 2.2. SOLVING EQUATIONS: MULTIPLE STEPS 91 where “Stuff” is a valid mathematical expression that may contain other vari- ables, mathematical symbols, etc., but it must not contain any occurrence of the variable x. In this section, “Stuff” will always be a single number, but in Section 2.4, Formulae, “Stuff” will take on added complexity, including variables other than x. Strategy for solving for x. When asked to solve an equation for x, a common strategy is to isolate all terms containing the variable x on one side of the equation and move all terms not containing the variable x to the other side of the equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve 3− 2x = 5x+ 9 for x. Solve for x: 4x+ 7 = 5− 8xSolution: We need to isolate all terms containing x on one side of the equation. We can eliminate 5x from the right-hand side of 3−2x = 5x+9 by subtracting 5x from both sides of the equation. 3− 2x = 5x+ 9 Original equation. 3− 2x− 5x = 5x+ 9− 5x Subtract 5x from both sides. 3− 7x = 9 Simplify both sides. Next, eliminate 3 from the left-hand side of the last equation by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation. 3− 7x− 3 = 9− 3 Subtract 3 from both sides. −7x = 6 Simplify both sides. Note how we have isolated all terms containing x on one side of the equation. −7x −7 = 6 −7 Divide both sides by −7. x = −6 7 Simplify both sides. 92 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Check: To check the solution, substitute −6/7 for x in the original equation. 3− 2x = 5x+ 9 Original equation. 3− 2 ( −6 7 ) = 5 ( −6 7 ) + 9 Substitute −6/7 for x. 3 + 12 7 = −30 7 + 9 Multiply: −2(−6/7) = 12/7 and 5(−6/7) = −30/7. 21 7 + 12 7 = −30 7 + 63 7 Make equivalent fractions with a common denominator. 33 7 = 33 7 Add. Because the last line of the check is a true statement, this guarantees that −6/7 is a solution of the original equation.Answer: x = −1/6 !
