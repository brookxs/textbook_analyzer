Division of Signed Numbers To determine the signs in a division problem, recall that since 12 = 3⋅4 This suggests that   since ( + ) = ( + )( + ) What is ? − 12 = ( − 3)( − 4) suggests that . That is,   ( + ) = ( − )( − ) suggests that What is ? − 12 = (3)( − 4) suggests that . That is,   ( − ) = ( + )( − ) suggests that What is ? − 12 = ( − 3)(4) suggests that . That is,   ( − ) = ( − )( + ) suggests that We have the following rules for dividing signed numbers. Rules for Dividing Signed Numbers Dividing signed numbers: To divide two real numbers that have the same sign, divide their absolute values. The quotient is positive. To divide two real numbers that have opposite signs, divide their absolute values. The quotient is negative. Sample Set B Find the following quotients. Example 10.39.  Divide these absolute values. Since the numbers have opposite signs, the quotient is negative. Thus . Example 10.40.  Divide these absolute values. Since the numbers have the same signs, the quotient is positive. Thus, . Example 10.41.  Divide these absolute values. Since the numbers have opposite signs, the quotient is negative. Thus, . Practice Set B Find the following quotients. Exercise 10.7.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 10.7.8. (Go to Solution) Exercise 10.7.9. (Go to Solution) Exercise 10.7.10. (Go to Solution) Sample Set C Example 10.42.  Find the value of . Using the order of operations and what we know about signed numbers, we get, Practice Set C Exercise 10.7.11. (Go to Solution) Find the value of .
