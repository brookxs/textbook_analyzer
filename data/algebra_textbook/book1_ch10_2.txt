 || Standard Form of A Quadratic Equation In Chapter (Section 5.1) we studied linear equations in one and two variables and methods for solving them. We observed that a linear equation in one variable was any equation that could be written in the form a x + b = 0, a ≠ 0, and a linear equation in two variables was any equation that could be written in the form a x + b y = c, where a and b are not both 0. We now wish to study quadratic equations in one variable. Quadratic Equation A quadratic equation is an equation of the form a x 2 + b x + c = 0, a ≠ 0. The standard form of the quadratic equation is a x 2 + b x + c = 0, a ≠ 0. For a quadratic equation in standard form a x 2 + b x + c = 0, a is the coefficient of x 2 . b is the coefficient of x. c is the constant term.  || Zero-Factor Property Our goal is to solve quadratic equations. The method for solving quadratic equations is based on the zero-factor property of real numbers. We were introduced to the zero-factor property in Section Section 8.2. We state it again. Zero-Factor Property If two numbers a and b are multiplied together and the resulting product is 0, then at least one of the numbers must be 0. Algebraically, if a  ·  b = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0, or both a = 0 and b = 0.  ||
