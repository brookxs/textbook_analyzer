Factoring Hints Factoring trinomials may take some practice, but with time and experience, you will be able to factor much more quickly. There are some clues that are helpful in determining the factors of the third term that when added yield the coefficient of the middle term. Factoring Hints Look at the sign of the last term: If the sign is positive, we know that the two factors must have the same sign, since ( + ) ( + ) = ( + ) and ( − ) ( − )  =  ( + ) . The two factors will have the same sign as the sign of the middle term. If the sign is negative, we know that two factors must have opposite signs, since ( + ) ( − ) = ( − ) and ( − ) ( + )  =  ( − ) .
