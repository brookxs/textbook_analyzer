Missing Factor Statements The equation 8 ⋅ M = 32 is a missing factor statement. We can find the value of M that makes this statement true by dividing (since we know that 32 ÷ 8 = 4). Finding the Missing Factor To find the missing factor in a missing factor statement, divide the product by the known factor. missing factor = (product) ÷ (known factor) Missing factor statements can be used to answer such questions as of what number is ? What part of is ? Sample Set B Now, using missing factor = (product) ÷ (known factor) We get Thus, of 6 is . For convenience, let's convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions. Now, using missing factor = (product)÷(known factor) we get Thus, of is . Practice Set B Exercise 4.7.4. (Go to Solution) of what number is ? Exercise 4.7.5. (Go to Solution) of what number is ? Exercise 4.7.6. (Go to Solution) What part of is ? Exercise 4.7.7. (Go to Solution) What part of is ? Missing Factor Statements The equation 8 ⋅ M = 32 is a missing factor statement.
