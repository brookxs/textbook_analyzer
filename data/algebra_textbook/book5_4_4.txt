4.4 Applications of Linear Systems In this section we create and solve applications that lead to systems of linear equations. As we create and solve our models, we’ll follow the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions from Chapter 2, Section 5. However, instead of setting up a single equation, we set up a system of equations for each application. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. In geometry, two angles that sum to 90◦ are called comple-If the second of two complementary angles is 6 degrees larger than 3 times the first angle, find the degree measure of both angles. mentary angles. If the second of two complementary angles is 30 degrees larger than twice the first angle, find the degree measure of both angles. Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Our variable dictionary will take the form of a diagram, naming the two complementary angles α and β. α β 2. Set up a Systems of Equations. The “second angle is 30 degrees larger than twice the first angle” becomes β = 30 + 2α (4.31) Secondly, the angles are complementary, meaning that the sum of the angles is 90◦. α + β = 90 (4.32) Thus, we have a system of two equations in two unknowns α and β. 3. Solve the System. As equation (4.31) is already solved for β, let use the substitution method and substitute 30 + 2α for β in equation (4.32). α + β = 90 Equation (4.32). α + (30 + 2α) = 90 Substitute 30 + 2α for β. 3α + 30 = 90 Combine like terms. 3α = 60 Subtract 30 from both sides. α = 20 Divide both sides by 3. 4.4. APPLICATIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEMS 283 4. Answer the Question. The first angle is α = 20 degrees. The second angle is: β = 30 + 2α Equation (4.31). β = 30 + 2(20) Substitute 20 for α. β = 70 Simplify. 5. Look Back. Certainly 70◦ is 30◦ larger than twice 20◦. Also, note that 20◦ + 70◦ = 90◦, so the angles are complementary. We have the correct solution. Answer: 21 and 69 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2.

Find the width and length of the rectangle. rectangle is 10 feet less than twice the width. Find the width and length of the rectangle. Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Our variable dictionary will take the form of a diagram, naming the width and length W and L, respectively. L W L W 2. Set up a System of Equations. The perimeter is found by summing the four sides of the rectangle. P = L+W + L+W P = 2L+ 2W We’re told the perimeter is 280 feet, so we can substitute 280 for P in the last equation. 280 = 2L+ 2W 284 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2, giving the following result: L+W = 140 Secondly, we’re told that the “length is 10 feet less than twice the width.” This translates to: L = 2W − 10 Thus, the system we need to solve is: L+W = 140 (4.33) L = 2W − 10 (4.34) 3. Solve the System. As equation (4.34) is already solved for L, let use the substitution method and substitute 2W − 10 for L in equation (4.33). W + L = 140 Equation (4.33). W + (2W − 10) = 140 Substitute 2W − 10 for L. 3W − 10 = 140 Combine like terms. 3W = 150 Add 10 to both sides. W = 50 Divide both sides by 3. 4. Answer the Question. The width is W = 50 feet. The length is: L = 2W − 10 Equation (4.34). L = 2(50)− 10 Substitute 50 for W . L = 90 Simplify. Thus, the length is L = 90 feet. 5. Look Back. Perhaps a picture, labeled with our answers might best demonstrate that we have the correct solution. Remember, we found that the width was 50 feet and the length was 90 feet. 90 50 90 50 Note that the perimeter is P = 90 + 50 + 90 + 50 = 280 feet. Secondly, note that the length 90 feet is 10 feet less than twice the width. So we have the correct solution. Answer: length = 134, width = 50 ! 4.4. APPLICATIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEMS 285 You Try It!

How many quarters does she have? quarters. He has 22 coins in all. How many dimes does he have? Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Let D represent the number of dimes and let Q represent the number of quarters. 2. Set up a System of Equations. Using a table to summarize information is a good strategy. In the first column, we list the type of coin. The second column gives the number of each type of coin, and the third column contains the value (in cents) of the number of coins in Pascal’s pocket. Number of Coins Value (in cents) Dimes D 10D Quarters Q 25Q Totals 22 325 Note that D times, valued at 10 cents apiece, are worth 10D cents. Sim- ilarly, Q quarters, valued at 25 cents apiece, are worth 25Q cents. Note also how we’ve change $3.25 to 325 cents. The second column of the table gives us our first equation. D +Q = 22 (4.35) The third column of the table gives us our second equation. 10D + 25Q = 325 (4.36) 3. Solve the System. Because equations (4.35) and (4.36) are both in stan- dard form Ax + By = C, we’ll use the elimination method to find a solution. Because the question asks us to find the number of dimes in Pascal’s pocket, we’ll focus on eliminating the Q-terms and keeping the D-terms. −25D − 25Q = −550 Multiply equation (4.35) by −25. 10D + 25Q = 325 Equation (4.36). −15D = −225 Add the equations. Dividing both sides of the last equation by −15 gives us D = 15. 4. Answer the Question. The previous solution tells us that Pascal has 15 dimes in his pocket. 286 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS 5. Look Back. Again, summarizing results in a table might help us see if we have the correct solution. First, because we’re told that Pascal has 22 coins in all, and we found that he had 15 dimes, this means that he must have 7 quarters. Number of Coins Value (in cents) Dimes 15 150 Quarters 7 175 Totals 22 325 Fifteen dimes are worth 150 cents, and 7 quarters are worth 175 cents. That’s a total of 22 coins and 325 cents, or $3.25. Thus we have the correct solution. Answer: 24 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Rosa inherits $10,000 and decides to invest the money inEileen inherits $40,000 and decides to invest the money in two accounts, part in a certificate of deposit that pays 3% interest per year, and the rest in a mutual fund that pays 6% per year. At the end of the first year, her investments earn a total of $2,010 in interest. Find the amount invested in each account. two accounts, one portion in a certificate of deposit that pays 4% interest per year, and the rest in a mutual fund that pays 5% per year. At the end of the first year, Rosa’s investments earn a total of $420 in interest. Find the amount invested in each account. Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Let C represent the amount invested in the certificate of deposit and M represent the amount invested in the mutual fund. 2. Set up a System of Equations. We’ll again use a table to summarize information. Rate Amount invested Interest Certificate of Deposit 4% C 0.04C Mutual Fund 5% M 0.05M Totals 10,000 420 At 4%, the interest earned on a C dollars investment is found by taking 4% of C (i.e., 0.04C). Similarly, the interest earned on the mutual fund is 0.05M . 4.4. APPLICATIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEMS 287 The third column of the table gives us our first equation. The total investment is $10,000. C +M = 10000 The fourth column of the table gives us our second equation. The total interest earned is the sum of the interest earned in each account. 0.04C + 0.05M = 420 Let’s clear the decimals from the last equation by multiplying both sides of the equation by 100. 4C + 5M = 42000 Thus, the system we need to solve is: C +M = 10000 (4.37) 4C + 5M = 42000 (4.38) 3. Solve the System. Because equations (4.37) and (4.38) are both in stan- dard form Ax + By = C, we’ll use the elimination method to find a solution. We’ll focus on eliminating the C-terms. −4C − 4M = −40000 Multiply equation (4.37) by −4. 4C + 5M = 42000 Equation (4.38). M = 2000 Add the equations. Thus, the amount invested in the mutual fund in M = $2, 000. 4. Answer the Question. The question asks us to find the amount invested in each account. So, substitute M = 2000 in equation (4.37) and solve for C. C +M = 10000 Equation (4.37). C + 2000 = 10000 Substitute 2000 for M . C = 8000 Subtract 2000 from both sides. Thus C = $8, 000 was invested in the certificate of deposit. 5. Look Back. First, note that the investments in the certificate of deposit and the mutual fund, $8,000 and $2,000 respectively, total $10,000. Let’s calculate the interest on each investment: 4% of $8,000 is $320 and 5% of $2,000 is $100. Rate Amount invested Interest Certificate of Deposit 4% 8, 000 320 Mutual Fund 5% 2, 000 100 Totals 10,000 420 288 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS Note that the total interest is $420, as required in the problem statement. Thus, our solution is correct. Answer: $13,000 in the certificate of deposit, $27,000 in the mutual fund. ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 5.

If you were a shop owner, how many pounds of peanuts and cashews should you mix to make 50 pounds of a peanut-cashew mixture costing $0.95 per pound? Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Let P be the number of pounds of peanuts used and let C be the number of pounds of cashews used. 2. Set up a System of Equations. We’ll again use a table to summarize information. Cost per pound Amount (pounds) Cost Peanuts $0.50 P 0.50P Cashews $1.25 C 1.25C Totals $0.95 50 0.95(50)=47.50 At $0.50 per pound, P pounds of peanuts cost 0.50P . At $1.25 per pound, C pounds of cashews cost 1.25C. Finally, at $0.95 per pound, 50 pounds of a mixture of peanuts and cashews will cost 0.95(50), or $47.50. The third column of the table gives us our first equation. The total number of pounds of mixture is given by the following equation: P + C = 50 The fourth column of the table gives us our second equation. The total cost is the sum of the costs for purchasing the peanuts and cashews. 0.50P + 1.25C = 47.50 Let’s clear the decimals from the last equation by multiplying both sides of the equation by 100. 50P + 125C = 4750 Thus, the system we need to solve is: P + C = 50 (4.39) 50P + 125C = 4750 (4.40) 4.4. APPLICATIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEMS 289 3. Solve the System. Because equations (4.39) and (4.40) are both in stan- dard form Ax + By = C, we’ll use the elimination method to find a solution. We’ll focus on eliminating the P -terms. −50P − 50C = −2500 Multiply equation (4.39) by −50. 50P + 125C = 4750 Equation (4.40). 75C = 2250 Add the equations. Divide both sides by 75 to get C = 30 pounds of cashews are in the mix. 4. Answer the Question. The question asks for both amounts, peanuts and cashews. Substitute C = 30 in equation (4.39) to determine P . P + C = 50 Equation (4.39). P + 30 = 50 Substitute 30 for C. P = 20 Subtract 30 from both sides. Thus, there are P = 20 pounds of peanuts in the mix. 5. Look Back. First, note that the amount of peanuts and cashews in the mix is 20 and 30 pounds respectively, so the total mixture weighs 50 pounds as required. Let’s calculate the costs: for the peanuts, 0.50(20), or $10, for the cashews, 1.25(30) = 37.50. Cost per pound Amount (pounds) Cost Peanuts $0.50 20 $10.00 Cashews $1.25 30 $37.50 Totals $0.95 50 47.50 Note that the total cost is $47.50, as required in the problem statement.
