The Meaning and Notation for Volume The product (length unit)(length unit)(length unit) = (length unit)3 , or cubic length unit (cu length unit), can be interpreted physically as the volume of a three-dimensional object. Volume The volume of an object is the amount of cubic length units contained in the object. For example, 4 cu mm means that 4 cubes, 1 mm on each side, would precisely fill some three-dimensional object. (The cubes may have to be cut and rearranged so they match the shape of the object.)
