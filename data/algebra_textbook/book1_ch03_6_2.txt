Multiplication of Signed Numbers Let us consider first the product of two positive numbers. Multiply: 3⋅5 . 3⋅5 means 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 . This suggests that (positive number)⋅(positive number) = positive number . More briefly, ( + )( + ) = + . Now consider the product of a positive number and a negative number. Multiply: (3)( − 5) . (3)( − 5) means ( − 5) + ( − 5) + ( − 5) = − 15 . This suggests that (positive number)⋅(negative number) = negative number More briefly, ( + )( – ) = – . By the commutative property of multiplication, we get (negative number)⋅(positive number) = negative number More briefly, ( – )( + ) = – . The sign of the product of two negative numbers can be determined using the following illustration: Multiply − 2 by, respectively, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0,  − 1,  − 2,  − 3,  − 4 . Notice that when the multiplier decreases by 1, the product increases by 2. We have the following rules for multiplying signed numbers. Rules for Multiplying Signed Numbers To multiply two real numbers that have the same sign, multiply their absolute values. The product is positive. opposite signs, multiply their absolute values. The product is negative. Multiplication of Signed Numbers Let us consider first the product of two positive numbers. Multiply: 3⋅5 . 3⋅5 means 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 .
