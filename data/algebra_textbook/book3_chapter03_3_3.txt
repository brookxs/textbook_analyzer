Mixture Problems Example:  How much of a 10% vinegar solution should be added to 2 cups of a 30% vinegar solution to make a 20% solution? Let x be the unknown amount of 10% solution. Write an equation for the amount of vinegar in each mixture: (amount of vinegar in first solution) + (amount of vinegar in second solution) = (amount of vinegar in total solution) 0.1x + 0.3(2) = 0.2(x + 2) 0.1x + 0.6 = 0.2x + 0.4 -0.1x = -0.2 x = 2 cups Mixture Problems Example:  How much of a 10% vinegar solution should be added to 2 cups of a 30% vinegar solution to make a 20% solution?
