Problems Involving Money and Percents Whenever setting up an equation involving a percentage, we usually need to convert the percentage to a decimal or fraction. If the question asks for a percentage, then do not forget to convert your answer to a percent at the end. Also, when money is involved, be sure to round off to two decimal places.   Example 10: If a pair of shoes costs $52.50 including a 7 1 4 % tax, what is the original cost of the item before taxes are added? Solution: Begin by converting 7 1 4 % to a decimal. The amount of tax is this rate times the original cost of the item. The original cost of the item is what you are asked to find. Use this equation to solve for c, the original cost of the item. Answer: The cost of the item before taxes is $48.95. Check this by multiplying $48.95 by 0.0725 to obtain the tax and add it to this cost.   Example 11: Given a 5 1 8 % annual interest rate, how long will it take $1,200 to yield $307.50 in simple interest? Solution: Organize the data needed to use the simple interest formula I = p r t . Given interest for the time period: I = $ 307.50 Given principal: p = $ 1200 Given rate: r = 5 1 8 % = 5.125 % = 0.05125 Next, substitute all of the known quantities into the formula and then solve for the only unknown, t. Answer: It takes 5 years for $1,200 invested at 5 1 8 % to earn $307.50 in simple interest.   Example 12: Mary invested her total savings of $3,400 in two accounts. Her mutual fund account earned 8% last year and her CD earned 5%. If her total interest for the year was $245, how much was in each account? Solution: The relationship between the two unknowns is that they total $3,400. When a total is involved, a common technique used to avoid two variables is to represent the second unknown as the difference of the total and the first unknown. The total interest is the sum of the interest earned from each account. Interest earned in the mutual fund: I = P r t = x ⋅ 0.08 ⋅ 1 = 0.08 x Interest earned in the CD: I = P r t = ( 3,400 − x ) ⋅ 0.05 ⋅ 1 = 0.05 ( 3,400 − x ) This equation models the problem with one variable. Solve for x. Back substitute. Answer: Mary invested $2,500 at 8% in a mutual fund and $900 at 5% in a CD.   Example 13: Joe has a handful of dimes and quarters that values $5.30. He has one fewer than twice as many dimes than quarters. How many of each coin does he have? Solution: Begin by identifying the variables. To determine the total value of a number of coins, multiply the number of coins by the value of each coin. For example, 5 quarters have a value $0.25 ⋅ 5 = $1.25. Solve for the number of quarters, q. Back substitute into 2q − 1 to find the number of dimes. Answer: Joe has 12 quarters and 23 dimes. Check by multiplying $0.25 ⋅ 12 = $3.00 and $0.10 ⋅ 23 = $2.30. Then add to obtain the correct amount: $3.00 + $2.30 = $5.30.   Try this! A total amount of $5,900 is invested in two accounts. One account earns 3.5% interest and another earns 4.5%. If the interest for 1 year is $229.50, then how much is invested in each account? Answer: $3,600 is invested at 3.5% and $2,300 at 4.5%.
