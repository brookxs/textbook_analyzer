Zero as an Exponent Using the quotient rule for exponents, we can define what it means to have 0 as an exponent. Consider the following calculation: Eight divided by 8 is clearly equal to 1, and when the quotient rule for exponents is applied, we see that a 0 exponent results. This leads us to the definition of zero as an exponent x 0 = 1 ; any nonzero base raised to the 0 power is defined to be 1. , where x ≠ 0 : It is important to note that 0 0 is undefined. If the base is negative, then the result is still +1. In other words, any nonzero base raised to the 0 power is defined to be 1. In the following examples, assume all variables are nonzero.   Example 16: Simplify: a. ( − 5 ) 0 b. − 5 0 Solution: a. Any nonzero quantity raised to the 0 power is equal to 1. b. In the example − 5 0 , the base is 5, not −5. Answers: a. 1; b. −1   Example 17: Simplify: ( 5 x 3 y 0 z 2 ) 2 . Solution: It is good practice to simplify within the parentheses first. Answer: 25 x 6 z 4   Example 18: Simplify: ( − 8 a 10 b 5 5 c 12 d 14 ) 0 . Solution: Answer: 1   Try this! Simplify: 5 x 0 and ( 5 x ) 0 . Answer: 5 x 0 = 5 and ( 5 x ) 0 = 1 Video Solution Zero as an Exponent Using the quotient rule for exponents, we can define what it means to have 0 as an exponent.
