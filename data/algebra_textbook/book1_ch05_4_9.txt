Recognizing Identities and Contradictions As we noted in Section Section 5.2, some equations are identities and some are contradictions. As the problems of Sample Set D will suggest, Recognizing an Identity If, when solving an equation, all the variables are eliminated and a true statement results, the equation is an identity. Recognizing a Contradiction If, when solving an equation, all the variables are eliminated and a false statement results, the equation is a contradiction.
