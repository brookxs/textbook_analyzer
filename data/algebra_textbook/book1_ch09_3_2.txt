Perfect Squares Perfect Squares Real numbers that are squares of rational numbers are called perfect squares. The numbers 25 and are examples of perfect squares since 25 = 52 and and 5 and are rational numbers. The number 2 is not a perfect square since and is not a rational number. Although we will not make a detailed study of irrational numbers, we will make the following observation: Any indicated square root whose radicand is not a perfect square is an irrational number. The numbers and are each irrational since each radicand is not a perfect square. Perfect Squares Perfect Squares Real numbers that are squares of rational numbers are called perfect squares.
