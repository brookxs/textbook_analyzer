Multiplication in Terms of “Of” Recalling that the word "of" translates to the arithmetic operation of multiplica­tion, let's observe the following multiplications. Sample Set D Example 6.42.  Find 4.1 of 3.8. Translating "of" to "×", we get Thus, 4.1 of 3.8 is 15.58. Example 6.43.  Find 0.95 of the sum of 2.6 and 0.8. We first find the sum of 2.6 and 0.8. Now find 0.95 of 3.4 Thus, 0.95 of (2.6 + 0.8) is 3.230. Practice Set D Exercise 6.6.18. (Go to Solution) Find 2.8 of 6.4. Exercise 6.6.19. (Go to Solution) Find 0.1 of 1.3. Exercise 6.6.20. (Go to Solution) Find 1.01 of 3.6. Exercise 6.6.21. (Go to Solution) Find 0.004 of 0.0009. Exercise 6.6.22. (Go to Solution) Find 0.83 of 12. Exercise 6.6.23. (Go to Solution) Find 1.1 of the sum of 8.6 and 4.2.
