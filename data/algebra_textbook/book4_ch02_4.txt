 || Division with a Single Digit Divisor Our experience with multiplication of whole numbers allows us to perform such divisions as 75÷5. We perform the division by performing the corresponding multiplication, 5 × Q = 75. Each division we considered in Section 2.3 had a one-digit quotient. Now we will consider divisions in which the quotient may consist of two or more digits. For example, 75÷5. Let's examine the division 75÷5. We are asked to determine how many 5's are contained in 75. We'll approach the problem in the following way. Make an educated guess based on experience with multiplication. Find how close the estimate is by multiplying the estimate by 5. If the product obtained in step 2 is less than 75, find out how much less by subtracting it from 75. If the product obtained in step 2 is greater than 75, decrease the estimate until the product is less than 75. Decreasing the estimate makes sense because we do not wish to exceed 75. We can suggest from this discussion that the process of division consists of The Four Steps in Division an educated guess a multiplication a subtraction bringing down the next digit (if necessary) The educated guess can be made by determining how many times the divisor is contained in the dividend by using only one or two digits of the dividend. Sample Set A Example 2.23.  Find 75÷5. Rewrite the problem using a division bracket. Make an educated guess by noting that one 5 is contained in 75 at most 10 times.Since 7 is the tens digit, we estimate that 5 goes into 75 at most 10 times. Now determine how close the estimate is. 10 fives is 10 × 5 = 50. Subtract 50 from 75. Estimate the number of 5's in 25. There are exactly 5 fives in 25. Check: Thus, 75÷5 = 15. The notation in this division can be shortened by writing. Example 2.24.  Find 4,944÷8. Rewrite the problem using a division bracket. 8 goes into 49 at most 6 times, and 9 is in the hundreds column. We'll guess 600. Then, 8 × 600 = 4800. 8 goes into 14 at most 1 time, and 4 is in the tens column. We'll guess 10. 8 goes into 64 exactly 8 times. 600 eights + 10 eights + 8 eights = 618 eights. Check: Thus, 4,944÷8 = 618. As in the first problem, the notation in this division can be shortened by eliminating the subtraction signs and the zeros in each educated guess. Note Not all divisions end in zero. We will examine such divisions in a subsequent subsection. Practice Set A Perform the following divisions. Exercise 2.4.1. (Go to Solution) 126÷7 Exercise 2.4.2.

(Go to Solution) 757,125÷9  || Division with a Multiple Digit Divisor The process of division also works when the divisor consists of two or more digits. We now make educated guesses using the first digit of the divisor and one or two digits of the dividend. Sample Set B Example 2.25.  Find 2,232÷36. Use the first digit of the divisor and the first two digits of the dividend to make the educated guess. 3 goes into 22 at most 7 times. Try 7: 7 × 36 = 252 which is greater than 223. Reduce the estimate. Try 6: 6 × 36 = 216 which is less than 223. Divide 3 into 7 to estimate the number of times 36 goes into 72. The 3 goes into 7 at most 2 times. Try 2: 2 × 36 = 72. Check: Thus, 2,232÷36 = 62. Example 2.26.  Find 2,417,228÷802. First, the educated guess: 24÷8 = 3. Then 3 × 802 = 2406, which is less than 2417. Use 3 as the guess. Since 3 × 802 = 2406, and 2406 has four digits, place the 3 above the fourth digit of the dividend. Subtract: 2417 - 2406 = 11. Bring down the 2. The divisor 802 goes into 112 at most 0 times. Use 0. The 8 goes into 11 at most 1 time, and 1 × 802 = 802, which is less than 1122. Try 1. Subtract 1122 – 802 = 320 Bring down the 8. 8 goes into 32 at most 4 times. 4 × 802 = 3208. Use 4. Check: Thus, 2,417,228÷802 = 3,014. Practice Set B Perform the following divisions. Exercise 2.4.6. (Go to Solution) 1,376÷32 Exercise 2.4.7. (Go to Solution) 6,160÷55 Exercise 2.4.8. (Go to Solution) 18,605÷61 Exercise 2.4.9. (Go to Solution) 144,768÷48  || Division with a Remainder We might wonder how many times 4 is contained in 10. Repeated subtraction yields Since the remainder is less than 4, we stop the subtraction. Thus, 4 goes into 10 two times with 2 remaining. We can write this as a division as follows. Since 4 does not divide into 2 (the remainder is less than the divisor) and there are no digits to bring down to continue the process, we are done. We write or Sample Set C Example 2.27.  Find 85÷3. There are no more digits to bring down to continue the process. We are done. One is the remainder. Check: Multiply 28 and 3, then add 1. Thus, . Example 2.28.  Find 726÷23. Check: Multiply 31 by 23, then add 13. Thus, 726÷23 = 31R13. Practice Set C Perform the following divisions. Exercise 2.4.10. (Go to Solution) 75÷4 Exercise 2.4.11.

(Go to Solution) 41,196÷67  || Calculators The calculator can be useful for finding quotients with single and multiple digit divisors. If, however, the division should result in a remainder, the calculator is unable to provide us with the particular value of the remainder. Also, some calculators (most nonscientific) are unable to perform divisions in which one of the numbers has more than eight digits. Sample Set D Use a calculator to perform each division. Example 2.29.  328 ÷ 8 Table 2.7. Type 328 Press ÷ Type 8 Press = The display now reads 41. Example 2.30.  53 , 136 ÷ 82 Table 2.8. Type 53136 Press ÷ Type 82 Press = The display now reads 648. Example 2.31.  730 , 019 , 001 ÷ 326 We first try to enter 730,019,001 but find that we can only enter 73001900. If our calculator has only an eight-digit display (as most nonscientific calculators do), we will be unable to use the calculator to perform this division. Example 2.32.  3727 ÷ 49 Table 2.9. Type 3727 Press ÷ Type 49 Press = The display now reads 76.061224. This number is an example of a decimal number (see Section 6.1). When a decimal number results in a calculator division, we can conclude that the division produces a remainder. Practice Set D Use a calculator to perform each division. Exercise 2.4.15.
