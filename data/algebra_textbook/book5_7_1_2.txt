Raising to a Negative Integer We know what happens when you raise a number to −1, you invert the number or turn it upside down. But what happens when you raise a number to a negative integer other than negative one? As an example, consider the expression 3−2. Using the third law of expo- nents ((am)n = amn), we can write this expression in two equivalent forms. 1. Note that 3−2 is equivalent to (32)−1. They are equivalent because the third law of exponents instructs us to multiply the exponents when raising a power to another power. Finally, note that to evaluate (32)−1, we first square, then invert the result. 3−2 = (32)−1 Repeat base and multiply exponents. = 9−1 Simplify: 32 = 9. = 1 9 Simplify: 9−1 = 1/9. 2. Note that 3−2 is also equivalent to (3−1)2. They are equivalent because the third law of exponents instructs us to multiply the exponents when raising a power to another power. Finally, note that to evaluate (3−1)2, we first invert, then square the result. 3−2 = (3−1)2 Repeat base and multiply exponents. = ( 1 3 )2 Simplify: 3−1 = 1/3. = 1 9 Simplify: (1/3)2 = 1/9. Using either technique, 3−2 = 1/9. You can either square and invert, or you can invert and square. In each case, the 2 means “square” and the minus sign means “invert,” and this example shows that it doesn’t matter which you do first. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Simplify each of the following expressions: Simplify: ( 5 4 )−3 a) 5−3 b) (−4)−2 c) ( 3 5 )−2 d) ( −2 3 )−3 Solution: a) We’ll cube then invert. 5−3 = (53)−1 Repeat base, multiply exponents. = 125−1 Simplify: 53 = 125. = 1 125 Invert: 125−1 = 1/125. 7.1. NEGATIVE EXPONENTS 483 Note that the three means “cube” and the minus sign means “invert,” so it is possible to do all of this work mentally: cube 5 to get 125, then invert to get 1/125. b) We’ll square then invert. (−4)−2 = ((−4)2)−1 Repeat base, multiply exponents. = 16−1 Simplify: (−4)2 = 16. = 1 16 Invert: 16−1 = 1/16. Note that the two means “square” and the minus sign means “invert,” so it is possible to do all of this work mentally: square −4 to get 16, then invert to get 1/16. c) Again, we’ll square then invert.( 3 5 )−2 = (( 3 5 )2)−1 Repeat base, multiply exponents. = ( 9 25 )−1 Simplify: (3/5)2 = 9/25. = 25 9 Invert: (9/25)−1 = 25/9. Note that the two means “square” and the minus sign means “invert,” so it is possible to do all of this work mentally: square 3/5 to get 9/25, then invert to get 25/9. d) This time we’ll cube then invert.( −2 3 )−3 = (( −2 3 )3)−1 Repeat base, multiply exponents. = ( − 8 27 )−1 Simplify: (−2/3)3 = −8/27. = −27 8 Invert: (−8/27)−1 = −27/8. Note that the three means “cube” and the minus sign means “invert,” so it is possible to do all of this work mentally: cube −2/3 to get −8/27, then invert to get −27/8.
