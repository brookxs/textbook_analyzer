L W L W The perimeter (distance around) of the rectangle is found by summing its four sides, then combining like terms. P = L+W + L+W Summing the four sides. P = 2W + 2L Combine like terms. Problem: Solve P = 2W + 2L for L. Then, given that the perimeter is 300 feet and the width is 50 feet, use your result to calculate the length. Solution: We’re first asked to solve P = 2W + 2L for L. First, isolate all 116 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES terms containing the variable L on one side of the equation. P = 2W + 2L Original equation. P − 2W = 2W + 2L− 2W Subtract 2W from both sides. P − 2W = 2L Simplify. P − 2W 2 = 2L 2 Divide both sides by 2. P − 2W 2 = L Simplify. Note that the final result has L = “Stuff’, where “Stuff” contains no occurrence of the variable L. The second part of this example requests that we find the length of the rectangle, given that the perimeter is P = 300 feet and the width is W = 50 feet. To calculate the length, substitute P = 300 and W = 50 in L = (P − 2W )/2. L = P − 2W 2 Perimeter formula solved for L. L = 300− 2(50) 2 Substitute 300 for P , 50 for W . L = 300− 100 2 Multiply: 2(50) = 100. L = 200 2 Subtract: 300− 100 = 200. L = 100 Divide: 200/2 = 100. Hence, the length of the rectangle is 100 feet.Answer: L = 50 meters ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8.

FORMULAE 117 That is, the area of a triangle is “one-half the base times the height.” Problem: Solve the formula A = 12bh for h. Secondly, given that the area is A = 90 in2 (90 square inches) and the length of the base is 15 in (15 inches), find the height of the triangle. Solution: We’re first asked to solve A = (1/2)bh for h. Because the equation has fractions, the first step is to clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by the least common denominator. A = 1 2 bh Area of a triangle formula. 2(A) = 2 ( 1 2 bh ) Multiply both sides by 2. 2A = bh Simplify. Now, we already have all terms containing the variable h on one side of the equation, so we can solve for h by dividing both sides of the equation by b. 2A b = bh b Divide both sides by b. 2A b = h Simplify. Note that the final result has h = “Stuff’, where “Stuff” contains no occurrence of the variable h. The second part of this example requests that we find the height of the triangle, given that the area is A = 90 in2 and the length of the base is b = 15 in. To calculate the height of the triangle, substitute A = 90 and b = 15 in h = 2A/b. h = 2A b Area formula solved for h. h = 2(90) 15 Substitute 90 for A, 15 for b. h = 180 15 Multiply: 2(90) = 180. h = 12 Divide: 180/15 = 12.
