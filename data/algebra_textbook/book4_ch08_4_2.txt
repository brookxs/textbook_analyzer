The Distributive Property Distributive Property The distributive property is a characteristic of numbers that involves both addition and multiplication. It is used often in algebra, and we can use it now to obtain exact results for a multiplication. Suppose we wish to compute 3(2 + 5). We can proceed in either of two ways, one way which is known to us already (the order of operations), and a new way (the distributive property). Compute 3(2 + 5) using the order of operations. 3 ( 2 + 5 ) Operate inside the parentheses first: 2 + 5 = 7. 3 ( 2 + 5 ) = 3 ⋅ 7 Now multiply 3 and 7. 3 ( 2 + 5 ) = 3 ⋅ 7 = 21 Thus, 3(2 + 5) = 21. Compute 3(2 + 5) using the distributive property. We know that multiplication describes repeated addition. Thus, Thus, 3(2 + 5) = 21. Let's look again at this use of the distributive property. The 3 has been distributed to the 2 and 5. This is the distributive property. We distribute the factor to each addend in the parentheses. The distributive property works for both sums and differences.
