GCF of Monomials We next consider factorizations of monomials. For example, 6 x and x 4 are factors of 6 x 5 because 6 x 5 = 6 x ⋅ x 4 . Typically, there are many ways to factor a monomial. Some factorizations of 6 x 5 follow: Given two or more monomials, it will be useful to find the greatest common monomial factor of each. For example, consider 6 x 5 y 3 z and 8 x 2 y 3 z 2 . The variable part of these two monomials look very much like the prime factorization of natural numbers and, in fact, can be treated the same way. Steps for finding the GCF of monomials The product of the GCF of the coefficients and all common variable factors. are outlined in the following example.   Example 3: Find the GCF of 6 x 5 y 3 z and 8 x 2 y 3 z 2 . Solution: Step 1: Find the GCF of the coefficients. In this case, the G C F ( 6 ,   8 ) = 2 . Step 2: Determine the common variable factors with smallest exponents. In this case, the common variables with the smallest exponents are x 2 , y 3 , and z 1 . Step 3: The GCF of the monomials is the product of the common variable factors and the GCF of the coefficients. Therefore, Answer: 2 x 2 y 3 z   It is worth pointing out that the GCF in the previous example divides both expressions evenly: Furthermore, we can write the following: The factors 3 x 3 and 4 z share no common monomial factors other than 1; they are relatively prime.   Example 4: Determine the GCF of the following expressions: 30 x 6 y and 18 x 4 y 2 z . Solution: The prime factorizations of the coefficients are Thus the GCF(30, 18) = 2 ⋅ 3 = 6. Next, consider the variable part: The variable factors in common are x 4 and y. The factor z is not in common and we have Answer: 6 x 4 y   Example 5: Determine the GCF of the following three expressions: 12 a 5 b 2 ( a + b ) 5 , 60 a 4 b 3 c ( a + b ) 3 , and 24 a 2 b 7 c 3 ( a + b ) 2 . Solution: First, determine the GCF of the coefficients. The GCF ( 12, 60, 24 ) = 2 2 ⋅ 3 = 12 . Next, determine the common factors of the variable part: The variable factors in common are a 2 , b 2 , and ( a + b ) 2 . Therefore, Answer: 12 a 2 b 2 ( a + b ) 2 . Note that the variable c is not common to all three expressions and thus is not included in the GCF.   Try this! Determine the GCF of the following: 60 x 4 y 3 ( x + 2 y ) 7 , 45 x 2 y 5 ( x + 2 y ) 4 , and 30 x 7 y 7 ( x + 2 y ) 3 . Answer: 15 x 2 y 3 ( x + 2 y ) 3 Video Solution GCF of Monomials We next consider factorizations of monomials. For example, 6 x and x 4 are factors of 6 x 5 because 6 x 5 = 6 x ⋅ x 4 .
