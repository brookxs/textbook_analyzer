Point-Slope to Standard Form Let’s do an example where we have to put the point-slope form of a line in standard form. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Sketch the line passing through the points (−3,−4) andFind the standard form of the equation of the line that passes through the points (−2, 4) and (3,−3). (1, 2), then find the equation of the line in standard form. Solution: Plot the points (−3,−4) and (1, 2), then draw a line through them (see Figure 3.93). −5 5 −5 5 x y (−3,−4) (1, 2) Figure 3.93: The line through (−3,−4) and (1, 2). Use the points (−3,−4) and (1, 2) to calculate the slope. Slope = ∆y ∆x Slope formula. = 2− (−4) 1− (−3) Subtract coordinates of (−3,−4) from the coordinates of (1, 2). = 6 4 Simplify. = 3 2 Reduce. 3.6. STANDARD FORM OF A LINE 233 Let’s substitute (x0, y0) = (1, 2) and m = 3/2 in the point-slope form of the line. (Note: Substituting (x0, y0) = (−3,−4) and m = 3/2 would yield the same answer.) y − y0 = m(x− x0) Point-slope form. y − 2 = 3 2 (x− 1) Substitute: 3/2 for m, 1 for x0, and 2 for y0. The question requests that our final answer be presented in standard form. First we clear the fractions. If we fail to reduce the slope to lowest terms, then the equation of the line would be: y − 2 = 6 4 (x− 1) Multiplying both sides by 4 would give us the result 4y − 8 = 6x− 6, or equivalently: −6x+ 4y = 2 This doesn’t look like the same answer, but if we divide both sides by −2, we do get the same result. 3x− 2y = −1 This shows the importance of requiring A ≥ 0 and “re- ducing” the coefficients A, B, and C. It allows us to com- pare our answer with our col- leagues or the answers pre- sented in this textbook. y − 2 = 3 2 x− 3 2 Distribute the 3/2. 2 [y − 2] = 2 [ 3 2 x− 3 2 ] Multiply both sides by 2. 2y − 2[2] = 2 [ 3 2 x ] − 2 [ 3 2 ] Distribute the 2. 2y − 4 = 3x− 3 Multiply. Now that we’ve cleared the fractions, we must order the terms in the form Ax+By = C. We need to move the term 3x to the other side of the equation. 2y − 4− 3x = 3x− 3− 3x Subtract 3x from both sides. −3x+ 2y − 4 = −3 Simplify, changing the order on the left-hand side. To put this in the form Ax + By = C, we need to move the term −4 to the other side of the equation. −3x+ 2y − 4 + 4 = −3 + 4 Add 4 to both sides. −3x+ 2y = 1 Simplify. It appears that −3x+ 2y = 1 is in the form Ax+By = C. However, standard form requires that A ≥ 0. We have A = −3. To fix this, we multiply both sides by −1. −1 [−3x+ 2y] = −1 [1] Multiply both sides by −1. 3x− 2y = −1 Distribute the −1. Thus, the equation of the line in standard form is 3x− 2y = −1. Answer: 7x+ 5y = 6 ! 234 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING Point-Slope to Standard Form Let’s do an example where we have to put the point-slope form of a line in standard form. You Try It!
