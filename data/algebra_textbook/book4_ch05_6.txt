 || Simple Fractions and Complex Fractions Simple Fraction A simple fraction is any fraction in which the numerator is any whole number and the denominator is any nonzero whole number. Some examples are the following: Complex Fraction A complex fraction is any fraction in which the numerator and/or the denomina­tor is a fraction; it is a fraction of fractions. Some examples of complex fractions are the following:  || Converting Complex Fractions to Simple Fractions The goal here is to convert a complex fraction to a simple fraction. We can do so by employing the methods of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing fractions. Recall from Section 4.2 that a fraction bar serves as a grouping symbol separating the fractional quantity into two individual groups. We proceed in simplifying a complex fraction to a simple fraction by simplifying the numerator and the denom­inator of the complex fraction separately. We will simplify the numerator and denominator completely before removing the fraction bar by dividing. This tech­nique is illustrated in problems 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the section called “Sample Set A”. Sample Set A Convert each of the following complex fractions to a simple fraction. Example 5.20.  Convert this complex fraction to a simple fraction by performing the indicated division.
