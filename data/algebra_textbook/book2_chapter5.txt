 ||  || Product, Quotient, and Power Rule for Exponents If a factor is repeated multiple times, then the product can be written in exponential form An equivalent expression written using a rational exponent. x n . The positive integer exponent n indicates the number of times the base x is repeated as a factor. For example, Here the base is 5 and the exponent is 4. Exponents are sometimes indicated with the caret (^) symbol found on the keyboard: 5^4 = 5*5*5*5. Next consider the product of 2 3 and 2 5 , Expanding the expression using the definition produces multiple factors of the base, which is quite cumbersome, particularly when n is large. For this reason, we will develop some useful rules to help us simplify expressions with exponents. In this example, notice that we could obtain the same result by adding the exponents. In general, this describes the product rule for exponents x m ⋅ x n = x m + n ; the product of two expressions with the same base can be simplified by adding the exponents. . If m and n are positive integers, then In other words, when multiplying two expressions with the same base, add the exponents.   Example 1: Simplify: 10 5 ⋅ 10 18 . Solution: Answer: 10 23   In the previous example, notice that we did not multiply the base 10 times itself. When applying the product rule, add the exponents and leave the base unchanged.   Example 2: Simplify: x 6 ⋅ x 12 ⋅ x . Solution: Recall that the variable x is assumed to have an exponent of 1: x = x 1 . Answer: x 19   The base could be any algebraic expression.   Example 3: Simplify: ( x + y ) 9   ( x + y ) 13 . Solution: Treat the expression ( x + y ) as the base. Answer: ( x + y ) 22   The commutative property of multiplication allows us to use the product rule for exponents to simplify factors of an algebraic expression.   Example 4: Simplify: 2 x 8 y ⋅ 3 x 4 y 7 . Solution: Multiply the coefficients and add the exponents of variable factors with the same base. Answer: 6 x 12 y 8   Next, we will develop a rule for division by first looking at the quotient of 2 7 and 2 3 . Here we can cancel factors after applying the definition of exponents. Notice that the same result can be obtained by subtracting the exponents. This describes the quotient rule for exponents x m x n = x m − n ; the quotient of two expressions with the same base can be simplified by subtracting the exponents. . If m and n are positive integers and x ≠ 0 , then In other words, when you divide two expressions with the same base, subtract the exponents.   Example 5: Simplify: 12 y 15 4 y 7 . Solution: Divide the coefficients and subtract the exponents of the variable y. Answer: 3 y 8   Example 6: Simplify: 20 x 10 ( x + 5 ) 6 10 x 9 ( x + 5 ) 2 . Solution: Answer: 2 x ( x + 5 ) 4   Now raise 2 3 to the fourth power as follows: After writing the base 2 3 as a factor four times, expand to obtain 12 factors of 2. We can obtain the same result by multiplying the exponents. In general, this describes the power rule for exponents ( x m ) n = x m n ; a power raised to a power can be simplified by multiplying the exponents. . Given positive integers m and n, then In other words, when raising a power to a power, multiply the exponents.   Example 7: Simplify: ( y 6 ) 7 . Solution: Answer: y 42   To summarize, we have developed three very useful rules of exponents that are used extensively in algebra. If given positive integers m and n, then Product rule: x m ⋅ x n = x m + n Quotient rule: x m x n = x m − n   ,   x ≠ 0 Power rule: ( x m ) n = x m ⋅ n   Try this! Simplify: y 5 ⋅ ( y 4 ) 6 . Answer: y 29 Video Solution  || Power Rules for Products and Quotients Now we consider raising grouped products to a power. For example, After expanding, we have four factors of the product xy. This is equivalent to raising each of the original factors to the fourth power. In general, this describes the power rule for a product ( x y ) n = x n y n ; if a product is raised to a power, then apply that power to each factor in the product. . If n is a positive integer, then   Example 8: Simplify: ( 2 a b ) 7 . Solution: We must apply the exponent 7 to all the factors, including the coefficient, 2. If a coefficient is raised to a relatively small power, then present the real number equivalent, as we did in this example: 2 7 = 128 . Answer: 128 a 7 b 7   In many cases, the process of simplifying expressions involving exponents requires the use of several rules of exponents.   Example 9: Simplify: ( 3 x y 3 ) 4 . Solution: Answer: 81 x 4 y 12   Example 10: Simplify: ( 4 x 2 y 5 z ) 3 . Solution: Answer: 64 x 6 y 15 z 3   Example 11: Simplify: [ 5 ( x + y ) 3 ] 3 . Solution: Answer: 125 ( x + y ) 9   Next, consider a quotient raised to a power. Here we obtain four factors of the quotient, which is equivalent to the numerator and the denominator both raised to the fourth power. In general, this describes the power rule for a quotient ( x y ) n = x n y n ; if a quotient is raised to a power, then apply that power to the numerator and the denominator. . If n is a positive integer and y ≠ 0 , then In other words, given a fraction raised to a power, we can apply that exponent to the numerator and the denominator. This rule requires that the denominator is nonzero. We will make this assumption for the remainder of the section.   Example 12: Simplify: ( 3 a b ) 3 . Solution: First, apply the power rule for a quotient and then the power rule for a product. Answer: 27 a 3 b 3   In practice, we often combine these two steps by applying the exponent to all factors in the numerator and the denominator.   Example 13: Simplify: ( a b 2 2 c 3 ) 5 . Solution: Apply the exponent 5 to all of the factors in the numerator and the denominator. Answer:   a 5 b 10 32 c 15   Example 14: Simplify: ( 5 x 5 ( 2 x − 1 ) 4 3 y 7 ) 2 . Solution: Answer: 25 x 10 ( 2 x − 1 ) 8 9 y 14   It is a good practice to simplify within parentheses before using the power rules; this is consistent with the order of operations.   Example 15: Simplify: ( − 2 x 3 y 4 z x y 2 ) 4 . Solution: Answer: 16 x 8 y 8 z 4   To summarize, we have developed two new rules that are useful when grouping symbols are used in conjunction with exponents.

Answer: 64 x 6 ( x − y ) 9 27 y 3 z 15 Video Solution  || Zero as an Exponent Using the quotient rule for exponents, we can define what it means to have 0 as an exponent. Consider the following calculation: Eight divided by 8 is clearly equal to 1, and when the quotient rule for exponents is applied, we see that a 0 exponent results. This leads us to the definition of zero as an exponent x 0 = 1 ; any nonzero base raised to the 0 power is defined to be 1. , where x ≠ 0 : It is important to note that 0 0 is undefined. If the base is negative, then the result is still +1. In other words, any nonzero base raised to the 0 power is defined to be 1. In the following examples, assume all variables are nonzero.   Example 16: Simplify: a. ( − 5 ) 0 b. − 5 0 Solution: a. Any nonzero quantity raised to the 0 power is equal to 1. b. In the example − 5 0 , the base is 5, not −5. Answers: a. 1; b. −1   Example 17: Simplify: ( 5 x 3 y 0 z 2 ) 2 . Solution: It is good practice to simplify within the parentheses first.

Polynomials do not have variables in the denominator of any term. The degree of a term The exponent of the variable; if there is more than one variable in the term, the degree of the term is the sum their exponents. in a polynomial is defined to be the exponent of the variable, or if there is more than one variable in the term, the degree is the sum of their exponents. Recall that x 0 = 1 ; any constant term can be written as a product of x 0 and itself. Hence the degree of a constant term is 0. Term Degree 3 x 2 2 6 x 2 y 2 + 1 = 3 7 a 2 b 3 2 + 3 = 5 8 0 , since 8 = 8 x 0 2 x 1, since x = x 1 The degree of a polynomial The largest degree of all of its terms. is the largest degree of all of its terms.

(one term) 7 8 x 6 − 1 Binomial Polynomial with two terms. (two terms) 6 − 3 x 2 + x − 1 Trinomial Polynomial with three terms. (three terms) 2 5 x 3 − 2 x 2 + 3 x − 6 Polynomial An algebraic expression consisting of terms with real number coefficients and variables with whole number exponents. (many terms) 3 In this text, we will call polynomials with four or more terms simply polynomials.   Example 1: Classify and state the degree: 7 x 2 − 4 x 5 − 1 . Solution: Here there are three terms. The highest variable exponent is 5. Therefore, this is a trinomial of degree 5. Answer: Trinomial; degree 5   Example 2: Classify and state the degree: 12 a 5 b c 3 . Solution: Since the expression consists of only multiplication, it is one term, a monomial. The variable part can be written as a 5 b 1 c 3 ; hence its degree is 5 + 1 + 3 = 9 . Answer: Monomial; degree 9   Example 3: Classify and state the degree: 4 x 2 y − 6 x y 4 + 5 x 3 y 3 + 4 . Solution: The term 4 x 2 y has degree 3; − 6 x y 4 has degree 5; 5 x 3 y 3 has degree 6; and the constant term 4 has degree 0. Therefore, the polynomial has 4 terms with degree 6. Answer: Polynomial; degree 6   Of particular interest are polynomials with one variable A polynomial where each term has the form a n x n , where a n is any real number and n is any whole number. , where each term is of the form a n x n . Here a n is any real number and n is any whole number. Such polynomials have the standard form Typically, we arrange terms of polynomials in descending order based on the degree of each term. The leading coefficient The coefficient of the term with the largest degree. is the coefficient of the variable with the highest power, in this case, a n .   Example 4: Write in standard form: 3 x − 4 x 2 + 5 x 3 + 7 − 2 x 4 . Solution: Since terms are separated by addition, write the following: In this form, we can see that the subtraction in the original corresponds to negative coefficients. Because addition is commutative, we can write the terms in descending order based on the degree of each term as follows: Answer: − 2 x 4 + 5 x 3 − 4 x 2 + 3 x + 7   We can further classify polynomials with one variable by their degree as follows: Polynomial Name 5 Constant (degree 0) 2 x + 1 Linear (degree 1) 3 x 2 + 5 x − 3 Quadratic (degree 2) x 3 + x 2 + x + 1 Cubic (degree 3) 7 x 4 + 3 x 3 − 7 x + 8 Fourth-degree polynomial In this text, we call any polynomial of degree n ≥ 4 an nth-degree polynomial. In other words, if the degree is 4, we call the polynomial a fourth-degree polynomial. If the degree is 5, we call it a fifth-degree polynomial, and so on.  || Evaluating Polynomials Given the values for the variables in a polynomial, we can substitute and simplify using the order of operations.   Example 5: Evaluate: 3 x − 1 , where x = − 3 2 .

Aligning like terms in columns, as we have here, aids in the simplification process. Answer:   Notice that when multiplying a trinomial by a trinomial, we obtain nine terms before simplifying. In fact, when multiplying an n-term polynomial by an m-term polynomial, we will obtain n × m terms. In the previous example, we were asked to multiply and found that Because it is easy to make a small calculation error, it is a good practice to trace through the steps mentally to verify that the operations were performed correctly. Alternatively, we can check by evaluating We can be fairly certain that we have multiplied the polynomials correctly if we check that a few values evaluate to the same results in the original expression and in the answer. any value for x in both expressions to verify that the results are the same. Here we choose x = 2: Because the results could coincidentally be the same, a check by evaluating does not necessarily prove that we have multiplied correctly.

This rule applies when dividing a monomial by a monomial. In this section, we will assume that all variables in the denominator are nonzero.   Example 1: Divide: 28 y 3 7 y . Solution: Divide the coefficients and subtract the exponents of the variable y. Answer: 4 y 2   Example 2: Divide: 24 x 7 y 5 8 x 3 y 2 .

Answer: 3 x 4 y 3   When dividing a polynomial by a monomial, we may treat the monomial as a common denominator and break up the fraction using the following property: Applying this property results in terms that can be treated as quotients of monomials.   Example 3: Divide: − 5 x 4 + 25 x 3 − 15 x 2 5 x 2 . Solution: Break up the fraction by dividing each term in the numerator by the monomial in the denominator and then simplify each term. Answer: − x 2 + 5 x − 3   Check your division by multiplying the answer, the quotient The result after dividing. , by the monomial in the denominator, the divisor The denominator of a quotient. , to see if you obtain the original numerator, the dividend The numerator of a quotient. .   Example 4: Divide: 9 a 4 b − 7 a 3 b 2 + 3 a 2 b − 3 a 2 b . Solution: Answer: − 3 a 2 + 7 3 a b − 1 . The check is optional and is left to the reader.   Try this! Divide: ( 16 x 5 − 8 x 4 + 5 x 3 + 2 x 2 ) ÷ ( 2 x 2 ) . Answer: 8 x 3 − 4 x 2 + 5 2 x + 1 Video Solution  || Dividing by a Polynomial The same technique outlined for dividing by a monomial does not work for polynomials with two or more terms in the denominator. In this section, we will outline a process called polynomial long division The process of dividing two polynomials using the division algorithm. , which is based on the division algorithm for real numbers. For the sake of clarity, we will assume that all expressions in the denominator are nonzero.   Example 5: Divide: x 3 + 3 x 2 − 8 x − 4 x − 2 . Solution: Here x − 2 is the divisor and x 3 + 3 x 2 − 8 x − 4 is the dividend. Step 1: To determine the first term of the quotient, divide the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor. Step 2: Multiply the first term of the quotient by the divisor, remembering to distribute, and line up like terms with the dividend. Step 3: Subtract the resulting quantity from the dividend. Take care to subtract both terms. Step 4: Bring down the remaining terms and repeat the process from step 1. Notice that the leading term is eliminated and that the result has a degree that is one less than the dividend. The complete process is illustrated below: Polynomial long division ends when the degree of the remainder The expression that is left after the division algorithm ends. is less than the degree of the divisor. Here the remainder is 0. Therefore, the binomial divides the polynomial evenly and the answer is the quotient shown above the division line. To check the answer, multiply the divisor by the quotient to see if you obtain the dividend: Answer: x 2 + 5 x + 2   Next, we demonstrate the case where there is a nonzero remainder. Just as with real numbers, the final answer adds the fraction where the remainder is the numerator and the divisor is the denominator to the quotient. In general, when dividing we have If we multiply both sides by the divisor we obtain   Example 6: Divide: 6 x 2 − 5 x + 3 2 x − 1 . Solution: Since the denominator is a binomial, begin by setting up polynomial long division. To start, determine what monomial times 2 x − 1 results in a leading term 6 x 2 . This is the quotient of the given leading terms: ( 6 x 2 ) ÷ ( 2 x ) = 3 x . Multiply 3 x times the divisor 2 x − 1 and line up the result with like terms of the dividend. Subtract the result from the dividend and bring down the constant term +3. Subtracting eliminates the leading term and − 5 x − ( − 3 x ) = − 5 x + 3 x = − 2 x . The quotient of − 2 x and 2 x is −1. Multiply 2 x − 1 by −1 and line up the result. Subtract again and notice that we are left with a remainder. The constant term 2 has degree 0, and thus the division ends. We may write Answer: 3 x − 1 + 2 2 x − 1 . To check that this result is correct, we multiply as follows:   Occasionally, some of the powers of the variables appear to be missing within a polynomial. This can lead to errors when lining up like terms. Therefore, when first learning how to divide polynomials using long division, fill in the missing terms with zero coefficients, called placeholders Terms with zero coefficients used to fill in all missing exponents within a polynomial. .   Example 7: Divide: 27 x 3 + 64 3 x + 4 . Solution: Notice that the binomial in the numerator does not have terms with degree 2 or 1. The division is simplified if we rewrite the expression with placeholders: Set up polynomial long division: We begin with 27 x 3 ÷ 3 x = 9 x 2 and work the rest of the division algorithm. Answer: 9 x 2 − 12 x + 16   Example 8: Divide: 3 x 4 − 2 x 3 + 6 x 2 + 23 x − 7 x 2 − 2 x + 5 . Solution: Begin the process by dividing the leading terms to determine the leading term of the quotient 3 x 4 ÷ x 2 = 3 x 2 . Take care to distribute and line up the like terms. Continue the process until the remainder has a degree less than 2. The remainder is x − 2 . Write the answer with the remainder: Answer: 3 x 2 + 4 x − 1 + x − 2 x 2 − 2 x + 5   Polynomial long division takes time and practice to master. Work lots of problems and remember that you may check your answers by multiplying the quotient by the divisor (and adding the remainder if present) to obtain the dividend.   Try this! Divide: 20 x 4 − 32 x 3 + 7 x 2 + 8 x − 10   5 x − 3 . Answer: 4 x 3 − 4 x 2 − x + 1 − 7 5 x − 3 Video Solution  || Dividing Polynomial Functions We may use function notation to indicate division as follows: Division of functions: ( f / g ) ( x ) = f ( x ) g ( x ) The quotient of two polynomial functions does not necessarily have a domain of all real numbers. The values for x that make the function in the denominator 0 are restricted from the domain. This will be discussed in more detail at a later time. For now, assume all functions in the denominator are nonzero.   Example 9: Calculate: ( f / g ) ( x ) given f ( x ) = 6 x 5 − 36 x 4 + 12 x 3 − 6 x 2 and g ( x ) = − 6 x 2 . Solution: The notation indicates that we should divide: Answer: ( f / g ) ( x ) = − x 3 + 6 x 2 − 2 x + 1   Example 10: Calculate: ( f / g ) ( − 1 ) , given f ( x ) = − 3 x 3 + 7 x 2 − 11 x − 1 and g ( x ) = 3 x − 1 . Solution: First, determine ( f / g ) ( x ) . Therefore, Substitute −1 for the variable x . Answer: ( f / g ) ( − 1 ) = − 4  ||  || Negative Exponents In this section, we define what it means to have negative integer exponents. We begin with the following equivalent fractions: Notice that 4, 8, and 32 are all powers of 2. Hence we can write 4 = 2 2 , 8 = 2 3 , and 32 = 2 5 . If the exponent of the term in the denominator is larger than the exponent of the term in the numerator, then the application of the quotient rule for exponents results in a negative exponent. In this case, we have the following: We conclude that 2 − 3 = 1 2 3 . This is true in general and leads to the definition of negative exponents x − n = 1 x n , given any integer n, where x is nonzero. . Given any integer n and x ≠ 0 , then Here x ≠ 0 because 1 0 is undefined. For clarity, in this section, assume all variables are nonzero. Simplifying expressions with negative exponents requires that we rewrite the expression with positive exponents.   Example 1: Simplify: 10 − 2 . Solution: Answer: 1 100   Example 2: Simplify: ( − 3 ) − 1 . Solution: Answer: − 1 3   Example 3: Simplify: 1 y − 3 . Solution: Answer: y 3   At this point we highlight two very important examples, If the grouped quantity is raised to a negative exponent, then apply the definition and write the entire grouped quantity in the denominator. If there is no grouping, then apply the definition only to the base preceding the exponent.   Example 4: Simplify: ( 2 a b ) − 3 . Solution: First, apply the definition of −3 as an exponent and then apply the power of a product rule. Answer: 1 8 a 3 b 3   Example 5: Simplify: ( − 3 x y 3 ) − 2 . Solution: Answer: 1 9 x 2 y 6   Example 6: Simplify: x − 3 y − 4 . Solution: Answer: y 4 x 3   The previous example suggests a property of quotients with negative exponents x − n y − m = y m x n , given any integers m and n, where x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0 . . If given any integers m and n, where x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0 , then In other words, negative exponents in the numerator can be written as positive exponents in the denominator, and negative exponents in the denominator can be written as positive exponents in the numerator.   Example 7: Simplify: − 2 x − 5 y 3 z − 2 . Solution: Take care with the coefficient −2; recognize that this is the base and that the exponent is actually +1: − 2 = ( − 2 ) 1 . Hence the rules of negative exponents do not apply to this coefficient; leave it in the numerator. Answer: − 2 y 3 z 2 x 5   Example 8: Simplify: ( − 3 x − 4 ) − 3 y − 2 . Solution: Apply the power of a product rule before applying negative exponents. Answer: − x 12 y 2 27   Example 9: Simplify: ( 3 x 2 ) − 4 ( − 2 y − 1 z 3 ) − 2 . Solution: Answer: 4 z 6 81 x 8 y 2   Example 10: Simplify: ( 5 x 2 y ) 3 x − 5 y − 3 . Solution: First, apply the power of a product rule and then the quotient rule. Answer: 125 x 11 y 6   To summarize, we have the following rules for negative integer exponents with nonzero bases: Negative exponents: x − n = 1 x n Quotients with negative exponents: x − n y − m = y m x n   Try this! Simplify: ( − 5 x y − 3 ) − 2 5 x 4 y − 4 . Answer: y 10 125 x 6 Video Solution  || Scientific Notation Real numbers expressed in scientific notation Real numbers expressed in the form a × 10 n , where n is an integer and 1 ≤ a < 10 . have the form where n is an integer and 1 ≤ a < 10 . This form is particularly useful when the numbers are very large or very small. For example, It is cumbersome to write all the zeros in both of these cases. Scientific notation is an alternative, compact representation of these numbers. The factor 10 n indicates the power of 10 to multiply the coefficient by to convert back to decimal form: This is equivalent to moving the decimal in the coefficient fifteen places to the right. A negative exponent indicates that the number is very small: This is equivalent to moving the decimal in the coefficient eleven places to the left. Converting a decimal number to scientific notation involves moving the decimal as well. Consider all of the equivalent forms of 0.00563 with factors of 10 that follow: While all of these are equal, 5.63 × 10 − 3 is the only form considered to be expressed in scientific notation. This is because the coefficient 5.63 is between 1 and 10 as required by the definition. Notice that we can convert 5.63 × 10 − 3 back to decimal form, as a check, by moving the decimal to the left three places.   Example 11: Write 1,075,000,000,000 using scientific notation. Solution: Here we count twelve decimal places to the left of the decimal point to obtain the number 1.075. Answer: 1.075 × 10 12   Example 12: Write 0.000003045 using scientific notation. Solution: Here we count six decimal places to the right to obtain 3.045. Answer: 3.045 × 10 − 6   Often we will need to perform operations when using numbers in scientific notation. All the rules of exponents developed so far also apply to numbers in scientific notation.   Example 13: Multiply: ( 4.36 × 10 − 5 ) ( 5.3 × 10 12 ) . Solution: Use the fact that multiplication is commutative and apply the product rule for exponents. Answer: 2.3108 × 10 8   Example 14: Divide: ( 3.24 × 10 8 ) ÷ ( 9.0 × 10 − 3 ) . Solution: Answer: 3.6 × 10 10   Example 15: The speed of light is approximately 6.7 × 10 8 miles per hour. Express this speed in miles per second. Solution: A unit analysis indicates that we must divide the number by 3,600. Answer: The speed of light is approximately 1.9 × 10 5 miles per second.   Example 16: By what factor is the radius of the sun larger than the radius of earth? Solution: We want to find the number that when multiplied times the radius of earth equals the radius of the sun. Source: NASA and European Space Agency, from http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=188. Therefore, Answer: The radius of the sun is approximately 110 times that of earth.   Try this! Divide: ( 6.75 × 10 − 8 ) ÷ ( 9 × 10 − 17 ) . Answer: 7.5 × 10 8 Video Solution  ||
