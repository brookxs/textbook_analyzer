Factoring Method To solve quadratic equations by factoring, we must make use of the zero-factor property. Set the equation equal to zero, that is, get all the nonzero terms on one side of the equal sign and 0 on the other. a x 2 + b x + c = 0 Factor the quadratic expression. ( )( ) = 0 By the zero-factor property, at least one of the factors must be zero, so, set each of the factors equal to 0 and solve for the variable.
