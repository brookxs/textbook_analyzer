Parabolas We will now study the graphs of quadratic equations in two variables with general form Parabola All such graphs have a similar shape. The graph of a quadratic equation of this type Parabola is called a parabola and it will assume one of the following shapes. Vertex The high point or low point of a parabola is called the vertex of the parabola.
