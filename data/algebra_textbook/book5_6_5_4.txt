Nonlinear Equations Revisited Remember, if an equation is nonlinear, the first step is to make one side equal to zero by moving all terms to one side of the equation. Once you’ve completed this important first step, factor and apply the zero product property to find the solutions. You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Solve for x: 25x2 = 169 Solve for x: 16x2 = 121 Solution: Make one side equal to zero, factor, then apply the zero product property. 25x2 = 169 Original equation. 25x2 − 169 = 0 Subtract 169 from both sides. Note that we have two perfect squares separated by a minus sign. This is the difference of squares pattern. Take the square roots, making one term plus and one term minus. (5x+ 13)(5x− 13) = 0 Use difference of squares to factor. Use the zero product property to complete the solution, setting each factor equal to zero and solving the resulting equations. 5x+ 13 = 0 or 5x− 13 = 0 x = −13 5 x = 13 5 Hence, the solutions of 25x2 = 169 are x = −13/5 and x = 13/5. We encourage readers to check each of these solutions. Answer: −11/4, 11/4 ! 448 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING You Try It! EXAMPLE 12. Solve for x: 49x2 + 81 = 126xSolve for x: 25x2 = 80x− 64 Solution: Make one side equal to zero, factor, then apply the zero product property. One can also argue that the only number whose square is zero is the number zero. Hence, one can go directly from (7x− 9)2 = 0 to 7x− 9 = 0. Hence, the only solution of 49x2 + 81 = 126x is x = 9/7. 49x2 + 81 = 126x Original equation. 49x2 − 126x+ 81 = 0 Subtract 126x from both sides. Note that the first and last terms of the trinomial are perfect squares. Hence, it make sense to try and factor as a perfect square trinomial, taking the square roots of the first and last terms. (7x− 9)2 = 0 Factor as a perfect square trinomial. Of course, be sure to check the middle term. Because −2(7x)(9) = −126x, the middle term is correct. Because (7x − 9)2 = (7x − 9)(7x− 9), we can use the zero product property to set each factor equal to zero and solve the resulting equations. 7x− 9 = 0 or 7x− 9 = 0 x = 9 7 x = 9 7 Hence, the only solution of 49x2+81 = 126x is x = 9/7.

This is a four-term expression, so we try factoring by grouping. Factor x2 out of the first two terms, and −25 out of the second two terms. x2(2x+ 3)− 25(2x+ 3) = 0 Factor by grouping.

(x+ 5)(x− 5)(2x+ 3) = 0 Use difference of squares to factor. Finally, use the zero product property. Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x. x+ 5 = 0 or x− 5 = 0 or 2x+ 3 = 0 x = −5 x = 5 x = −3 2 Hence, the solutions of 2x3+3x2 = 50x+75 are x = −5, x = 5, and x = −3/2.

Make one side zero. x(x2 − 4) = 0 Factor out GCF. x(x + 2)(x− 2) = 0 Apply difference of squares. Note that we now have a product of three factors that equals zero. The zero product property says that at least one of these factors must equal zero. x = 0 or x+ 2 = 0 or x− 2 = 0 x = −2 x = 2 Hence, the solutions of x3 = 4x are x = 0, x = −2, and x = 2.
