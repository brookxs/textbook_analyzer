1.1 An Introduction to the Integers We begin with the set of counting numbers, formally called the set of natural numbers. The Natural Numbers. The set N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .} is called the set of natural numbers. If we add the number zero to the set of natural numbers, then we have a set of numbers that are called the whole numbers. The Whole Numbers. The set W = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .} is called the set of whole numbers. The number 0 is special, in that whenever you add it to another whole number, you get the identical number as an answer. Additive Identity Property. If a is any whole number, then a+ 0 = a. For this reason, the whole number 0 is called the additive identity. Thus, for example, 3 + 0 = 3, 15 + 0 = 15, and 123 + 0 = 123. These are all examples of the additive identity property. Every natural number has an opposite, so that when you add them together, their sum is zero. Additive Inverse Property. If a is any natural number, then define the opposite of a, symbolized by −a, so that a+ (−a) = 0. The number −a is called the “opposite of a,” or more formally, the additive inverse of a. For example, the opposite (additive inverse) of 3 is −3, and 3+ (−3) = 0. The opposite (additive inverse) of 12 is −12, and 12 + (−12) = 0. The opposite of 1.1. AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INTEGERS 3 254 is −254, and 254+(−254) = 0. These are all examples of additive inverses and the additive inverse property. Because 7+ (−7) = 0, we’ve said that −7 is the opposite (additive inverse) of 7. However, we can also turn that around and say that 7 is the opposite of −7. If we translate the phrase “the opposite of −7 is 7” into mathematical symbols, we get −(−7) = 7. The opposite of the opposite. Because a+ (−a) = 0, we can say that a is the opposite of −a. In symbols, we write: −(−a) = a Thus, for example, −(−11) = 11, −(−103) = 103, and −(−1255) = 1255. 1.1 An Introduction to the Integers We begin with the set of counting numbers, formally called the set of natural numbers.

The Integers. The set Z = {. . . ,−5,−4,−3,−2,−1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .} is called the set of integers. The integers can be made to correspond to points on a line in a very natural manner. First, draw a line, then locate the number zero anywhere you wish. Secondly, place the number one to the right of zero. This determines the length of one unit. Finally, locate the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . to the right of zero, then their opposites (additive inverses) −1, −2, −3, −4, −5, . . . to the left of zero (see Figure 1.1). −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Figure 1.1: Each integer corresponds to a unique position on the number line. Note that as we move to the right on the number line, the integers get larger. On the other hand, as we move to the left on the number line, the integers get smaller. Positive and negative integers. On the number line, some integers lie to the right of zero and some lie to the left of zero. 4 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS • If a is an integer that lies to the right of zero, then a is called a positive integer. • If a is an integer that lies to the left of zero, then a is called a negative integer. Thus, 4, 25, and 142 are positive integers, while−7, −53, and−435 are negative integers.  || Absolute Value The absolute value (or magnitude) of an integer is defined as follows. The Absolute Value of an Integer. If a is an integer, then the absolute value of a, written |a|, is defined as the distance between the integer and zero on the number line. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify |− 4|.Simplify: |− 23| Solution: Consider the position of −4 on the number line. Note that −4 lies four units away from zero. −7 −6 −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 units Because the absolute value (magnitude) of an integer equals its distance from zero, |− 4| = 4.Answer: |− 23| = 23 ! In similar fashion: • The integer 5 lies five units away from zero. Hence, |5| = 5. • The integer 0 lies zero units away from zero, Hence, |0| = 0. Note that the absolute value of any number is either positive or zero. That is, the absolute value of a number is nonnegative (not negative). 1.1.

For a more thorough introduction to integer addition, read section two of chapter two of our prealgebra textbook, provided online at the following URL: http://msenux.redwoods.edu/PreAlgText/contents/chapter2/ chapter2.pdf We consider the first of two cases. Adding Integers with Like Signs. To add two integers with like signs (both positive or both negative), add their magnitudes (absolute values), then prefix their common sign. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Simplify 7 + 12. Simplify: 13 + 28 Solution: We have like signs. The magnitudes (absolute values) of 7 and 12 are 7 and 12, respectively. If we add the magnitudes, we get 19. If we prefix the common sign, we get 19. That is: 7 + 12 = 19 Answer: 41 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify −8 + (−9). Simplify: −12 + (−21) Solution: We have like signs. The magnitudes (absolute values) of −8 and −9 are 8 and 9, respectively. If we add the magnitudes, we get 17. If we prefix the common sign, we get −17. That is: −8 + (−9) = −17 Answer: −33 ! Next, we consider the case where we have unlike signs. Adding Integers with Unlike Signs. To add two integers with unlike signs (one positive and one negative), subtract the integer with the smaller magnitude (absolute value) from the number with the larger magnitude, then prefix the sign of the integer with the larger magnitude. 6 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify −14 + 11.Simplify: 12 + (−29) Solution: We have unlike signs. The magnitudes (absolute values) of −14 and 11 are 14 and 11, respectively. If we subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger, we get 3. The number −14 has the larger magnitude, so we prefix our answer with its negative sign. That is: −14 + 11 = −3Answer: −17 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify 40 + (−25).Simplify: 32 + (−90) Solution: We have unlike signs. The magnitudes (absolute values) of 40 and −25 are 40 and 25, respectively. If we subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger, we get 15. The number 40 has the larger magnitude, so we prefix our answer with its positive sign. That is: 40 + (−25) = 15Answer: −58 !  || Mathematical Properties of Addition The order in which we add integers does not matter. That is, −20 + 34 gives an answer identical to the sum 34 + (−20). In both cases, the answer is 14. This fact is called the commutative property of addition. The Commutative Property of Addition. If a and b are any two integers, then: a+ b = b+ a Next, when we add three integers, it does not matter which two we add first. For example, if we add the second and third of three numbers first, we get: −11 + (−2 + 5) = −11 + 3 Parentheses first: −2 + 5 = 3 = −8 Add: −11 + 3 = −8 1.1. AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INTEGERS 7 On the other hand, if we add the first and second of three numbers first, we get: (−11 + (−2)) + 5 = −13 + 5 Parentheses first: −11 + (−2) = −13 = −8 Add: −13 + 5 = −8 Thus, −11 + (−2 + 5) = (−11 + (−2)) + 5. This fact is called the associative property of addition. The Associative Property of Addition. If a, b, and c are any three integers, then: a+ (b+ c) = (a+ b) + c  || Integer Subtraction Subtraction is the inverse, or the opposite, of addition. Subtracting Integers. If a and b are any two integers, then: a− b = a+ (−b) Subtracting b is identical to adding the opposite (additive inverse) of b. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Simplify: −13− 27 Simplify: −11− 15 Solution: The “opposite” (additive inverse) of 27 is −27. So, subtracting 27 is the same as adding −27. −13− 27 = −13 + (−27) Subtracting 27 is the same as adding −27. = −50 Add the magnitudes, then prefix the common negative sign. Answer: −26 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Simplify: −27− (−50) Simplify: −18− (−54) 8 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Solution: The “opposite” (additive inverse) of −50 is −(−50), or 50. So, subtracting −50 is the same as adding 50. −27− (−50) = −27 + 50 Subtracting −50 is the same as adding 50. = 23 Subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger magnitude, then prefix the sign of the larger magnitude.Answer: 36 !  || Integer Multiplication This section is designed to provide a quick review of multiplication and division of integers.

EXAMPLE 8. Simplify each of the following expressions:Simplify: (−18)(−5) (a) (2)(3) (b) (−12)(−8) (c) −14/(−2) Solution: When multiplying or dividing, like signs yield a positive result. (a) (2)(3) = 6 (b) (−12)(−8) = 96 (c) −14/(−2) = 7Answer: 90 ! Unlike Signs. If a and b are integers with unlike signs (one positive and one negative), then the product ab and the quotient a/b are negative. (+)(−) = − or (+)/(−) = − (−)(+) = − or (−)/(+) = − 1.1.

Simplify each of the following expressions: Simplify: (−19)(3) (a) (2)(−12) (b) (−9)(12) (c) 24/(−8) Solution: When multiplying or dividing, unlike signs yield a negative result. (a) (2)(−12) = −24 (b) (−9)(12) = −108 (c) 24/(−8) = −3 Answer: −57 !  || Mathematical Properties of Multiplication The order in which we multiply integers does not matter. That is, (−8)(5) gives an answer identical to (5)(−8). In both cases, the answer is −40. This fact is called the commutative property of multiplication. The Commutative Property of Multiplication. If a and b are any two integers, then: a · b = b · a Next, when we multiply three integers, it does not matter which two we multiply first. If we multiply the second and third of three numbers first, we get: (−3)[ (−4)(−5) ] = (−3)(20) Brackets first: (−4)(−5) = 20 = −60 Multiply: (−3)(20) = −60 On the other hand, if we multiply the first and second of three numbers first, we get:[ (−3)(−4) ](−5) = (12)(−5) Brackets first: (−3)(−4) = 12 = −60 Multiply: (12)(−5) = −60 Thus, (−3)[(−4)(−5)] = [(−3)(−4)](−5). This fact is called the associative property of multiplication. The Associative Property of Multiplication. If a, b, and c are any three integers, then: a · (b · c) = (a · b) · c When you multiply an integer by 1, you get the identical number back as the product. For example, (1)(5) = 5 and (−11)(1) = −11. This fact is known as the multiplicative identity property. 10 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS The Multiplicative Identity Property. If a is any integer, then: 1 · a = a and a · 1 = a For this reason, the integer 1 is called the “multiplicative identity.” Finally, note that (−1)(5) = −5. Thus, multiplying 5 by −1 is identical to taking the “opposite” of 5 or negating 5. The Multiplicative Property of −1. Multiplying by minus one is identical to negating. That is: (−1)a = −a  || Exponents In the exponential expression an, the number a is called the base, while the number n is called the exponent. We now define what is meant by an exponent. Exponents. Let a be an integer and let n be any whole number. If n != 0, then: an = a · a · a · · · · · a︸ ︷︷ ︸ n times That is, to calculate an, write a as a factor n times. You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Simplify (−2)3.Simplify: (−2)2 Solution: In the exponential expression (−2)3, note that −2 is the base, while 3 is the exponent. The exponent tells us to write the base as a factor three times. Simplify the result by performing the multiplications in order, moving from left to right. (−2)3 = (−2)(−2)(−2) −2 as a factor, three times. = (4)(−2) Multiply: (−2)(−2) = 4. = −8 Multiply: (4)(−2) = −8. Thus, (−2)3 = −8.Answer: 4 ! In Example 10, note that the product of three negative factors is negative. Let’s try another example. 1.1. AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INTEGERS 11 You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Simplify (−2)4. Simplify: (−2)5 Solution: In the exponential expression (−2)4, note that −2 is the base, while 4 is the exponent. The exponent tells us to write the base as a factor four times. Simplify the result by performing the multiplications in order, moving from left to right. (−2)4 = (−2)(−2)(−2)(−2) −2 as a factor, four times. = (4)(−2)(−2) Multiply: (−2)(−2) = 4. = (−8)(−2) Multiply: (4)(−2) = −8. = 16 Multiply: (−8)(−2) = 16. Thus, (−2)4 = 16. Answer: −32 ! In Example 11, note that the product of four negative factors is positive. Examples 10 and 11 reveal the following pattern. Odd or Even Exponents. 1. When a negative integer is raised to an even exponent, the result is positive. 2. When a negative integer is raised to an odd exponent, the result is neg- ative.  || Graphing Calculator: Negating versus Subtracting Consider the view of the lower half of the TI84 graphing calculator in Figure 1.2. Figure 1.2: Lower half of the TI-84. Note that there are two keys that contain some sort of negative sign, one on the bottom row of keys, and another in the last column of keys on the right, positioned just above the plus symbol. (-) and − The first of these buttons is the unary “negation” operator. If you want to negate a single (thus the word “unary”) number, then this is the key to use. For example, enter -3 by pressing the following button sequence. The result is shown in Figure 1.3. (-) 3 ENTER 12 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS The second button is the binary “subtraction” operator. If you want to subtract one number from another number (thus the word “binary”), then this is the key to use.
