Factoring Trinomials with Common Factors It is a good practice to first factor out the GCF, if there is one. Doing this produces a trinomial factor with smaller coefficients. As we have seen, trinomials with smaller coefficients require much less effort to factor. This commonly overlooked step is worth identifying early.   Example 6: Factor: 12 x 2 − 27 x + 6 . Solution: Begin by factoring out the GCF. After factoring out 3, the coefficients of the resulting trinomial are smaller and have fewer factors. After some thought, we can see that the combination that gives the coefficient of the middle term is 4 ( − 2 ) + 1 ( − 1 ) = − 8 − 1 = − 9 . Check. The factor 3 is part of the factored form of the original expression; be sure to include it in the answer. Answer: 3 ( 4 x − 1 ) ( x − 2 )   It is a good practice to consistently work with trinomials where the leading coefficient is positive.   Example 7: Factor: − x 2 + 2 x + 15 . Solution: In this example, the leading coefficient is −1. Before beginning the factoring process, factor out the −1: At this point, factor the remaining trinomial as usual, remembering to write the −1 as a factor in your final answer. Because 3 + (−5) = −2, use 3 and 5 as the factors of 15. Answer: − 1 ( x + 3 ) ( x − 5 ) . The check is left to the reader.   Example 8: Factor: − 60 a 2 − 5 a + 30 . Solution: The GCF of all the terms is 5. However, in this case factor out −5 because this produces a trinomial factor where the leading coefficient is positive. Focus on the factors of 12 and 6 that combine to give the middle coefficient, 1. After much thought, we find that 3 ⋅ 3 − 4 ⋅ 2 = 9 − 8 = 1 . Factor the remaining trinomial. Answer: − 5 ( 4 a + 3 ) ( 3 a − 2 ) . The check is left to the reader.   Try this! Factor: 24 + 2 x − x 2 .
