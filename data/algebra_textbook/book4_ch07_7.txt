 || Base, Percent, and Percentage There are three basic types of percent problems. Each type involves a base, a percent, and a percentage, and when they are translated from words to mathemati­cal symbols each becomes a multiplication statement. Examples of these types of problems are the following: What number is 30% of 50? (Missing product statement.) 15 is what percent of 50? (Missing factor statement.) 15 is 30% of what number? (Missing factor statement.) In problem 1, the product is missing. To solve the problem, we represent the missing product with P . P = 30% ⋅ 50 Percentage The missing product P is called the percentage. Percentage means part, or por­tion. In P = 30% ⋅50, P represents a particular part of 50. In problem 2, one of the factors is missing. Here we represent the missing factor with Q . 15 = Q ⋅ 50 Percent The missing factor is the percent. Percent, we know, means per 100, or part of 100. In 15 = Q ⋅50, Q indicates what part of 50 is being taken or considered. Specifi­cally, 15 = Q ⋅50 means that if 50 was to be divided into 100 equal parts, then Q indicates 15 are being considered. In problem 3, one of the factors is missing. Represent the missing factor with B . 15 = 30% ⋅ B Base The missing factor is the base. Some meanings of base are a source of supply, or a starting place. In 15 = 30% ⋅B , B indicates the amount of supply. Specifically, 15 = 30% ⋅B indicates that 15 represents 30% of the total supply. Each of these three types of problems is of the form ( percentage ) = ( percent ) ⋅ ( base ) We can determine any one of the three values given the other two using the methods discussed in Section 4.7.  || Finding the Percentage Sample Set A Example 7.36.  Thus, 15 is 30% of 50. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.1.. Example 7.37.  Thus, 34.2 is 36% of 95. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.1.. Example 7.38.  A salesperson, who gets a commission of 12% of each sale she makes, makes a sale of $8,400.00. How much is her commission? We need to determine what part of $8,400.00 is to be taken. What part indicates percentage. Thus, the salesperson's commission is $1,008.00. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.2.. Example 7.39.  A girl, by practicing typing on her home computer, has been able to increase her typing speed by 110%. If she originally typed 16 words per minute, by how many words per minute was she able to increase her speed? We need to determine what part of 16 has been taken. What part indicates percentage. Thus, the girl has increased her typing speed by 17.6 words per minute. Her new speed is 16 + 17.6 = 33.6 words per minute. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.3.. Example 7.40.  A student who makes $125 a month working part-time receives a 4% salary raise. What is the student's new monthly salary? With a 4% raise, this student will make 100% of the original salary + 4% of the original salary. This means the new salary will be 104% of the original salary. We need to determine what part of $125 is to be taken. What part indicates percentage. Thus, this student's new monthly salary is $130. Do the section called “Practice Set A”, Exercise 7.7.4.. Example 7.41.  An article of clothing is on sale at 15% off the marked price. If the marked price is $24.95, what is the sale price? Since the item is discounted 15%, the new price will be 100% – 15% = 85% of the marked price. We need to determine what part of 24.95 is to be taken. What part indicates percentage. Thus, the sale price of the item is $21.21. Practice Set A Exercise 7.7.1. (Go to Solution) What number is 42% of 85? Exercise 7.7.2. (Go to Solution) A sales person makes a commission of 16% on each sale he makes. How much is his commission if he makes a sale of $8,500? Exercise 7.7.3. (Go to Solution) An assembly line worker can assemble 14 parts of a product in one hour. If he can increase his assembly speed by 35%, by how many parts per hour would he increase his assembly of products? Exercise 7.7.4. (Go to Solution) A computer scientist in the Silicon Valley makes $42,000 annually. What would this scientist's new annual salary be if she were to receive an 8% raise?  || Finding the Percent Sample Set B Example 7.42.  Recall that (missing factor) = (product) ÷ (known factor). Thus, 15 is 30% of 50. Do the section called “Practice Set B”, Exercise 7.7.5.. Example 7.43.  Thus, 4.32 is 6% of 72. Do the section called “Practice Set B”, Exercise 7.7.5.. Example 7.44.  On a 160 question exam, a student got 125 correct answers. What percent is this? Round the result to two decimal places. We need to determine the percent. Thus, this student received a 78% on the exam. Do the section called “Practice Set B”, Exercise 7.7.6.. Example 7.45.  A bottle contains 80 milliliters of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and 30 milliliters of water. What percent of HCl does the bottle contain? Round the result to two decimal places. We need to determine the percent. The total amount of liquid in the bottle is 80 milliliters + 30 milliliters = 110 milliliters . Thus, this bottle contains approximately 73% HCl. Do the section called “Practice Set B”, Exercise 7.7.7.. Example 7.46.  Five years ago a woman had an annual income of $19,200. She presently earns $42,000 annually. By what percent has her salary increased? Round the result to two decimal places. We need to determine the percent. Thus, this woman's annual salary has increased 219%. Practice Set B Exercise 7.7.5. (Go to Solution) 99.13 is what percent of 431? Exercise 7.7.6. (Go to Solution) On an 80 question exam, a student got 72 correct answers. What percent did the student get on the exam? Exercise 7.7.7. (Go to Solution) A bottle contains 45 milliliters of sugar and 67 milliliters of water. What fraction of sugar does the bottle contain? Round the result to two decimal places (then express as a percent).  || Finding the Base Sample Set C Example 7.47.  Thus, 15 is 30% of 50. Try Exercise 7.7.8. in the section called “Practice Set C”. Example 7.48.  Thus, 56.43 is 33% of 171. Try Exercise 7.7.8. in the section called “Practice Set C”. Example 7.49.  Fifteen milliliters of water represents 2% of a hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution. How many milliliters of solution are there? We need to determine the total supply. The word supply indicates base. Thus, there are 750 milliliters of solution in the bottle. Try Exercise 7.7.9. in the section called “Practice Set C”. Example 7.50.  In a particular city, a sales tax of % is charged on items purchased in local stores. If the tax on an item is $2.99, what is the price of the item? We need to determine the price of the item. We can think of price as the starting place. Starting place indicates base. We need to determine the base. Thus, the price of the item is $46.00. Try Exercise 7.7.10. in the section called “Practice Set C”. Example 7.51.  A clothing item is priced at $20.40. This marked price includes a 15% discount. What is the original price? We need to determine the original price. We can think of the original price as the starting place. Starting place indicates base. We need to determine the base. The new price, $20.40, represents 100% – 15% = 85% of the original price. Thus, the original price of the item is $24.00. Try Exercise 7.7.11. in the section called “Practice Set C”. Practice Set C Exercise 7.7.8. (Go to Solution) 1.98 is 2% of what number? Exercise 7.7.9. (Go to Solution) 3.3 milliliters of HCl represents 25% of an HCl solution. How many milliliters of solution are there? Exercise 7.7.10. (Go to Solution) A salesman, who makes a commission of % on each sale, makes a commission of $152.39 on a particular sale. Rounded to the nearest dollar, what is the amount of the sale? Exercise 7.7.11. (Go to Solution) At "super-long play," hours of play of a video cassette recorder represents 31.25% of the total playing time. What is the total playing time?  ||
