The Number π The symbol π , read "pi," represents the nonterminating, nonrepeating decimal number 3.14159 … . This number has been computed to millions of decimal places without the appearance of a repeating block of digits. For computational purposes, π is often approximated as 3.14. We will write π ≈ 3.14 to denote that π is approximately equal to 3.14. The symbol "≈" means "approximately equal to."
