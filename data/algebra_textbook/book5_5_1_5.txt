Interchanging y and f(x) In most cases, y and f(x) are completely interchangeable. For example, com- pare and contrast the following two examples. 304 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Question: Given y = 3x + 7, find y when x equals 5. Solution: Replace x with 5. y = 3x+ 7 y = 3(5) + 7 y = 15 + 7 y = 22 Question: Given f(x) = 3x + 7, evaluate f(5). Solution: Replace x with 5. f(x) = 3x+ 7 f(5) = 3(5) + 7 f(5) = 15 + 7 f(5) = 22 In each case, the answer is 22. However, in the first case, the answer y = 22 disguises the fact that an x-value of 5 was used to arrive at the result. On the other hand, when we use function notation, the final answer f(5) = 22 indicates that we used an x-value of 5 to determine that the y-value is 22. This is another advantage of function notation. Let’s look at one final application demonstrating that y and f(x) are inter- changeable. You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Sketch the graph of f(x) = 2x− 3.Sketch the graph of f(x) = −2 3 x− 2. Solution: Because y and f(x) are interchangeable, the instruction is identical to “sketch the graph of y = 2x − 3.” The graph is a line, with slope 2 and y-intercept at (0,−3). Plot the y-intercept at (0,−3), then move up 2 and right 1 to create a line with slope 2 (see Figure 5.10). Note how we’ve labeled the graph with its equation using function notation. −5 5 −5 5 x y (0,−3) 2 1 f(x) = 2x− 3 Figure 5.10: The graph of f(x) = 2x− 3 is a line. Answer: −5 5 −5 5 x y (0,−2) −2 3 f(x) = −2 3 x− 2 ! 5.1. FUNCTIONS 305 ! ! ! Interchanging y and f(x) In most cases, y and f(x) are completely interchangeable.
