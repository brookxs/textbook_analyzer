Review Of Subtraction Of Polynomials A very important step in the process of dividing one polynomial by another is subtraction of polynomials. Let’s review the process of subtraction by observing a few examples. 1. Subtract x − 2 from x − 5; that is, find ( x − 5 ) − ( x − 2 ).  Since   x − 2 is preceded by a minus sign, remove the parentheses, change the sign of each term, then add. The result is − 3. 2. Subtract x 3 + 3x 2 from x 3 + 4x 2 + x − 1.  Since x 3 + 3x 2 is preceded by a minus sign, remove the parentheses, change the sign of each term, then add. The result is x2 + x − 1. 3. Subtract x 2 + 3x from x 2 + 1.  We can write x 2 + 1 as x 2 + 0x + 1.
