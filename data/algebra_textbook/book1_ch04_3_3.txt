Numerical Evaluation Numerical evaluation Numerical evaluation is the process of determining a value by substituting numbers for letters. Formulas In various areas (business, statistics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, sociology, psychology, etc.), particular equations occur quite frequently. Such equations are called formulas. Numerical evaluation is used frequently with formulas. Numerical Evaluation Numerical evaluation Numerical evaluation is the process of determining a value by substituting numbers for letters.
