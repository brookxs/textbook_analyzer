Factoring by Grouping The final factoring skill in this section involves four-term expressions. The technique for factoring a four-term expression is called factoring by grouping. You Try It! EXAMPLE 13. Factor by grouping: x2 + 8x+ 3x+ 24Factor by grouping: x2 − 6x+ 2x− 12 Solution: We “group” the first and second terms, noting that we can factor an x out of both of these terms. Then we “group” the third and fourth terms, noting that we can factor 3 out of both of these terms. x2 + 8x+ 3x+ 24 = x (x + 8) + 3 (x+ 8) Now we can factor x+ 8 out of both of these terms. = (x + 3)(x+ 8) Answer: (x+ 2)(x− 6) ! Let’s try a grouping that contains some negative signs. You Try It! EXAMPLE 14. Factor by grouping: x2 + 4x− 7x− 28Factor by grouping: x2 − 5x− 4x+ 20 Solution: We “group” the first and second terms, noting that we can factor x out of both of these terms. Then we “group” the third and fourth terms, then try to factor a 7 out of both these terms. x2 + 4x− 7x− 28 = x (x + 4) + 7 (−x− 4) This does not lead to a common factor. Let’s try again, this time factoring a −7 out of the third and fourth terms. x2 + 4x− 7x− 28 = x (x + 4)− 7 (x+ 4) That worked! We now factor out a common factor x+ 4. = (x − 7)(x+ 4) Answer: (x− 4)(x− 5) ! 6.1. THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR 395 Let’s increase the size of the numbers a bit. You Try It! EXAMPLE 15. Factor by grouping: 6x2 − 8x+ 9x− 12 Factor by grouping: 15x2 + 9x+ 10x+ 6 Solution: Note that we can factor 2x out of the first two terms and 3 out of the second two terms. 6x2 − 8x+ 9x− 12 = 2x (3x− 4) + 3 (3x− 4) Now we have a common factor 3x− 4 which we can factor out. = (2x+ 3)(3x− 4) Answer: (3x+ 2)(5x+ 3) ! As the numbers get larger and larger, you need to factor out the GCF from each grouping. If not, you won’t get a common factor to finish the factoring. You Try It! EXAMPLE 16. Factor by grouping: 24x2 − 32x− 45x+ 60 Factor by grouping: 36x2 − 84x+ 15x− 35 Solution: Suppose that we factor 8x out of the first two terms and −5 out of the second two terms. 24x2 − 32x− 45x+ 60 = 8x (3x− 4)− 5 (9x− 12) That did not work, as we don’t have a common factor to complete the factoring process. However, note that we can still factor out a 3 from 9x− 12. As we’ve already factored out a 5, and now we see can factor out an additional 3, this means that we should have factored out 3 times 5, or 15, to begin with. Let’s start again, only this time we’ll factor 15 out of the second two terms. 24x2 − 32x− 45x+ 60 = 8x (3x− 4)− 15 (3x− 4) Beautiful! We can now factor out 3x− 4. = (8x− 15)(3x− 4) Answer: (12x+ 5)(3x− 7) ! 396 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING ! ! ! Factoring by Grouping The final factoring skill in this section involves four-term expressions.
