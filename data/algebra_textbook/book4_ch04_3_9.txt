Converting Mixed Numbers to Improper Fractions To understand how to convert a mixed number to an improper fraction, we'll recall mixed number = (natural number) + (proper fraction) and consider the following diagram. Recall that multiplication describes repeated addition. Notice that can be obtained from using multiplication in the following way. Multiply: 3⋅1 = 3 Add: 3 + 2 = 5. Place the 5 over the 3: The procedure for converting a mixed number to an improper fraction is illustrated in this example. Converting a Mixed Number to an Improper Fraction To convert a mixed number to an improper fraction, Multiply the denominator of the fractional part of the mixed number by the whole number part. To this product, add the numerator of the fractional part. Place this result over the denominator of the fractional part. Sample Set B Convert each mixed number to an improper fraction. Example 4.16.  Multiply: 8⋅5 = 40. Add: 40 + 7 = 47. Place 47 over 8: . Thus, . Example 4.17.  Multiply: 3 ⋅ 16 = 48. Add: 48 + 2 = 50. Place 50 over 3: Thus, Practice Set B Convert each mixed number to its corresponding improper fraction. Exercise 4.3.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.3.8. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.3.9.
