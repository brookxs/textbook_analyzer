Solving algebraic equations containing polynomials is among the oldest problems in mathematics. The Babylonians solved quadratic equations as early as 2000 BC. Euclid of Alexandria used geometry to solve quadratic equations in 300 BC. Arab mathematicians solved quadratic equations in 1000 AD. The current method of solving equations using more modern notation started in 1557 when Robert Recorde used the equal sign in The Whetstone of Witte. In this chapter, we will learn about the properties of polynomials, as well as how to manipulate and use them in application problems. 293 294 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS  || 5.1 Functions We begin with the definition of a relation. Relation. A relation is a collection of ordered pairs. The collection of ordered pairs R = {(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6)} is an example of a relation. If we collect the first element of each ordered pair in a set, we have what is called the domain of the relation. Domain. The domain of a relation is the set of all first elements of the ordered pairs. For example, in the relation R = {(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6)}, if we collect the first element of each ordered pair in R, we get the domain: Domain of R = {0, 1, 2} Although the number zero appears twice as a first element in the ordered pairs of R, note that we list it only once when listing the elements in the domain of R. In similar fashion, if we collect the second elements of each ordered pair in a set, we have what is called the range of a relation. Range. The range of a relation is the set of all second elements of the ordered pairs. For example, in the relation R = {(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6)}, if we collect the second element of each ordered pair in R, we get the range: Range of R = {3, 4, 5, 6} You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. State the domain and range of the relationState the domain and range of the relation S = {(−1, 7), (2, 5), (2, 3)}. T = {(5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 4)}. Solution: Collect the first element of each ordered pair in T to list the domain: Domain of T = {5, 6, 7} 5.1. FUNCTIONS 295 Collect the second element of each ordered pair in T to list the range: Range of T = {3, 4} Note that even though the number three appears in the second position twice, Answer: Domain of S = {−1, 2}, Range of S = {3, 5, 7} we list it only once in describing the range. ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. State the domain and range of the relation shown in Figure 5.1. State the domain and range of the relation shown below. −5 5 −5 5 x y A B C D −5 5 −5 5 x y A B C D Figure 5.1: We can present a relation as a collection of ordered pairs in a graph. Solution: Point A has coordinates (3, 2), point B has coordinates (−2, 3), point C has coordinates (−4,−3), and point D has coordinates (1,−3). We can collect these points in a set. S = {(3, 2), (−2, 3), (−4,−3), (1,−3)} If we collect each element in the first position of each ordered pair, we have the domain. Domain of S = {−4,−2, 1, 3} Note that it is traditional to list the domain elements in order (smallest to largest). Next, if we collect each element in the second position of each ordered pair, we have the range. Range of S = {−3, 2, 3} 296 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Again, it is traditional to list the elements in order. Note again that weAnswer: Domain of S = {−2, 1, 2}, Range of S = {−4,−1, 2, 3} did not repeat the number −3 in listing the range, even though it is used twice as a second element of an ordered pair in the set S. !  || Mapping Diagrams A mapping diagram is a useful construction that helps one to analyze a relation. Consider the earlier relation R = {(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6)}, which had domain D = {0, 1, 2} and range R = {3, 4, 5, 6}. To construct a mapping diagram for R, list the elements in the domain of R on the left, list the elements of the range of R on the right, then use arrows to indicate the ordered pairs (see Figure 5.2). R 0 3 1 4 2 5 6 Figure 5.2: Using a mapping diagram to describe the relation R. Note how the ordred pair (0, 3) is indicated by drawing an arrow connecting 0 on the left to 3 on the right. We say that the relation “maps 0 to 3” and write R : 0 → 3. In similar fashion: • The ordered pair (0, 4) is indicated by drawing an arrow connecting 0 on the left to 4 on the right; i.e., R “maps 0 to 4” or R : 0 → 4. • The ordered pair (1, 5) is indicated by drawing an arrow connecting 1 on the left to 5 on the right; i.e., R “maps 1 to 5” or R : 1 → 5. • The ordered pair (2, 6) is indicated by drawing an arrow connecting 2 on the left to 6 on the right; i.e., R “maps 2 to 6” or R : 2 → 6. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Create a mapping diagram for the relation in Example 1. Solution. The relation of Example 1 is T = {(5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 4)}. List the domain D = {5, 6, 7} on the left, the range R = {3, 4} on the right, then use arrows to indicate the ordered pairs (see Figure 5.3). ! 5.1. FUNCTIONS 297 T 5 3 6 4 7 Figure 5.3: A mapping diagram for the relation T .  || Function Definition A function is a very special type of relation. Function A relation is a function if and only if each object in the domain is paired with exactly one object in the range. As a first example, consider the relation R = {(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6)} whose mapping diagram is pictured in Figure 5.2. Note that 0 in the domain is paired with two objects, 3 and 4, in the range. Hence, relation R is is not a function. As a second example, consider the relation T = {(5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 4)}, whose mapping diagram is pictured in Figure 5.3. In this example, each domain object is paired with exactly one range object: 5 only gets sent to 3, 6 only gets sent to 3, and 7 only gets sent to 4. Hence, the relation T is a function. The fact that the range object 3 is used twice does not matter. It’s the fact that each domain object gets sent to exactly one range object that matters. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Consider the relation pictured in Figure 5.4. Is it a function? Consider the relation pictured below. Is it a function? −5 5 −5 5 x y A B C D E −1 5 −1 5 x y A B C D E Figure 5.4: Is this relation a function? 298 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Solution: The graph in Figure 5.4 consists of the points A(1, 1), B(2, 2), C(3, 2), D(3, 3), and E(4, 4). The domain is D = {1, 2, 3, 4} and the range is R = {1, 2, 3, 4}. A mapping diagram (see Figure 5.5) will help us decide if the relation represented by the graph is a function. Put the domain on the left, the range on the right, then use arrows to indicate the ordered pairs. Let’s call the relation f . f 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 Figure 5.5: A mapping diagram for the relation f depicted in Figure 5.4. In Figure 5.5, note how the domain object 3 is “sent to” or paired with two range objects, 2 and 3. Hence, the relation f is not a function.Answer: Yes, the relation is a function. ! You Try It!

T = {(Bentley Mulsanne, 18), (Kia Soul, 30), (Lamborghini Gallardo, 20), (Smart Fortwo, 41), (Jaguar XF, 23)} Solution: In Figure 5.6, we create a mapping diagram indicating the relation between cars and their gas mileage. Note that each domain object on the left is paired with exactly one range object on the right. Hence, this relation is a function.

Note that the domain object “Robin” is paired with two range objects, “Connecticut” and “Michigan,” hence this relation is not a function. R Yellowhammer Alabama Robin Connecticut Nene Hawaii Michigan Figure 5.7: A mapping diagram for the relation R. Answer: No, the relation is not a function. !  || Mapping Diagram Notation The goal of this section is to introduce function notation. Let’s begin with the mapping diagram in Figure 5.8. f 1 2 2 4 3 6 4 8 Figure 5.8: Mapping diagram . The mapping diagram in Figure 5.8 reveals the following facts: • f maps 1 to 2 or f : 1→ 2. • f maps 2 to 4 or f : 2→ 4. 300 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS • f maps 3 to 6 or f : 3→ 6. • f maps 4 to 8 or f : 4→ 8. Note how the notation f : 4 → 8 correlates nicely with the mapping diagram in Figure 5.8. The notation f : 4 → 8 is read “f maps 4 to 8” or “f sends 4 to 8.” A closer look at the mapping diagram in Figure 5.8 reveals an interesting pattern. The “rule” seems to be that the relation f doubles each entry in its domain: twice 1 is 2, twice 2 is 4, twice 3 is 6, etc. It’s possible to give a general description of this “rule” by writing: f : x→ 2x (5.1) That is, f sends x to twice x, or equivalently, 2x. For example, we might ask “where does f send 15?” To answer this question, we would replace x with 15 in the rule (5.1) to get f : 15→ 2(15), or equivalently, f : 15→ 30. We could also ask “where does f send −7?” To answer this question, we would replace x with −7 in the rule (5.1) to get f : −7→ 2(−7), or equivalently, f : −7 → −14. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Given the rule f : x → 2x + 3, answer the question “whereGiven the rule f : x→ 3x− 5, answer the question “where does f send −2?” does f send 8?” Solution: To find where “f sends 8,” substitute 8 for x in the rule f : x → 2x+ 3 to get f : 8 → 2(8) + 3, or equivalently, f : 8 → 19. Answer: f : −2 → −11 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Given the rule f : x→ x/(x+3), answer the question “whereGiven the rule f : x→ 2x2 + 5x, answer the question “where does f send 3?” does f send −1?” 5.1. FUNCTIONS 301 Solution: To find where “f sends −1,” substitute −1 for x in the rule f : x→ x/(x+ 3) to get f : −1→ −1−1 + 3 or equivalently, f : −1→ −1 2 . Answer: f : 3 → 33 ! In Examples 7 and 8, note that each time you substitute a value for x in the given rule, you get a unique answer. This means that each object in the domain of f is sent to a unique object in the range of f , making the rules in Examples 7 and 8 functions. This leads us to an itemized description of a function. Rule of Three. A function consists of three parts: • a set of objects which mathematicians call the domain, • a second set of objects which mathematicians call the range, • and a rule that describes how to assign each object in the domain to exactly one object in the range.  || Function Notation Although the mapping diagram notation f : x→ 3− 4x is quite easy to understand, the standard function notation used is f(x) = 3− 4x. With mapping diagram notation, if we want to answer the question “where does f send 12?”, we write: f : x→ 3− 4x f : 12→ 3− 4(12) f : 12→ 3− 48 f : 12→ −45 Hence, f : 12 → −45; i.e., f sends 12 to −45. Function notation uses exactly the same concept; i.e, substitute 12 for x. 302 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Tips for Using Function Notation. 1. Replace all occurrences of variables in the notation with open parentheses. Leave room between the parentheses to substitute the given value of the variable. 2. Substitute the given values of variables in the open parentheses prepared in the first step. 3. Evaluate the resulting expression according to the Rules Guiding Order of Operations. Given f(x) = 3−4x, to evaluate f(12), first restate the function notation, then replace each occurrence of the variable with open parentheses. f(x) = 3− 4x Original function notation. f( ) = 3− 4( ) Replace each occurrence of x with open parentheses. Now substitute 12 for x in the open parentheses prepared in the last step. f(12) = 3− 4(12) Substitute 12 for x in the open parentheses positions. f(12) = 3− 48 Multiply. f(12) = −45 Subtract. Hence, f(12) = −45; i.e., f sends 12 to −45. You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Given f(x) = 4− 5x− x2, evaluate f(−3). Solution: Start by replacing each occurrence of the variable x with open parentheses. f(x) = 4− 5x− x2 Original function notation. f( ) = 4− 5( )− ( )2 Replace each occurrence of x with open parentheses. Figure 5.9: Calculator check. Now substitute −3 for x in the open parentheses prepared in the last step. f(−3) = 4− 5(−3)− (−3)2 Substitute −3 for x in the open parentheses positions. f(−3) = 4− 5(−3)− 9 Evaluate exponent: (−3)2 = 9. f(−3) = 4 + 15− 9 Multiply: −5(−3) = 15. f(−3) = 10 Simplify. Thus, f(−3) = 10. Check this on your calculator (see Figure 5.9). ! 5.1. FUNCTIONS 303 The next example demonstrates one of the advantages of function notation. For example, it is easy to refer to the function in which you want to substitute the given x-value. You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Given f(x) = 5 − x and g(x) = x2 − 9, find f(−1) and Given f(x) = 3x2 − 20 and g(x) = 4x+ 6/x, find f(−3) and g(2). g(−2). Solution: We’re given two function definitions, f and g, but we’re first asked to find f(−1). This means that we must replace each occurrence of x with −1 in the function f(x) = 5− x. f(x) = 5− x Original function notation. f( ) = 5− ( ) Replace each occurrence of x with open parentheses. Now substitute −1 for x in the open parentheses prepared in the last step. f(−1) = 5− (−1) Substitute −1 for x in the open parentheses position. = 5 + 1 Add the opposite. = 6 Simplify. Thus, f(−1) = 6. We’re next asked to find g(−2). This means that we must replace each occurrence of x with −2 in the function g(x) = x2 − 9. g(x) = x2 − 9 Original function notation. g( ) = ( )2 − 9 Replace each occurrence of x with open parentheses. Now substitute −2 for x in the open parentheses prepared in the last step. g(−2) = (−2)2 − 9 Substitute −2 for x in the open parentheses position. = 4− 9 Exponent first: (−2)2 = 4. = −5 Simplify. Thus, g(−2) = −5. Answer: f(−3) = 7 and g(2) = 10 !  || Interchanging y and f(x) In most cases, y and f(x) are completely interchangeable. For example, com- pare and contrast the following two examples. 304 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Question: Given y = 3x + 7, find y when x equals 5. Solution: Replace x with 5. y = 3x+ 7 y = 3(5) + 7 y = 15 + 7 y = 22 Question: Given f(x) = 3x + 7, evaluate f(5). Solution: Replace x with 5. f(x) = 3x+ 7 f(5) = 3(5) + 7 f(5) = 15 + 7 f(5) = 22 In each case, the answer is 22. However, in the first case, the answer y = 22 disguises the fact that an x-value of 5 was used to arrive at the result. On the other hand, when we use function notation, the final answer f(5) = 22 indicates that we used an x-value of 5 to determine that the y-value is 22. This is another advantage of function notation. Let’s look at one final application demonstrating that y and f(x) are inter- changeable. You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Sketch the graph of f(x) = 2x− 3.Sketch the graph of f(x) = −2 3 x− 2. Solution: Because y and f(x) are interchangeable, the instruction is identical to “sketch the graph of y = 2x − 3.” The graph is a line, with slope 2 and y-intercept at (0,−3). Plot the y-intercept at (0,−3), then move up 2 and right 1 to create a line with slope 2 (see Figure 5.10). Note how we’ve labeled the graph with its equation using function notation. −5 5 −5 5 x y (0,−3) 2 1 f(x) = 2x− 3 Figure 5.10: The graph of f(x) = 2x− 3 is a line. Answer: −5 5 −5 5 x y (0,−2) −2 3 f(x) = −2 3 x− 2 ! 5.1. FUNCTIONS 305 ! ! !  || 5.2 Polynomials We begin with the definition of a term. Term. A term is either a single number (called a constant term) or the product of a number and one or more variables. For example, each of the following is a term. −5 − 3x2 12y2z3 13a2bc3 Note how the first term is a single number, while the remaining terms are products of a number and one or more variables. For example, −3x2 is the product of −3, x, and x. Coefficient. When a term is a product of a number and one or more variables, the number is called the coefficient of the term. In the case of a term that is a single number, the number itself is called the coefficient. Thus, for example, the coefficients of the terms −5 − 3x2 12y2z3 13a2bc3 are −5, −3, 12, and 13, respectively. Degree. The degree of a term is the sum of the exponents on each variable of the term. A constant term (single number with no variables) has degree zero. Thus, for example, the degrees of the terms −5 − 3x2 12y2z3 13a2bc3 are 0, 2, 5, and 6, respectively. In the last example, note that 13a2bc3 is equivalent to 13a2b1c3, so adding exponents, we get: Degree of 13a2bc3 = Degree of 13a2b1c3 = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 Monomial. The words monomial and term are equivalent. Thus, −5 − 3x2 12y2z3 13a2bc3 are monomials. 5.2. POLYNOMIALS 309 Binomial. A binomial is a mathematical expression containing exactly two terms, separated by plus or minus signs. For example, each of the mathematical expressions 2x+ 3y − 3a2 − 3b2 xy + 7 − 3x2y + 5xy2 is a binomial. Each expression has exactly two terms. Trinomial. A trinomial is a mathematical expression containing exactly three terms, separated by plus or minus signs. For example, each of the mathematical expressions 2x2 + 3x+ 7 a2 + 2ab+ b2 x4 − 2x2y2 + 3y4 is a trinomial. Each expression has exactly three terms. A bicycle has two wheels, a binomial has two terms. A tricycle has three wheels, a trinomial has three terms. But once we get past three terms, the assignment of special names ceases and we use the generic word polynomial, which means “many terms.” Polynomial. A polynomial is a many-termed mathematical expression, with terms separated by plus or minus signs. The coefficients of a polynomial are the coefficients of its terms. Each of the previous expressions, 12y2z3 − 3a2 − 3b2 x4 − 2x2y2 + 3y4 though assigned the particular names monomial, binomial, and trinomial, re- spectively, are also “many-termed” expressions and can also be called polyno- mials. However, because the word polynomial means “many terms,” we can also use the word polynomial to describe mathematical expressions with more than three terms, such as: x4 − 4x3y + 6x2y2 − 4xy3 + y4 The coefficients of x4 − 4x3y + 6x2y2 − 4xy3 + y4 are 1, −4, 6, −4, and 1.  || Ascending and Descending Powers When asked to simplify a polynomial expression, we should combine any like terms we find, and when possible, arrange the answer in ascending or descend- ing powers. 310 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify the following polynomial expression, arranging yourSimplify the following polynomial, and arrange your answer in ascending powers of x: 3x2−5x3+8x+9x2−7x+2x3 answer in descending powers of x. Once you’ve completed that task, make a second arrangement, ordering your terms in ascending powers of x. 2x3 + 7x− 3x2 + 11x+ 8x2 + 11 + 15x Solution: In order to arrange our answer in descending powers of x, we want to place the term with the highest power of x first and the term with the lowest power of x last. We use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup, then we combine like terms. 2x3 + 7x− 3x2 + 11x+ 8x2 + 11 + 15x = 2x3 + (−3x2 + 8x2) + (7x+ 11x+ 15x) + 11 = 2x3 + 5x2 + 33x+ 11 Note how the powers of x start at 3, then go down in order. To arrange our final answer in ascending powers of x, we put the lowest power of x first, then the highest power of x last, regrouping and combining like terms. 2x3 + 7x− 3x2 + 11x+ 8x2 + 11 + 15x = 11 + (7x+ 11x+ 15x) + (−3x2 + 8x2) + 2x3 = 11 + 33x+ 5x2 + 2x3 Note how we start with the constant term, then the powers of x increase in order.Answer: x+ 12x2 − 3x3 ! When we have a polynomial in a single variable, such as the polynomial in Example 1, arranging the terms in ascending or descending order is fairly straightforward. However, a polynomial in two or more variables is a bit more difficult, and sometimes impossible, to arrange in a decent order. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Simplify the following polynomial expression, then arrangeSimplify the following polynomial, and arrange your answer in descending powers of x: −4x2y2 + 3xy3+ 6x3y − xy3 + 2x2y2 your answer in descending powers of x. x3 + 2xy2 − 6x2y + y3 − 3xy2 + 4x2y Solution: We’ll again use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup, putting the terms with the highest powers of x 5.2. POLYNOMIALS 311 first, then follow with terms containing lower powers of x in order. x3 + 2xy2 − 6x2y + y3 − 3xy2 + 4x2y = x3 + (−6x2y + 4x2y) + (2xy2 − 3xy2) + y3 = x3 − 2x2y − xy2 + y3 Note that this is a very natural order, the powers of x decrease while simulta- neously the powers of y increase. Answer: 6x3y − 2x2y2 + 2xy3 ! Not all examples will have nice ordering presented in Example 2, with the powers of one variable descending while the powers of the other variable simul- taneously ascends. Sometimes we have to make some very subjective choices on the ordering of terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify the following polynomial expression, then arrange Simplify the following polynomial, and arrange your answer in ascending powers of b: 5a3b2 + 4ab3 − 2a2b+ 3a3b2 − ab3 your answer in some sort of reasonable order. a3b3 + 2a2b− 3a2b3 + 4a3b3 + 5a4 + 3a2b+ b5 Solution: Let’s try to arrange the terms so that the powers of a descend. Again, we use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup. a3b3 + 2a2b− 3a2b3 + 4a3b3 + 5a4 + 3a2b+ b5 = 5a4 + (a3b3 + 4a3b3) + (2a2b + 3a2b)− 3a2b3 + b5 = 5a4 + 5a3b3 + 5a2b− 3a2b3 + b5 Note that in our final arrangement, the powers of a descend, but the powers of b bounce up and down, but at least we have the powers of a descending. That should help us spot if we’ve missed a term while simplifying the given problem. Answer: −2a2b+ 8a3b2 + 3ab3 !  || The Degree of a Polynomial To find the degree of a polynomial, locate the term of the polynomial having the highest degree. The degree of a polynomial. The degree of a polynomial is the degree of the term having the highest degree. 312 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Finding the degree of a polynomial of a single variable is pretty easy. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. What is the degree of the polynomial x3−4x2+5−6x+2x7?What is the degree of the polynomial 2x3 + 8x2 + 3x4 + 2x+ 10? Solution: First, let’s arrange the polynomial in descending powers of x. 2x7 + x3 − 4x2 − 6x+ 5 Arranging the polynomial in descending powers of x makes it easier to see that the term of the polynomial with the highest degree is 2x7. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is 7.Answer: 4 ! Finding the degree of a polynomial of more than one variable is a little bit trickier. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. What is the degree of the polynomial x4 − 2x3y7 + y5?What is the degree of the polynomial x2y4− 6x2y2 +5x2y5− 2xy? Solution: Note that the polynomial is already arranged in descending powers of x, an arrangement that is probably as good as we are going to get. In the following table, we list the degree of each term. Remember, the degree of any term is found by summing the exponents on its variables. Term Degree x4 4 −2x3y7 10 y5 5 Hence, the term with the highest degree is −2x3y7, making 10 the degree of the polynomial.Answer: 7 !  || Polynomial Functions First we define what we mean by a polynomial function. Polynomial function. A polynomial function is a function defined by a rule that assigns to each domain object a range object defined by a polynomial expression. 5.2. POLYNOMIALS 313 Advanced courses, such as multivariate calculus, frequently use polynomial functions of more than one variable such as f(x, y) = x2 + y2. However, in this course, our focus will be on polynomial functions of a single variable, such as p(x) = 3− 4x− 9x2 and q(x) = x3 − 9x2 + 11. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Given the polynomial function p(x) = x3− 8x− 11, evaluate Given the polynomial function p(x) = −3x2 + 7x+ 4, evaluate p(2). p(−3).

In Figure 5.13, the leading term of the parabola p(x) = −2x2− 8x− 6 has negative two as its coefficient, so it opens downward. The sign of the leading term of p(x) = ax2 + bx+ c determines whether the parabola opens up or down. • If a > 0, the parabola opens upward. • If a < 0, the parabola opens downward. The turning point of a parabola has a special name. The vertex of a parabola. The graph of the second degree polynomial p(x) = ax2+bx+c has a single turning point, called the vertex of the parabola.

EXAMPLE 8. Ginger runs a business selling wicker baskets. Her business The costs for producing and selling x widgets are given by the polynomial function C(x) = 50 + 5x− 0.5x2, and the revenue for selling x widgets is given by the polynomial function R(x) = 3.5x. Determine the profit if 75 widgets are sold. costs for producing and selling x wicker baskets are given by the polynomial function C(x) = 100+3x−0.02x2. The revenue she earns from selling x wicker baskets is given by the polynomial function R(x) = 2.75x. Find a formula for P (x), the profit made from selling x wicker baskets. Use your formula to determine Ginger’s profit if she sells 123 wicker baskets. Solution: The profit made from selling x wicker baskets is found by subtract- ing the costs incurred from the revenue received. In symbols: P (x) = R(x)− C(x) Next, replace R(x) and C(x) with their definitions. Because we are supposed to subtract all of the cost from the revenue, be sure to surround the cost polynomial with parentheses. P (x) = 2.75x− (100 + 3x− 0.02x2) Distribute the minus sign and combine like terms. = 2.75x− 100− 3x+ 0.02x2 = 0.02x2 − 0.25x− 100 Thus, the profit function is P (x) = 0.02x2 − 0.25x− 100. Next, to determine the profit if 123 wicker baskets are sold, substitute 123 for x in the profit function P (x). P (x) = 0.02x2 − 0.25x− 100 P (123) = 0.02(123)2 − 0.25(123)− 100 You can now use your graphing calculator to determine the profit (see Figure 5.34). Hence, the profit made from selling 123 wicker baskets is $171.83. Figure 5.34: Determining the profit from selling 123 wicker baskets. Answer: $2,650 ! 340 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS ! ! !  || 5.5 Laws of Exponents In Chapter 1, section 1, we first introduced the definition of an exponent. For convenience, we repeat that definition. In the exponential expression an, the number a is called the base, while the number n is called the exponent. Exponents. Let a be any real number and let n be any whole number. If n != 0, then: an = a · a · a · · · · · a︸ ︷︷ ︸ n times That is, to calculate an, write a as a factor n times. In the case where a != 0, but n = 0, then we define: a0 = 1 For example, raising a number to the fifth power requires that we repeat the number as a factor five times (see Figure 5.35). (−2)5 = (−2)(−2)(−2)(−2)(−2) = −32 Raising a number to the fourth power requires that we repeat that number as a factor four times (see Figure 5.35).( −1 2 )4 = ( −1 2 )( −1 2 )( −1 2 )( −1 2 ) = 1 16 As a final example, note that 100 = 1, but 00 is undefined (see Figure 5.36).

POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS  || Multiplying With Like Bases In the expression an, the number a is called the base and the number n isFor those who may be wondering why a0 = 1, provided a != 0, here is a nice argument. First, note that a1 = a, so: a · a0 = a1 · a0 On the right, repeat the base and add the exponents. a · a0 = a1 Or equivalently: a · a0 = a Now, divide both sides by a, which is permissable if a != 0. a · a0 a = a a Simplify both sides: a0 = 1 called the exponent. Frequently, we’ll be required to multiply two exponential expressions with like bases, such as x3 · x4. Recall that the exponent tells us how many times to write each base as a factor, so we can write: x3 · x4 = (x · x · x) · (x · x · x · x) = x · x · x · x · x · x · x = x7 Note that we are simply counting the number of times that x occurs as a factor. First, we have three x’s, then four x’s, for a total of seven x’s. However a little thought tells us that it is much quicker to simply add the exponents to reveal the total number of times x occurs as a factor. x3 · x4 = x3+4 = x7 The preceding discussion is an example of the following general law of expo- nents.

However, a much faster way to add “three twos” is to multiply: 3 · 2 = 6. Thus, when raising a “power to a second power,” repeat the base and multiply the exponents, as follows: (x2)3 = x2·3 = x6 The preceding discussion gives rise to the following third law of exponents. 348 CHAPTER 5.

Before we begin with the examples, let’s revisit the distributive property. We know that 2 · (3 + 4) = 2 · 3 + 2 · 4. Both sides are equal to 14. We’re used to having the monomial factor on the left, but it can also appear on the right. (3 + 4) · 2 = 3 · 2 + 4 · 2 Again, both sides equal 14.

Because (b+ c)a = ba+ ca, we will multiply x2 +2x+7 times both terms of x+ 5 in the following manner. (x+ 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x(x2 + 2x+ 7) + 5(x2 + 2x+ 7) Now we distribute monomials times polynomials, then combine like terms. = x3 + 2x2 + 7x+ 5x2 + 10x+ 35 = x3 + 7x2 + 17x+ 35 Thus, (x+ 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x3 + 7x2 + 17x+ 35.Answer: z3 +7z2 +21z+36 !  || Speeding Things Up a Bit Let’s rexamine Example 9 with the hope of unearthing a pattern that will allow multiplication of polynomials to proceed more quickly with less work.

Finally, combine like terms. (2y − 6)(3y2 + 4y + 11) = 6y3 + 8y2 + 22y − 18y2 − 24y − 66 = 6y3 − 10y2 − 2y − 66 Answer: 12x3 + 5x2 + 28x+ 20 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Use the shortcut technique to simplify (a+ b)2. Multiply: (3y − 2)2 Solution: To simplify (a+ b)2, we first must write a+ b as a factor two times. (a+ b)2 = (a+ b)(a+ b) Next, multiply a times both terms of a + b, multiply b times both terms of a+ b, then combine like terms. = a2 + ab+ ba+ b2 = a2 + 2ab+ b2 Note that ab = ba because multiplication is commutative, so ab+ ba = 2ab.

POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Solution: This time the first factor contains three terms, x2, x, and 1, so we first multiply x2 times each term of x2 − x− 1, then x times each term of x2 − x− 1, and 1 times each term of x2 − x− 1. Then we combine like terms. (x2 + x+ 1)(x2 − x− 1) = x4 − x3 − x2 + x3 − x2 − x+ x2 − x− 1 = x4 − x2 − 2x− 1 Answer: a4 − 4a2 + 12a− 9 !  || Some Applications Recall that the area of a circle of radius r is found using the formula A = pir2.

MULTIPLYING POLYNOMIALS 363 Solution: We can find the area of the shaded region by subtracting the area of the inner circle from the area of the outer circle. A = Area of outer circle−Area of inner circle We use the formula A = pir2 to compute the area of each circle. Because the outer circle has radius x+1, it has area pi(x+1)2. Because the inner circle has radius x, it has area pix2. = pi(x+ 1)2 − pix2 Next, we’ll expand (x+ 1)2, then combine like terms. = pi(x+ 1)(x+ 1)− pix2 = pi(x2 + x+ x+ 1)− pix2 = pi(x2 + 2x+ 1)− pix2 Finally, distribute pi times each term of x2 + 2x+ 1, then combine like terms. = pix2 + 2pix+ pi − pix2 = 2pix+ pi Hence, the area of the shaded region is A = 2pix+ pi.

The demand for widgets is a function of the unit price, Suppose that the demand for gadgets is given by the function x = 320− 1.5p, where x is the demand and p is the unit price. Use the graphing calculator to determine the unit price a retailer should charge for gadgets so that her revenue from sales equals $12,000. where the demand is the number of widgets the public will buy and the unit price is the amount charged for a single widget. Suppose that the demand is given by the function x = 270− 0.75p, where x is the demand and p is the unit price. Note how the demand decreases as the unit price goes up (makes sense). Use the graphing calculator to determine the unit price a retailer should charge for widgets so that his revenue from sales equals $20,000. Solution: To determine the revenue (R), you multiply the number of widgets sold (x) by the unit price (p). R = xp (5.5) However, we know that the number of units sold is the demand, given by the formula x = 270− 0.75p (5.6) Substitute equation 5.6 into equation 5.5 to obtain the revenue as a function of the unit price.

POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS ! ! !  || 5.7 Special Products This section is dedicated to explaining a number of important shortcuts for mul- tiplying binomials. These are extremely important patterns that will produce the same products computed in previous sections. It is essential that readers practice until they become proficient using each of the patterns presented in this section.  || The FOIL Method Consider the product of two binomials (x + 3)(x + 6). We already know how to find the product of these two binomials; we multiply x times both terms of x+ 6, then we multiply 3 times both terms of x+ 6. (x+ 3)(x+ 6) = x2 + 6x+ 3x+ 18 Normally we combine like terms, but we halt the process at this point so as to introduce the pattern called the FOIL method. The letters in the word FOIL stand for “First,” “Outer,” “Inner,” and “Last.” Let’s see how we can connect these terms to the product (x+3)(x+6). • The arrows indicate the terms in the “First” positions in each binomial. If you multiply the terms in the “First” position, you get x2. (x+ 3)(x+ 6) F • The arrows indicate the terms in the “Outer” positions in each binomial. If you multiply the terms in the “Outer” positions, you get 6x. (x+ 3)(x+ 6) O • The arrows indicate the terms in the “Inner” positions in each binomial. If you multiply the terms in the “Inner” positions, you get 3x. (x+ 3)(x+ 6) I • The arrows indicate the terms in the “Last” positions in each binomial. If you multiply the terms in the “Last” positions, you get 18. (x+ 3)(x+ 6) L 5.7. SPECIAL PRODUCTS 371 The following diagram shows the connection between “First,” “Outer,” “In- ner,” “Last,” and the answer. F O I L (x+ 3)(x+ 6) = x2 + 6x + 3x + 18 You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Use the FOIL method to simplify: (x+ 5)(x+ 7) Simplify: (x+ 2)(x+ 11) Solution: Multiply the “First” positions: x2. Multiply the “Outer” positions: 7x. Multiply the “Inner” positions: 5x. Multiply the “Last” positions: 35. F O I L (x+ 5)(x+ 7) = x2 + 7x + 5x + 35 Combining like terms, (x+ 5)(x+ 7) = x2 + 12x+ 35. Answer: x2 + 13x+ 22 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Use the FOIL method to simplify: (2x− 7)(x− 4) Simplify: (x− 1)(4x+ 5) Solution: Multiply the “First” positions: 2x2. Multiply the “Outer” posi- tions: −8x. Multiply the “Inner” positions: −7x. Multiply the “Last” posi- tions: 28. F O I L (2x− 7)(x− 4) = 2x2 − 8x − 7x + 28 Combining like terms, (2x− 7)(x− 4) = 2x2 − 15x+ 28. Answer: 4x2 + x− 5 ! At first glance, the FOIL method doesn’t look like much of a shortcut. After all, if we simply use the distributive property on the product of Example 2, we get the same quick result. (2x− 7)(x− 4) = 2x(x− 4)− 7(x− 4) = 2x2 − 8x− 7x+ 28 = 2x2 − 15x+ 28 The FOIL method becomes a true shortcut when we add the “Outer” and “Inner” results in our head. 372 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS FOIL Shortcut. To multiply two binomials, follow these steps: 1. Multiply the terms in the “First” positions. 2. Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and combine the results mentally (if they are like terms). 3. Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3.

Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and add the results mentally: 8y − 15y = −7y 3. Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions: −6 Write the answer with no intermediate steps: (4y− 3)(5y+2) = 20y2− 7y− 6. Answer: 14x2 − 17x− 6 ! 5.7. SPECIAL PRODUCTS 373  || The Difference of Squares We can use the FOIL shortcut to multiply (a+ b)(a− b). 1. Multiply the terms in the “First” positions: a2 2. Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and add the results mentally: ab− ab = 0 3. Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions: −b2 Thus, (a + b)(a − b) = a2 − b2. Note how the right-hand side a2 − b2 is the difference of two squares. This leads to the following shortcut. The difference of squares. If you have identical terms in the “First” po- sitions and identical terms in the “Last” positions, but one set is separated with a plus sign while the other is separated by a minus sign, then proceed as follows: 1. Square the “First” term. 2. Square the “Last” term. 3. Place a minus sign between the results That is, (a+ b)(a− b) = a2 − b2 Note: If you don’t have identical terms in the “First” and “Last” positions, with one set separated with a plus sign and the other with a minus sign, then you do not have the difference of squares pattern and you must find some other way to multiply. For example, (x+3)(x− 3) is an example of the difference of squares pattern, but (2y + 3)(2y − 5) is not. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Use the difference of squares shortcut to simplify: (x+3)(x− Simplify: (x+ 5)(x− 5) 3) Solution: Note how the terms in the “First” position are identical, as are the terms in the “Last” position, with one set separated by a plus sign and the other with a minus sign. Hence, this is the difference of squares pattern and we proceed as follows: 1. Square the term in the “First” position: x2 2. Square the term in the “Last” position: (−3)2 = 9 3. Separate the squares with a minus sign. 374 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS That is: (x+ 3)(x− 3) = x2 − (3)2 = x2 − 9 Note: You should practice this pattern until you can go straight from the problem statement to the answer without writing down any intermediate work, as in (x+ 3)(x− 3) = x2 − 9.Answer: x2 − 25 !

Hence, this is the difference of squares pattern and we proceed as follows: 1. Square the term in the “First” position: (8y)2 = 64y2 2. Square the term in the “Last” position: (7z)2 = 49z2 3. Separate the squares with a minus sign. That is: (8y + 7z)(8y − 7z) = (8y)2 − (7z)2 = 64y2 − 49z2 Note: You should practice this pattern until you can go straight from the problem statement to the answer without writing down any intermediate work, as in (8y + 7z)(8y − 7z) = 64y2 − 49z2.Answer: 9a2 − 36b2 !

Hence, this is the difference of squares pattern and we proceed as follows: 5.7. SPECIAL PRODUCTS 375 1. Square the term in the “First” position: (x3)2 = x6 2. Square the term in the “Last” position: (5y2)2 = 25y4 3. Separate the squares with a minus sign. That is: (x3 − 5y2)(x3 + 5y2) = (x3)2 − (5y2)2 = x6 − 25y4 Note: You should practice this pattern until you can go straight from the problem statement to the answer without writing down any intermediate work, as in (x3 − 5y2)(x3 + 5y2) = x6 − 25y4. Answer: 4y8 − z6 !  || Squaring a Binomial Before demonstrating the correct procedure for squaring a binomial, we will first share one of the most common mistakes made in algebra. Warning! This is incorrect! One of the most common mistakes made in algebra is the assumption that: (a+ b)2 = a2 + b2 The fact that this is incorrect is easily checked. Substitute 3 for a and 4 for b. (3 + 4)2 = 32 + 42 72 = 32 + 42 49 = 9 + 16 Clearly this is incorrect! So what is the correct answer? First, (a+ b)2 = (a+ b)(a+ b). We can now use the FOIL shortcut. 1. Multiply the terms in the “First” positions: a2 2. Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and add the results mentally: ab+ ab = 2ab 3. Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions: b2 Hence, the correct answer is (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2. This leads us to the following shortcut for squaring a binomial. 376 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Squaring a binomial. To square a binomial, such as (a + b)2, perform the following steps: 1. Square the “First” term: a2 2. Multiply the “First” and “Last” terms and double the result: 2ab 3. Square the “Last” term: b2 That is: (a+ b)2 = a2 + 2ab+ b2 You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Use the squaring a binomial shortcut to expand: (x+ 5)2Simplify: (x + 3)2 Solution: Follow these steps: 1. Square the first term: x2 2. Multiply the “First” and “Last” terms and double the result: 2(x)(5) = 10x 3. Square the “Last” term: 52 = 25 Thus: (x+ 5)2 = x2 + 2(x)(5) + (5)2 = x2 + 10x+ 25 Note: You should practice this pattern until you can go straight from the problem statement to the answer without writing down any intermediate work, as in (x+ 5)2 = x2 + 10x+ 25.Answer: x2 + 6x+ 9 ! Comment. Students often refuse to learn the “squaring a binomial” shortcut, noting that they can just as easily use the FOIL technique or a simple appli- cation of the distributive property to arrive at the same result. Unfortunately, failure to learn the “squaring a binomial” shortcut will severely handicap stu- dents, as this pattern is an important component of many procedures in future mathematics courses. You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Use the squaring a binomial shortcut to expand: (3x+ 7y)2Simplify: (2y + 3z)2 Solution: Follow these steps: 5.7. SPECIAL PRODUCTS 377 1. Square the first term: (3x)2 = 9x2 2. Multiply the “First” and “Last” terms and double the result: 2(3x)(7y) = 42xy 3. Square the “Last” term: (7y)2 = 49y2 Thus: (3x+ 7y)2 = (3x)2 + 2(3x)(7y) + (7y)2 = 9x2 + 42xy + 49y2 Note: You should practice this pattern until you can go straight from the problem statement to the answer without writing down any intermediate work, as in (3x+ 7y)2 = 9x2 + 42xy + 49y2. Answer: 4y2 + 12yz + 9z2 ! In the next example, when squaring a binomial with a minus sign, we take care of the minus sign by “adding the opposite.” You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Use the squaring a binomial shortcut to expand: (4a2−5b3)2 Simplify: (3x4 − 5z2)2 Solution: Add the opposite: (4a2−5b3)2 = (4a2+(−5b3))2. Now follow these steps: 1. Square the first term: (4a2)2 = 16a4 2. Multiply the “First” and “Last” terms and double the result: 2(4a2)(−5b3) = −40a2b3 3. Square the “Last” term: (−5b3)2 = 25b6 Thus: (4a2 − 5b3)2 = (4a2 + (−5b3))2 = (4a2)2 + 2(4a2)(−5b3) + (−5b3)2 = 16a4 − 40a2b3 + 25b6 Note: You should practice this pattern until you can go straight from the problem statement to the answer without writing down any intermediate work, as in (4a2 − 5b3)2 = 16a4 − 40a2b3 + 25b6. Answer: 9x8 − 30x4z2 + 25z4 ! Example 10 shows us that if we are squaring a difference, the middle term will be minus. That is, the only difference between (a+ b)2 and (a− b)2 is the sign of the middle term. 378 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Squaring a binomial. The shortcuts for squaring a binomial are: (a+ b)2 = a2 + 2ab+ b2 (a− b)2 = a2 − 2ab+ b2 You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Use the squaring a binomial shortcut to expand: (x3− y3)2Simplify: (a2 − 3b5)2 Solution: Use the pattern (a− b)2 = a2 − 2ab+ b2. Square the “First” term, multiply the “First” and “Last” terms and double the result, then square the “Last” term. Because of the minus sign, the middle term will be minus, but all other terms are plus. (x3 − y3)2 = (x3)2 − 2(x3)(y3) + (y3)2 = x6 − 2x3y3 + y6 Answer: a4 − 6a2b5 + 9b10 !  || An Application In Example 7 on page 348, we found the area of the outer square by summing the areas of its parts (see Figure 5.42).
