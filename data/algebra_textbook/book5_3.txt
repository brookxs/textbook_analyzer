3 Introduction to Graphing In thinking about solving algebra and geometry problems in the 1600’s, Rene Descartes came up with the idea of using algebraic procedures to help solve geometric problems and to also demonstrate algebraic operations by using ge- ometry. One of the easy ways to do this was to use the 2-dimensional geometric plane. He decided to use the letters near the end of the alphabet to name the axes: “x-axis” for the horizontal axis and “y-axis” for the vertical axis. Then ordered pairs (x, y) would be used to graph specific points on the plane and/or algebraic expressions and equations. Thus, the graphs on the following pages are done on a graph named a “Cartesian Coordinate” graph in Rene Descartes’ honor. The equation of a particular line can be written in several algebraic forms which you will learn to interpret. The geometric aspect of a line will be noted in its position and slope. We will also be focusing on geometric aspects such as parallel and perpendicular lines. Ultimately, these tasks will be used to help solve application problems involving speed and distance. In modern times, we use the graphing calculator to speed up the process of providing tables of data, graphing lines quickly, and finding solutions of equations. 151 152 CHAPTER 3.

INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING  || 3.1 Graphing Equations by Hand We begin with the definition of an ordered pair. Ordered Pair. The construct (x, y), where x and y are any real numbers, is called an ordered pair of real numbers. (4, 3), (−3, 4), (−2,−3), and (3,−1) are examples of ordered pairs. Order Matters. Pay particular attention to the phrase “ordered pairs.” Or- der matters. Consequently, the ordered pair (x, y) is not the same as the ordered pair (y, x), because the numbers are presented in a different order.  || The Cartesian Coordinate System Pictured in Figure 3.1 is a Cartesian Coordinate System. On a grid, we’veRene Descartes (1596-1650) was a French philosopher and mathematician who is well known for the famous phrase“cogito ergo sum” (I think, therefore I am), which appears in his Discours de la methode pour bien conduire sa raison, et chercher la verite dans les sciences (Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason, and Seeking Truth in the Sciences). In that same treatise, Descartes introduces his coordinate system, a method for representing points in the plane via pairs of real numbers. Indeed, the Cartesian plane of modern day is so named in honor of Rene Descartes, who some call the “Father of Modern Mathematics” created two real lines, one horizontal labeled x (we’ll refer to this one as the x-axis), and the other vertical labeled y (we’ll refer to this one as the y-axis). −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 1 2 3 4 5 −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 1 2 3 4 5 x y Figure 3.1: The Cartesian Coordinate System. Two Important Points: Here are two important points to be made about the horizontal and vertical axes in Figure 3.1. 3.1. GRAPHING EQUATIONS BY HAND 153 1. As you move from left to right along the horizontal axis (the x-axis in Figure 3.1), the numbers grow larger. The positive direction is to the right, the negative direction is to the left. 2. As you move from bottom to top along the vertical axis (the y-axis in Figure 3.1), the numbers grow larger. The positive direction is upward, the negative direction is downward. Additional Comments: Two additional comments are in order: 3. The point where the horizontal and vertical axes intersect in Figure 3.2 is called the origin of the coordinate system. The origin has coordinates (0, 0). 4. The horizontal and vertical axes divide the plane into four quadrants, numbered I, II, III, and IV (roman numerals for one, two, three, and four), as shown in Figure 3.2. Note that the quadrants are numbered in a counter-clockwise order. −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 1 2 3 4 5 −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 1 2 3 4 5 x y III III IV Origin: (0, 0) Figure 3.2: Numbering the quadrants and indicating the coordinates of the origin. 154 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING  || Plotting Ordered Pairs Before we can plot any points or draw any graphs, we first need to set up a Cartesian Coordinate System on a sheet of graph paper? How do we do this? What is required? Draw and label each axis. If we are going to plot points (x, y), then, on aWe don’t always label the horizontal axis as the x-axis and the vertical axis as the y-axis. For example, if we want to plot the velocity of an object as a function of time, then we would be plotting points (t, v). In that case, we would label the horizontal axis as the t-axis and the vertical axis as the v-axis. sheet of graph paper, perform each of the following initial tasks. 1. Use a ruler to draw the horizontal and vertical axes. 2. Label the horizontal axis as the x-axis and the vertical axis as the y-axis. The result of this first step is shown in Figure 3.3. Indicate the scale on each axis. 3. Label at least one vertical gridline with its numerical value. 4. Label at least one horizontal gridline with its numerical value. An example is shown in Figure 3.4. Note that the scale indicated on the x-axisThe scales on the horizontal and vertical axes may differ. However, on each axis, the scale must remain consistent. That is, as you count to the right from the origin on the x-axis, if each gridline represents one unit, then as you count to the left from the origin on the x-axis, each gridline must also represent one unit. Similar comments are in order for the y-axis, where the scale must also be consistent, whether you are counting up or down. indicates that each gridline counts as 1-unit as we count from left-to-right. The scale on the y-axis indicates that each gridlines counts as 2-units as we count from bottom-to-top. x y Figure 3.3: Draw and label each axis. −5 5 −10 10 x y Figure 3.4: Indicate the scale on each axis. 3.1. GRAPHING EQUATIONS BY HAND 155 Now that we know how to set up a Cartesian Coordinate System on a sheet of graph paper, here are two examples of how we plot points on our coordinate system. To plot the ordered pair (4, 3), start at the origin and move 4 units to the right along the horizontal axis, then 3 units upward in the direction of the vertical axis. −5 5 −5 5 x y 4 3 (4, 3) To plot the ordered pair (−2,−3), start at the origin and move 2 units to the left along the horizontal axis, then 3 units downward in the direc- tion of the vertical axis. −5 5 −5 5 x y −2 −3 (−2,−3) Continuing in this manner, each ordered pair (x, y) of real numbers is asso- ciated with a unique point in the Cartesian plane. Vice-versa, each point in the Cartesian point is associated with a unique ordered pair of real numbers. Because of this association, we begin to use the words “point” and “ordered pair” as equivalent expressions, sometimes referring to the “point” (x, y) and other times to the “ordered pair” (x, y). You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Identify the coordinates of the point P in Figure 3.5. Identify the coordinates of the point P in the graph below. −5 5 −5 5 x y P Solution: In Figure 3.6, start at the origin, move 3 units to the left and 4 units up to reach the point P . This indicates that the coordinates of the point P are (−3, 4). 156 CHAPTER 3.

Answer: (3,−2) !  || Equations in Two Variables The equation y = x + 1 is an equation in two variables, in this case x and y.The variables do not have to always be x and y. For example, the equation v = 2+ 3.2t is an equation in two variables, v and t. Consider the point (x, y) = (2, 3). If we substitute 2 for x and 3 for y in the equation y = x+ 1, we get the following result: y = x+ 1 Original equation. 3 = 2 + 1 Substitute: 2 for x, 3 for y. 3 = 3 Simplify both sides. Because the last line is a true statement, we say that (2, 3) is a solution of the equation y = x + 1. Alternately, we say that (2, 3) satisfies the equation y = x+ 1. On the other hand, consider the point (x, y) = (−3, 1). If we substitute −3 for x and 1 for y in the equation y = x+ 1, we get the following result. y = x+ 1 Original equation. 1 = −3 + 1 Substitute: −3 for x, 1 for y. 1 = −2 Simplify both sides. Because the last line is a false statement, the point (−3, 1) is not a solution of the equation y = x+1; that is, the point (−3, 1) does not satisfy the equation y = x+ 1. 3.1. GRAPHING EQUATIONS BY HAND 157 Solutions of an equation in two variables. Given an equation in the variables x and y and a point (x, y) = (a, b), if upon subsituting a for x and b for y a true statement results, then the point (x, y) = (a, b) is said to be a solution of the given equation. Alternately, we say that the point (x, y) = (a, b) satisfies the given equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Which of the ordered pairs (0,−3) and (1, 1) satisfy the Which of the ordered pairs (−1, 3) and (2, 1) satisfy the equation y = 2x+ 5? equation y = 3x− 2? Solution: Substituting the ordered pairs (0,−3) and (1, 1) into the equation y = 3x− 2 lead to the following results: Consider (x, y) = (0,−3). Substitute 0 for x and −3 for y: y = 3x− 2 −3 = 3(0)− 2 −3 = −2 The resulting statement is false. Consider (x, y) = (1, 1). Substitute 1 for x and 1 for y: y = 3x− 2 1 = 3(1)− 2 1 = 1 The resulting statement is true. Thus, the ordered pair (0,−3) does not satisfy the equation y = 3x− 2, but the ordered pair (1, 1) does satisfy the equation y = 3x− 2. Answer: (−1, 3) !  || Graphing Equations in Two Variables Let’s first define what is meant by the graph of an equation in two variables. The graph of an equation. The graph of an equation is the set of all points that satisfy the given equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Sketch the graph of the equation y = x+ 1. Sketch the graph of the equation y = −x+ 2. Solution: The definition requires that we plot all points in the Cartesian Coordinate System that satisfy the equation y = x + 1. Let’s first create a table of points that satisfy the equation. Start by creating three columns with headers x, y, and (x, y), then select some values for x and put them in the first column. 158 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING Take the first value of x, namely x = −3, and substitute it into the equation y = x+ 1. y = x+ 1 y = −3 + 1 y = −2 Thus, when x = −3, we have y = −2. Enter this value into the table. x y = x+ 1 (x, y) −3 −2 (−3,−2) −2 −1 0 1 2 3 Continue substituting each tabular value of x into the equation y = x+ 1 and use each result to complete the corresponding entries in the table. x y = x+ 1 (x, y) y = −3 + 1 = −2 −3 −2 (−3,−2) y = −2 + 1 = −1 −2 −1 (−2,−1) y = −1 + 1 = 0 −1 0 (−1, 0) y = 0 + 1 = 1 0 1 (0, 1) y = 1 + 1 = 2 1 2 (1, 2) y = 2 + 1 = 3 2 3 (2, 3) y = 3 + 1 = 4 3 4 (3, 4) The last column of the table now contains seven points that satisfy the equation y = x+1. Plot these points on a Cartesian Coordinate System (see Figure 3.7). −5 5 −5 5 x y Figure 3.7: Seven points that sat- isfy the equation y = x+ 1. −5 5 −5 5 x y Figure 3.8: Adding additional points to the graph of y = x+ 1. In Figure 3.7, we have plotted seven points that satisfy the given equation y = x+ 1. However, the definition requires that we plot all points that satisfy the equation. It appears that a pattern is developing in Figure 3.7, but let’s calculate and plot a few more points in order to be sure. Add the x-values 3.1. GRAPHING EQUATIONS BY HAND 159 −2.5, −1.5, −0.5, 05, 1.5, and 2.5 to the x-column of the table, then use the equation y = x+ 1 to evaluate y at each one of these x-values. x y = x+ 1 (x, y) y = −2.5 + 1 = −1.5 −2.5 −1.5 (−2.5,−1.5) y = −1.5 + 1 = −0.5 −1.5 −0.5 (−1.5,−0.5) y = −0.5 + 1 = 0.5 −0.5 0.5 (−0.5, 0.5) y = 0.5 + 1 = 1.5 0.5 1.5 (0.5, 1.5) y = 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 1.5 2.5 (1.5, 2.5) y = 2.5 + 1 = 3.5 2.5 3.5 (2.5, 3.5) Add these additional points to the graph in Figure 3.7 to produce the image shown in Figure 3.8. There are an infinite number of points that satisfy the equation y = x+ 1. In Figure 3.8, we’ve plotted only 13 points that satisfy the equation. However, the collection of points plotted in Figure 3.8 suggest that if we were to plot the remainder of the points that satisfy the equation y = x + 1, we would get the graph of the line shown in Figure 3.9. −5 5 −5 5 x y y = x+ 1 Figure 3.9: The graph of y = x+ 1 is a line. Answer: −5 5 −5 5 x yy = −x+ 2 !  || Guidelines and Requirements Example 3 suggests that we should use the following guidelines when sketching the graph of an equation. 160 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING Guidelines for drawing the graph of an equation. When asked to draw the graph of an equation, perform each of the following steps: 1. Set up and calculate a table of points that satisfy the given equation. 2. Set up a Cartesian Coordinate System on graph paper and plot the points in your table on the system. Label each axis (usually x and y) and indicate the scale on each axis. 3. If the number of points plotted are enough to envision what the shape of the final curve will be, then draw the remaining points that satisfy the equation as imagined. Use a ruler if you believe the graph is a line. If the graph appears to be a curve, freehand the graph without the use of a ruler. 4. If the number of plotted points do not provide enough evidence to en- vision the final shape of the graph, add more points to your table, plot them, and try again to envision the final shape of the graph. If you still cannot predict the eventual shape of the graph, keep adding points to your table and plotting them until you are convinced of the final shape of the graph. Here are some additional requirements that must be followed when sketch- ing the graph of an equation. Graph paper, lines, curves, and rulers. The following are requirements for this class: 5. All graphs are to be drawn on graph paper. 6. All lines are to be drawn with a ruler. This includes the horizontal and vertical axes. 7. If the graph of an equation is a curve instead of a line, then the graph should be drawn freehand, without the aid of a ruler.  || Using the TABLE Feature of the Graphing Calculator As the equations become more complicated, it can become quite tedious to create tables of points that satisfy the equation. Fortunately, the graphing calculator has a TABLE feature that enables you to easily construct tables of points that satisfy the given equation. 3.1. GRAPHING EQUATIONS BY HAND 161 You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Use the graphing calculator to help create a table of points that satisfy the equation y = x2−7. Plot the points in your table. If you don’t feel that there is enough evidence to envision what the final shape of the graph will be, use the calculator to add more points to your table and plot them. Continue this process until your are convinced of the final shape of the graph. Figure 3.10: The graphing calculator.

Each time you select 6:ZStandard from the ZOOMmenu, Xmin is set to −10, Xmax to 10, and Xscl to 1 (distance between the tick marks on the x-axis). Similarly, Ymin is set to −10, Ymax to 10, and Yscl to 1 (distance between the tick marks on the y-axis). You can, however, override these settings as we shall see in the next example. You Try It!

Sketch the graphs of the following equations on the sameApproximate the point of intersection of the graphs of y = x− 4 and y = 5− x using the TRACE button. viewing screen. y = 5 4 x− 3 and y = 2 3 x+ 4 Adjust the viewing window so that the point at which the graphs intersect (where the graphs cross one another) is visible in the viewing window, then use the TRACE button to approximate the coordinates of the point of intersection. Solution: We must first decide on the proper syntax to use when entering the equations. In the case of the first equation, note that y = 5 4 x− 3 is pronounced “y equals five-fourths x minus three,” and means “y equals five- fourths times x minus three.” Enter this equation into Y1 in the Y= menu as 5/4*X−3 (see Figure 3.33), using the button keystrokes: 5 ÷ 4 × X,T, θ, n − 3 The division and times buttons are located in the rightmost column of the calculuator. Similarly, enter the second equation into Y2 as 2/3*X+4 using the button keystrokes: 2 ÷ 3 × X,T, θ, n + 4 Select 6:ZStandard in the ZOOM menu to produce the lines in Figure 3.34. When we examine the resulting graphs in Figure 3.34, it appears that their point of intersection will occur off the screen above and to the right of the upper right-corner of the current viewing window. With this thought in mind, let’s extend the x-axis to the right by increasing the value of Xmax to 20. Further, let’s extend the y-axis upward by increasing the value of Ymin to 20. Press the WINDOW button on the top row of the calculator, then make the adjustments shown in Figure 3.35. 3.2. THE GRAPHING CALCULATOR 177 Figure 3.33: Enter equations. Figure 3.34: The graphs.

If we select 6:ZStandard from the ZOOM menu, our changes to the WIN- DOW parameters will be discarded and the viewing window will be returned to the “standard viewing window.” If we want to keep our changes to the WIN- DOW parameters, the correct approach at this point is to push the GRAPH button on the top row of the calculator. The resulting graph is shown in Figure 3.36. Note that the point of intersection of the two lines is now visible in the viewing window. The image in Figure 3.36 is ready for recording onto your homework. How- ever, we think we would have a better picture if we made a couple more changes: 1. It would be nicer if the point of intersection were more centered in the viewing window. 2. There are far too many tick marks. With these thoughts in mind, make the changes to the WINDOW parame- ters shown in Figure 3.37, then push the GRAPH button to produce the image in Figure 3.38. 178 CHAPTER 3.

THE GRAPHING CALCULATOR 179 ! ! !  || 3.3 Rates and Slope Let’s open this section with an application of the concept of rate. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. An object is dropped from rest, then begins to pick up speed Starting from rest, an automobile picks up speed at a constant rate of 5 miles per hour every second (5 (mi/hr)/s). Sketch the graph of the speed of the object versus time. at a constant rate of 10 meters per second every second (10 (m/s)/s or 10m/s2). Sketch the graph of the speed of the object versus time. Solution: In this example, the speed of the object depends on the time. This makes the speed the dependent variable and time the independent variable. Independent versus dependent. It is traditional to place the independent variable on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable on the vertical axis. Following this guideline, we place the time on the horizontal axis and the speed on the vertical axis. In Figure 3.41, note that we’ve labeled each axis with the dependent and independent variables (v and t), and we’ve included the units (m/s and s) in our labels. Next, we need to scale each axis. In determining a scale for each axis, keep two thoughts in mind: 1. Pick a scale that makes it convenient to plot the given data. 2. Pick a scale that allows all of the given data to fit on the graph. In this example, we want a scale that makes it convenient to show that the speed is increasing at a rate of 10 meters per second (10 m/s) every second (s). One possible approach is to make each tick mark on the horizontal axis equal to 1 s and each tick mark on the vertical axis equal to 10 m/s. t(s) v(m/s) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Figure 3.41: Label and scale each axis.

INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING Next, at time t = 0 s, the speed is v = 0 m/s. This is the point (t, v) = (0, 0) plotted in Figure 3.42. Secondly, the rate at which the speed is increasing is 10 m/s per second. This means that every time you move 1 second to the right, the speed increases by 10 m/s. In Figure 3.42, start at (0, 0), then move 1 s to the right and 10 m/s up. This places you at the point (1, 10), which says that after 1 second, the speed of the particle is 10 m/s. Continue in this manner, continuously moving 1 s to the right and 10 m/s upward. This produces the sequence of points shown in Figure 3.42. Note that this constant rate of 10 (m/s)/s forces the graph of the speed versus time to be a line, as depicted in Figure 3.43. t(s) v(m/s) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Figure 3.43: The constant rate forces the graph to be a line.

For example, suppose that the temperature in the morning is 40◦ F, then in the afternoon the temperature measures 60◦ F (F stands for Fahrenheit temperature). Then the change in temperature is found by taking a difference. Change in temperature = Afternoon temperature−Morning temperature = 60◦ F− 40◦ F = 20◦ F Therefore, there was a twenty degree increase in temperature from morning to afternoon. 3.3. RATES AND SLOPE 185 Now, suppose that the evening temperature measures 50◦ F. To calculate the change in temperature from the afternoon to the evening, we again subtract. Change in temperature = Evening temperature−Afternoon temperature = 50◦ F− 60◦ F = −10◦F There was a ten degree decrease in temperature from afternoon to evening. Calculating the Change in a Quantity. To calculate the change in a quantity, subtract the earlier measurement from the later measurement. Let T represent the temperature. Mathematicians like to use the symbolism ∆T to represent the change in temperature. For the change in temperature from morning to afternoon, we would write ∆T = 20◦ F. For the afternoon to evening change, we would write ∆T = −10◦ F. Mathematicians and scientists make frequent use of the Greek alphabet, the first few letters of which are: α,β, γ, δ, . . . (Greek alphabet, lower case) A,B,Γ,∆, . . . (Greek alphabet, upper case) a, b, c, d, . . . (English alphabet) Thus, the Greek letter ∆, the upper case form of δ, correlates with the letter ‘d’ in the English alphabet. Why did mathematicians make this choice of letter to represent the change in a quantity? Because to find the change in a quantity, we take a difference, and the word “difference” starts with the letter ‘d.’ Thus, ∆T is also pronounced “the difference in T .” Important Pronunciations. Two ways to pronounce the symbolism ∆T . 1. ∆T is pronounced “the change in T .” 2. ∆T is also pronounced “the difference in T .”  || Slope as Rate Here is the definition of the slope of a line. Slope. The slope of a line is the rate at which the dependent variable is chang- ing with respect to the independent variable. For example, if the dependent 186 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING variable is y and the independent variable is x, then the slope of the line is: Slope = ∆y ∆x You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. In Example 1, an object released from rest saw that its speedStarting from rest, an automobile picks up speed at a constant rate of 5 miles per hour every second (5 (mi/hr)/s). The constant rate forces the graph of the speed of the object versus time to be a line. Calculate the slope of this line. increased at a constant rate of 10 meters per second per second (10 (m/s)/s or 10m/s2). This constant rate forced the graph of the speed versus time to be a line, shown in Figure 3.43. Calculate the slope of this line. Solution: Start by selecting two points P (2, 20) and Q(8, 80) on the line, as shown in Figure 3.44. To find the slope of this line, the definition requires that we find the rate at which the dependent variable v changes with respect to the independent variable t. That is, the slope is the change in v divided by the change in t. In symbols: Slope = ∆v ∆t t(s) v(m/s) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 P (2, 20) Q(8, 80) Figure 3.44: Pick two points to compute the slope. t(s) v(m/s) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 P (3, 30) Q(7, 70) Figure 3.45: The slope does not de- pend on the points we select on the line. Now, as we move from point P (2, 20) to point Q(8, 80), the speed changes from 20 m/s to 80 m/s. Thus, the change in the speed is: ∆v = 80m/s− 20m/s = 60m/s 3.3. RATES AND SLOPE 187 Similarly, as we move from point P (2, 20) to point Q(8, 80), the time changes from 2 seconds to 8 seconds. Thus, the change in time is: ∆t = 8 s− 2 s = 6 s Now that we have both the change in the dependent and independent variables, we can calculate the slope. Slope = ∆v ∆t = 60m/s 6 s = 10 m/s s Therefore, the slope of the line is 10 meters per second per second (10 (m/s)/s or 10m/s2). The slope of a line does not depend upon the points you select. Let’s try the slope calculation again, using two different points and a more compact presentation of the required calculations. Pick points P (3, 30) and Q(7, 70) as shown in Figure 3.45. Using these two new points, the slope is the rate at which the dependent variable v changes with respect to the independent variable t. Slope = ∆v ∆t = 70m/s− 30m/s 7 s− 3 s = 40m/s 4 s = 10 m/s s Again, the slope of the line is 10 (m/s)/s. Answer: 5 (mi/hr)/s ! Example 2 points out the following fact. Slope is independent of the selected points. It does not matter which two points you pick on the line to calculate its slope. The next example demonstrates that the slope is also independent of the order of subtraction. 188 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Compute the slope of the line passing through the pointsCompute the slope of the line passing through the points P (−3, 1) and Q(2, 4). P (−1,−2) and Q(3, 3). Solution: First, sketch the line passing through the points P (−1,−2) and Q(3, 3) (see Figure 3.46). −5 5 −5 5 x y P (−1,−2) Q(3, 3) Figure 3.46: Computing the slope of the line passing through the points P (−1,−2) and Q(3, 3). To calculate the slope of the line through the points P (−1,−2) and Q(3, 3), we must calculate the change in both the independent and dependent variables. We’ll do this in two different ways. Warning! If you are not consistent in the direction you subtract, you will not get the correct answer for the slope. For example: 3− (−2) −1− 3 = − 5 4 In this case, we subtracted the y-coordinate of point P (−1,−2) from the y-coordinate of point Q(3, 3), but then we changed horses in midstream, subtracting the x-coordinate of point Q(3, 3) from the x-coordinate of point P (−1,−2). Note that we get the negative of the correct answer. Subtract the coordinates of point P (−1,−2) from the coordinates of point Q(3, 3). Slope = ∆y ∆x = 3− (−2) 3− (−1) = 5 4 Subtract the coordinates of point Q(3, 3) from the coordinates of point P (−1,−2). Slope = ∆y ∆x = −2− 3 −1− 3 = −5 −4 = 5 4 Note that regardless of the direction of subtraction, the slope is 5/4.Answer: 3/5 ! 3.3. RATES AND SLOPE 189 Example 3 demonstrates the following fact. The direction of subtraction does not matter. When calculating the slope of a line through two points P and Q, it does not matter which way you subtract, provided you remain consistent in your choice of direction.  || The Steepness of a Line We need to examine whether our definition of slope matches certain expecta- tions. Slope and steepness of a line. The slope of a line is a number that tells us how steep the line is. If slope is a number that measures the steepness of a line, then one would expect that a steeper line would have a larger slope. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Graph two lines, the first passing through the points P (−3,−2) Compute the slope of the line passing through the points P (−2,−3) and Q(2, 5). Then compute the slope of the line passing through the points R(−2,−1) and S(5, 3), and compare the two slopes. Which line is steeper? and Q(3, 2) and the second through the points R(−1,−3) and S(1, 3). Calcu- late the slope of each line and compare the results. Solution: The graphs of the two lines through the given points are shown, the first in Figure 3.47 and the second in Figure 3.48. Note that the line in Figure 3.47 is less steep than the line in Figure 3.48. −5 5 −5 5 x y P (−3,−2) Q(3, 2) Figure 3.47: This line is less steep than the line on the right. −5 5 −5 5 x y R(−1,−3) S(1, 3) Figure 3.48: This line is steeper than the line on the left. Remember, the slope of the line is the rate at which the dependent variable is changing with respect to the independent variable. In both Figure 3.47 and Figure 3.48, the dependent variable is y and the independent variable is x. 190 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING Subtract the coordinates of point P (−3,−2) from the coordinates of point Q(3, 2). Slope of first line = ∆y ∆x = 2− (−2) 3− (−3) = 4 6 = 2 3 Subtract the coordinates of the point R(−1,−3) from the point S(1, 3). Slope of second line = ∆y ∆x = 3− (−3) 1− (−1) = 6 2 = 3 Note that both lines go uphill and both have positive slopes. Also, note that the slope of the second line is greater than the slope of the first line. This is consistent with the fact that the second line is steeper than the first. Answer: The first line has slope 2, and the second line has slope 4/7. The first line is steeper. ! In Example 4, both lines slanted uphill and both had positive slopes, the steeper of the two lines having the larger slope. Let’s now look at two lines that slant downhill. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Graph two lines, the first passing through the points P (−3, 1)Compute the slope of the line passing through the points P (−3, 3) and Q(3,−5). Then compute the slope of the line passing through the points R(−4, 1) and S(4,−3), and compare the two slopes. Which line is steeper? and Q(3,−1) and the second through the points R(−2, 4) and S(2,−4). Cal- culate the slope of each line and compare the results. Solution: The graphs of the two lines through the given points are shown, the first in Figure 3.49 and the second in Figure 3.50. Note that the line in Figure 3.49 goes downhill less quickly than the line in Figure 3.50. Remember, the slope of the line is the rate at which the dependent variable is changing with respect to the independent variable. In both Figure 3.49 and Figure 3.50, the dependent variable is y and the independent variable is x. Subtract the coordinates of point P (−3, 1) from the coordinates of point Q(3,−1).

Note that both lines go downhill and both have negative slopes. Also, note that the magnitude (absolute value) of the slope of the second line is greater than the magnitude of the slope of the first line. This is consistent with the fact that the second line moves downhill more quickly than the first. Answer: The first line has slope −4/3, and the second line has slope −1/2. The first line is steeper. ! What about the slopes of vertical and horizontal lines? You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Calculate the slopes of the vertical and horizontal lines Calculate the slopes of the vertical and horizontal lines passing through the point (−4, 1). passing through the point (2, 3). Solution: First draw a sketch of the vertical and horizontal lines passing through the point (2, 3). Next, select a second point on each line as shown in Figures 3.51 and 3.52. −5 5 −5 5 x y Q(2, 3)P (−2, 3) Figure 3.51: A horizontal line through (2, 3). −5 5 −5 5 x y S(2, 3) R(2,−3) Figure 3.52: A vertical line through (2, 3). 192 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING The slopes of the horizontal and vertical lines are calculated as follows. Subtract the coordinates of the point P (−2, 3) from the coordi- nates of the point Q(2, 3). Slope of horizontal line = ∆y ∆x = 3− 3 2− (−2) = 0 4 = 0 Thus, the slope of the horizontal line is zero, which makes sense be- cause a horizontal line neither goes uphill nor downhill. Subtract the coordinates of the point (2,−3) from the coordinates of the point S(2, 3). Slope of vertical line = ∆y ∆x = 3− (−3) 2− 2 = 6 0 = undefined Division by zero is undefined. Hence, the slope of a vertical line is undefined. Again, this makes sense because as uphill lines get steeper and steeper, their slopes increase without bound. Answer: The slope of the vertical line is undefined. The slope of the second line is 0. !  || The Geometry of the Slope of a Line We begin our geometrical discussion of the slope of a line with an example, calculating the slope of a line passing through the points P (2, 3) and Q(8, 8). Before we begin we’ll first calculate the change in y and the change in x by sub- tracting the coordinates of point P (2, 3) from the coordinates of point Q(8, 8). Slope = ∆y ∆x = 8− 3 8− 2 = 5 6 Thus, the slope of the line through the points P (2, 3) and Q(8, 8) is 5/6. To use a geometric approach to finding the slope of the line, first draw the line through the points P (2, 3) and Q(8, 8) (see Figure 3.53). Next, draw a right triangle with sides parallel to the horizontal and vertical axes, using the points P (2, 3) and Q(8, 8) as vertices. As you move from point P to point R in Figure 3.53, note that the change in x is ∆x = 6 (count the tick marks1). 1When counting tick marks, make sure you know the amount each tick mark represents. For example, if each tick mark represents two units, and you count six tick marks when evaluating the change in x, then ∆x = 12. 3.3. RATES AND SLOPE 193 As you then move from point R to point Q, the change in y is ∆y = 5 (count the tick marks). Thus, the slope is ∆y/∆x = 5/6, precisely what we got in the previous computation. −1 10 10 −1 x y ∆x = 6 ∆y = 5 P (2, 3) Q(8, 8) R(8, 3) Figure 3.53: Determining the slope of the line from the graph. −1 10 10 −1 x y ∆y = 5 ∆x = 6 P (2, 3) Q(8, 8) R(3, 8) Figure 3.54: Determining the slope of the line from the graph. For contrast, in Figure 3.54, we started at the point P (2, 3), then moved upward Rise over run. In Figure 3.54, we start at the point P (2, 3), then “rise” 5 units, then “run” 6 units to the right. For this reason, some like to think of the slope as “rise over run.” 5 units and right 6 units. However, the change in y is still ∆y = 5 and the change in x is still ∆x = 6 as we move from point P (2, 3) to point Q(8, 8). Hence, the slope is still ∆y/∆x = 5/6. Consider a second example shown in Figure 3.55. Note that the line slants downhill, so we expect the slope to be a negative number. −1 10 10 −1 x y ∆y = −4 ∆x = 6 P (2, 7) Q(8, 3) R(2, 3) Figure 3.55: Determining the slope of the line from the graph. −1 10 10 −1 x y ∆x = 6 ∆y = −4 P (2, 7) Q(8, 3) R(8, 7) Figure 3.56: Determining the slope of the line from the graph.

As you move from point P to point R in Figure 3.55, the change in y is ∆y = −4 194 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING (count the tick marks and note that your values of y are decreasing as you move from P to R). As you move from point R to point Q, the change is x is ∆x = 6 (count the tick marks and note that your values of x are increasing as you move from R to Q). Thus, the slope is ∆y/∆x = −4/6, or −2/3. Note that the slope is negative, as anticipated. In Figure 3.56, we’ve drawn our triangle on the opposite side of the line. In this case, as you move from point P to point R in Figure 3.56, the change in x is ∆x = 6 (count the tick marks and note that your values of x are increasing as you move from P to R). As you move from point R to point Q, the change is y is ∆y = −4 (count the tick marks and note that your values of y are decreasing as you move from R to Q). Thus, the slope is still ∆y/∆x = −4/6, or −2/3. We can verify our geometrical calculations of the slope by subtracting the coordinates of the point P (2, 7) from the point Q(8, 3). Slope = ∆y ∆x = 3− 7 8− 2 = −4 6 = −2 3 This agrees with the calculations made in Figures 3.55 and 3.56. Let’s look at a final example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Sketch the line passing through the point (−2, 3) with slopeSketch the line passing through the point (−4, 2) with slope −1/4. −2/3. Solution: The slope is −2/3, so the line must go downhill. In Figure 3.57, we start at the point P (−2, 3), move right 3 units to the point R(1, 3), then move down 2 units to the point Q(1, 1). Draw the line through the points P and Q and you are done. In Figure 3.58, we take a different approach that results in the same line. Start at the point P ′(−2, 3), move downward 4 units to the point R′(−2,−1), then right 6 units to the point Q′(4,−1). Draw a line through the points P ′ and Q′ and you are done. The triangle &PQR in Figure 3.57 is similar to the triangle &P ′Q′R′ in Figure 3.58, so their sides are proportional. Consequently, the slope of the line through points P ′(−2, 3) and Q′(4,−1), Slope = ∆y ∆x = −4 6 = −2 3 3.3.

Answer: −5 5 −5 5 x y P (−4, 2) Q(0, 1) ! A summary of facts about the slope of a line. We present a summary of facts learned in this section. 1. The slope of a line is the rate at which the dependent variable is changing with respect to the independent variable. If y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable, then the slope is Slope = ∆y ∆x , where ∆y is the change in y (difference in y) and ∆x is the change in x (difference in x). 2. If a line has positive slope, then the line slants uphill as you “sweep your eyes from left to right.” If two lines have positive slope, then the line with the larger slope rises more quickly. 3. If a line has negative slope, then the line slants downhill as you “sweep your eyes from left to right.” If two lines have negative slope, then the line having the slope with the larger magnitude falls more quickly. 4. Horizontal lines have slope zero. 5. Vertical lines have undefined slope. 196 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING ! ! !  || 3.4 Slope-Intercept Form of a Line We start with the definition of the y-intercept of a line. The y-intercept. The point (0, b) where the graph of a line crosses the y-axis is called the y-intercept of the line. We will now generate the slope-intercept formula for a line having y-intercept (0, b) and Slope = m (see Figure 3.59). Let (x, y) be an arbitrary point on the line. x y (0, b) (x, y) Slope = m Figure 3.59: Line with y-intercept at (0, b) and Slope = m. Start with the fact that the slope of the line is the rate at which the dependent variable is changing with respect to the independent variable. Slope = ∆y ∆x Slope formula. Substitute m for the slope. To determine both the change in y and the change in x, subtract the coordinates of the point (0, b) from the point (x, y). m = y − b x− 0 Substitute m for the Slope.∆y = y − b and ∆x = x− 0. m = y − b x Simplify. Clear fractions from the equation by multiplying both sides by the common denominator. mx = [ y − b x ] x Multiply both sides by x. mx = y − b Cancel. 202 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING Solve for y. mx+ b = y − b + b Add b to both sides. mx+ b = y Simplify. Thus, the equation of the line is y = mx+ b. The Slope-Intercept form of a line. The equation of the line having y- intercept (0, b) and slope m is: y = mx+ b Because this form of a line depends on knowing the slope m and the intercept (0, b), this form is called the slope-intercept form of a line.

Solution: Compare the equation y = 35x + 1 with the slope-intercept form y = mx + b, and note that m = 3/5 and b = 1. This means that the slope is 3/5 and the y-intercept is (0, 1). Start by plotting the y-intercept (0, 1), then move uward 3 units and right 5 units, arriving at the point (5, 4).

When we compare the calculator produced graph in Figure 3.61 to the hand drawn graph in Figure 3.60, they look a bit different. This difference is due to the fact that the calculator’s viewing window is wider than it is tall. On the other hand, the grid in Figure 3.60 is perfectly square. Hence, it appears that the lines increase at different angles. The graphing calculator has a feature that will cure this distortion.

Label the line with the slope-intercept form of its equation. the line with the slope-intercept form of its equation. Solution: Plot the y-intercept (0, 2). Now use the slope −7/3. Start at (0, 2), then move down seven units, followed by a three unit move to the right to the point (3,−5). Draw the line through the points (0, 2) and (3,−5). (see Figure 3.64). Next, the y-intercept is (0, 2), so b = 2. Further, the slope is −7/3, so m = −7/3. Substitute these numbers into the slope-intercept form of the line. y = mx+ b Slope-intercept form. y = −7 3 x+ 2 Substitute: −7/3 for m, 2 for b.

We could also subtract the coordinates of point (0,−1) from the coordinates of point (5, 6) to determine the slope. 6− (−1) 5− 0 = 7 5 Next, we try to locate a point on the line that passes directly through a lattice point, a point where a vertical and horizontal grid line intersect. In Figure 3.67, we chose the point (5, 6). Now, starting at the y-intercept (0, 1), we move up 7 units, then to the right 5 units. Hence, the slope is m = ∆y/∆x, or m = 7/5. −10 10 −10 10 x y ∆y = 7 ∆x = 5 (0,−1) (5, 6) Figure 3.67: The line has y-intercept (0,−1) and slope 7/5. 206 CHAPTER 3.

However, suppose that the y-intercept is unknown? Instead, suppose that we are given a point (x0, y0) on the line and we’re also told that the slope of the line is m (see Figure 3.71). x y (x0, y0) (x, y) Slope = m Figure 3.71: A line through the point (x0, y0) with slope m. Let (x, y) be an arbitrary point on the line, then use the points (x0, y0) and (x, y) to calculate the slope of the line. Slope = ∆y ∆x The slope formula. m = y − y0 x− x0 Substitute m for the slope. Use (x, y)and (x0, y0) to calculate the difference in y and the difference in x. Clear the fractions from the equation by multiplying both sides by the common denominator. m(x− x0) = [ y − y0 x− x0 ] (x− x0) Multiply both sides by x− x0. m(x− x0) = y − y0 Cancel. Thus, the equation of the line is y − y0 = m(x− x0). 214 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING The Point-Slope form of a line. The equation of the line with slope m that passes through the point (x0, y0) is: y − y0 = m(x− x0) You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Draw the line passing through the point (−3,−1) that hasDraw the line passing through the point (1,−2) that has slope 3/2, then label it with its equation. slope 3/5, then label it with its equation. Solution: Plot the point (−3,−1), then move 3 units up and 5 units to the right (see Figure 3.72). To find the equation, substitute (−3,−1) for (x0, y0) and 3/5 for m in the point-slope form of the line. y − y0 = m(x− x0) Point-slope form. y − (−1) = 3 5 (x− (−3)) Substitute: 3/5 for m, −3 for x0, and −1 for y0. Simplifying, the equation of the line is y + 1 = 35 (x+ 3). −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 3 ∆x = 5 (−3,−1) y + 1 = 3 5 (x+ 3) Figure 3.72: The line passing through (−3,−1) with slope 3/5. Answer: −5 5 −5 5 x y (1,−2) y + 2 = 3 2 (x− 1) ! At this point, you may be asking the question “When should I use the slop- intercept form and when should I use the point-slope form?” Here is a good tip. Tip. Which form should I use? The form you should select depends upon the information given. 3.5. POINT-SLOPE FORM OF A LINE 215 1. If you are given the y-intercept and the slope, use y = mx+ b. 2. If you are given a point and the slope, use y − y0 = m(x− x0). You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Find the equation of the line passing through the points Find the equation of the line passing through the points P (−2, 1) and Q(4,−1). P (−1, 2) and Q(3,−4). Solution: First, plot the points P (−1, 2) andQ(3,−4) and draw a line through them (see Figure 3.73). −5 5 −5 5 x y P (−1, 2) Q(3,−4) Figure 3.73: The line passing through P (−1, 2) and Q(3,−4). Next, let’s calculate the slope of the line by subtracting the coordinates of the point P (−1, 2) from the coordinates of point Q(3,−4). Slope = ∆y ∆x = −4− 2 3− (−1) = −6 4 = −3 2 Thus, the slope is −3/2. Next, use the point-slope form y−y0 = m(x−x0) to determine the equation of the line. It’s clear that we should substitute −3/2 for m. But which of the two points should we use? If we use the point P (−1, 2) for (x0, y0), we get the answer on the left, but if we use the point Q(3,−4) for (x0, y0), we get the 216 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING answer on the right. y − 2 = −3 2 (x− (−1)) or y − (−4) = −3 2 (x− 3) At first glance, these answers do not look the same, but let’s examine them a bit more closely, solving for y to put each in slope-intercept form. Let’s start with the equation on the left. y − 2 = −3 2 (x− (−1)) Using m = −3/2 and (x0, y0) = (−1, 2). y − 2 = −3 2 (x+ 1) Simplify. y − 2 = −3 2 x− 3 2 Distribute −3/2. y − 2 + 2 = −3 2 x− 3 2 + 2 Add 2 to both sides. y = −3 2 x− 3 2 + 4 2 On the left, simplify. On the right, make equivalent fractions with a common denominator. y = −3 2 x+ 1 2 Simplify. Let’s put the second equation in slope-intercept form.Note that the form y = − 32x+ 12 , when compared with the general slope-intercept form y = mx+ b, indicates that the y-intercept is (0, 1/2). Examine Figure 3.73. Does it appear that the y-intercept is (0, 1/2)? y − (−4) = −3 2 (x− 3) Using m = −3/2 and (x0, y0) = (3,−4). y + 4 = −3 2 (x− 3) Simplify. y + 4 = −3 2 x+ 9 2 Distribute −3/2. y + 4− 4 = −3 2 x+ 9 2 − 4 Subtract 4 from both sides. y = −3 2 x+ 9 2 − 8 2 On the left, simplify. On the right, make equivalent fractions with a common denominator. y = −3 2 x+ 1 2 Simplify. Thus, both equations simplify to the same answer, y = − 32x+ 12 . This means that the equations y − 2 = − 32 (x − (−1)) and y − (−4) = − 32 (x − 3), though they look different, are the same.Answer: y = −1 3 x+ 1 3 ! 3.5. POINT-SLOPE FORM OF A LINE 217 Example 2 gives rise to the following tip. Tip. When finding the equation of a line through two points P and Q, you may substitute either point P or Q for (x0, y0) in the point-slope form y−y0 = m(x− x0). The results look different, but they are both equations of the same line.  || Parallel Lines Recall that slope is a number that measures the steepness of the line. If two lines are parallel (never intersect), they have the same steepness. Parallel lines. If two lines are parallel, they have the same slope. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Sketch the line y = 34x − 2, then sketch the line passing Find the equation of the line which passes through the point (2,−3) and is parallel to the line y = 3 2 x+ 1. through the point (−1, 1) that is parallel to the line y = 34x − 2. Find the equation of this parallel line. Solution: Note that y = 34x− 2 is in slope-intercept form y = mx+ b. Hence, its slope is 3/4 and its y-intercept is (0,−2). Plot the y-intercept (0,−2), move up 3 units, right 4 units, then draw the line (see Figure 3.74). −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 3 ∆x = 4 (0,−2) Figure 3.74: The line y = 34x− 2. −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 3 ∆x = 4 (−1, 1) Figure 3.75: Adding a line parallel to y = 34x− 2. The second line must be parallel to the first, so it must have the same slope 3/4. Plot the point (−1, 1), move up 3 units, right 4 units, then draw the line (see the red line in Figure 3.75). 218 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING To find the equation of the parallel red line in Figure 3.75, use the point- slope form, substitute 3/4 for m, then (−1, 1) for (x0, y0). That is, substitute −1 for x0 and 1 for y0. y − y0 = m(x− x0) Point-slope form. y − 1 = 3 4 ( x− (−1)) Substitute: 3/4 for m, −1 for x0, and 1 for y0. y − 1 = 3 4 (x+ 1) Simplify. Check: In this example, we were not required to solve for y, so we can save ourselves some checking work by writing the equation y − 1 = 3 4 (x+ 1) in the form y = 3 4 (x+ 1) + 1 by adding 1 to both sides of the first equation.

POINT-SLOPE FORM OF A LINE 219  || Perpendicular Lines Two lines are perpendicular if they meet and form a right angle (90 degrees). For example, the lines L1 and L2 in Figure 3.80 are perpendicular, but the lines L1 and L2 in Figure 3.81 are not perpendicular. x y L1 L2 Figure 3.80: The lines L1 and L2 are perpendicular. They meet and form a right angle (90 degrees). x y L1 L2 Figure 3.81: The lines L1 and L2 are not perpendicular. They do not form a right angle (90 degrees). Before continuing, we need to establish a relation between the slopes of two perpendicular lines. So, consider the perpendicular lines L1 and L2 in Figure 3.82. x y L1 L2 1 m11 −m1 Figure 3.82: Perpendicular lines L1 and L2. Things to note: 1. If we were to rotate line L1 ninety degrees counter-clockwise, then L1 would align with the line L2, as would the right triangles revealing their slopes. 2. L1 has slope ∆y ∆x = m1 1 = m1. 220 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING 3. L2 has slope ∆y ∆x = 1 −m1 = − 1 m1 . Slopes of perpendicular lines. If L1 and L2 are perpendicular lines and L1 has slope m1, the L2 has slope −1/m1. That is, the slope of L2 is the negative reciprocal of the slope of L1. Examples: To find the slope of a perpendicular line, invert the slope of the first line and negate. • If the slope of L1 is 2, then the slope of the perpendicular line L2 is −1/2. • If the slope of L1 is −3/4, then the slope of the perpendicular line L2 is 4/3.

(2, 1) that is perpendicular to the line y = − 23x− 3. Find the equation of this perpendicular line. Solution: Note that y = − 23x−3 is in slope-intercept form y = mx+b. Hence, its slope is −2/3 and its y-intercept is (0,−3). Plot the y-intercept (0,−3), move right 3 units, down two units, then draw the line (see Figure 3.83). −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆x = 3 ∆y = −2(0,−3) Figure 3.83: The line y = − 23x− 3. −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 3 ∆x = 2 (2, 1) Figure 3.84: Adding a line perpen- dicular to y = − 23x− 3. Because the line y = − 23x−3 has slope −2/3, the slope of the line perpendicular to this line will be the negative reciprocal of −2/3, namely 3/2. Thus, to draw the perpendicular line, start at the given point (2, 1), move up 3 units, right 2 units, then draw the line (see Figure 3.84). 3.5. POINT-SLOPE FORM OF A LINE 221 To find the equation of the perpendicular line in Figure 3.84, use the point- slope form, substitute 3/2 for m, then (2, 1) for (x0, y0). That is, substitute 2 for x0, then 1 for y0. y − y0 = m(x− x0) Point-slope form. y − 1 = 3 2 (x− 2) Substitute: 3/2 for m, 2 for x0, and 1 for y0. Check: In this example, we were not required to solve for y, so we can save ourselves some checking work by writing the equation y − 1 = 3 2 (x − 2) in the form y = 3 2 (x− 2) + 1 by adding 1 to both sides of the first equation.

Figure 3.86: 6:ZStandard pro- duces two lines that do not look perpendicular. Note that the lines in Figure 3.86 do not appear to be perpendicular. Have we done something wrong? The answer is no! The fact that the calculator’s viewing screen is wider than it is tall is distorting the angle at which the lines meet.

Figure 3.88: 5:ZSquare produces two lines that do look perpendicu- lar.  || 3.6 Standard Form of a Line In this section we will investigate the standard form of a line. Let’s begin with a simple example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve the equation 2x+ 3y = 6 for y and plot the result.Solve x− 2y = 6 for y and plot the result. Solution: First we solve the equation 2x + 3y = 6 for y. Begin by isolating all terms containing y on one side of the equation, moving or keeping all the remaining terms on the other side of the equation. 2x+ 3y = 6 Original equation. 2x+ 3y − 2x = 6− 2x Subtract 2x from both sides. 3y = 6− 2x Simplify. 3y 3 = 6− 2x 3 Divide both sides by 3. When dividing a sum or a difference by a number, we use the distributiveJust as multiplication is dis- tributive with respect to ad- dition a(b+ c) = ab+ ac, so too is division distributive with respect to addition. a+ b c = a c + b c property and divide both terms by that number. y = 6 3 − 2x 3 On the left, simplify. On the right, divide both terms by 3. y = 2− 2x 3 Simplify. Finally, use the commutative property to switch the order of the terms on the right-hand side of the last result. y = 2 + ( −2x 3 ) Add the opposite. y = −2 3 x+ 2 Use the commutative property to switch the order. Because the equation 2x+ 3y = 6 is equivalent to the equation y = − 23x + 2, the graph of 2x + 3y = 6 is a line, having slope m = −2/3 and y-intercept (0, 2). Therefore, to draw the graph of 2x+ 3y = 6, plot the y-intercept (0, 2), move down 2 and 3 to the right, then draw the line (see Figure 3.90). Answer: −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 1 ∆x = 2 (0,−3) ! In general, unless B = 0, we can always solve the equation Ax + By = CThe form Ax + By = C, where either A = 0 or B = 0, will be handled at the end of this section. 3.6. STANDARD FORM OF A LINE 229 −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = −2 ∆x = 3 (0, 2) Figure 3.90: The graph of 2x+ 3y = 6, or equivalently, y = − 23x+ 2. for y: Ax+By = C Original equation. Ax +By −Ax = C −Ax Subtract Ax from both sides. By = C −Ax Simplify. By B = C −Ax B Divide both sides by B, possible if B != 0. y = C B − Ax B On the left, simplify. On the right distribute the B. y = −A B x+ C B Commutative property. Note that the last result is in slope-intercept form y = mx+ b, whose graph is a line. We have established the following result. Fact. The graph of the equation Ax +By = C, is a line. Important points. A couple of important comments are in order. 1. The form Ax + By = C requires that the coefficients A, B, and C are integers. So, for example, we would clear the fractions from the form 1 2 x+ 2 3 y = 1 4 230 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING by multiplying both sides by the least common denominator. 12 ( 1 2 x+ 2 3 y ) = ( 1 4 ) 12 6x+ 8y = 3 Note that the coefficients are now integers. 2. The form Ax + By = C also requires that the first coefficient A is non- negative; i.e., A ≥ 0. Thus, if we have −5x+ 2y = 6, then we would multiply both sides by −1, arriving at: −1(−5x+ 2y) = (6)(−1) 5x− 2y = −6 Note that A = 5 is now greater than or equal to zero. 3. If A, B, and C have a common divisor greater than 1, it is recommended that we divide both sides by the common divisor, thus “reducing” the coefficients. For example, if we have 3x+ 12y = −24, then dividing both side by 3 “reduces” the size of the coefficients. 3x+ 12y 3 = −24 3 x+ 4y = −8 Standard form. The form Ax + By = C, where A, B, and C are integers, and A ≥ 0, is called the standard form of a line.  || Slope-Intercept to Standard Form We’ve already transformed a couple of equations in standard form into slope- intercept form. Let’s reverse the process and place an equation in slope- intercept form into standard form. 3.6. STANDARD FORM OF A LINE 231 You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Given the graph of the line in Figure 3.91, find the equation Given the graph of the line below, find the equation of the line in standard form. −5 5 −5 5 x y of the line in standard form. −5 5 −5 5 x y Figure 3.91: Determine the equa- tion of the line. −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 5 ∆x = −2 (0,−3) Figure 3.92: The line has y- intercept (0,−3) and slope −5/2. Solution: The line intercepts the y-axis at (0,−3). From (0,−3), move up 5 units, then left 2 units. Thus, the line has slope ∆y/∆x = −5/2 (see Figure 3.92). Substitute −5/2 for m and −3 for b in the slope-intercept form of the line. y = mx+ b Slope-intercept form. y = −5 2 x− 3 Substitute: −5/2 for m, −3 for b. To put this result in standard form Ax + By = C, first clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by the common denominator. 2y = 2 [ −5 2 x− 3 ] Multiply both sides by 2. 2y = 2 [ −5 2 x ] − 2 [3] Distribute the 2. 2y = −5x− 6 Multiply. That clears the fractions. To put this last result in the form Ax+By = C, we need to move the term −5x to the other side of the equation. 5x+ 2y = −5x− 6 + 5x Add 5x to both sides. 5x+ 2y = −6 Simplify. 232 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING Thus, the standard form of the line is 5x + 2y = −6. Note that all the coeffi- cients are integers and the terms are arranged in the order Ax+By = C, with A ≥ 0.Answer: 3x− 4y = −2 !  || Point-Slope to Standard Form Let’s do an example where we have to put the point-slope form of a line in standard form.

STANDARD FORM OF A LINE 233 Let’s substitute (x0, y0) = (1, 2) and m = 3/2 in the point-slope form of the line. (Note: Substituting (x0, y0) = (−3,−4) and m = 3/2 would yield the same answer.) y − y0 = m(x− x0) Point-slope form. y − 2 = 3 2 (x− 1) Substitute: 3/2 for m, 1 for x0, and 2 for y0. The question requests that our final answer be presented in standard form. First we clear the fractions. If we fail to reduce the slope to lowest terms, then the equation of the line would be: y − 2 = 6 4 (x− 1) Multiplying both sides by 4 would give us the result 4y − 8 = 6x− 6, or equivalently: −6x+ 4y = 2 This doesn’t look like the same answer, but if we divide both sides by −2, we do get the same result. 3x− 2y = −1 This shows the importance of requiring A ≥ 0 and “re- ducing” the coefficients A, B, and C. It allows us to com- pare our answer with our col- leagues or the answers pre- sented in this textbook. y − 2 = 3 2 x− 3 2 Distribute the 3/2. 2 [y − 2] = 2 [ 3 2 x− 3 2 ] Multiply both sides by 2. 2y − 2[2] = 2 [ 3 2 x ] − 2 [ 3 2 ] Distribute the 2. 2y − 4 = 3x− 3 Multiply. Now that we’ve cleared the fractions, we must order the terms in the form Ax+By = C. We need to move the term 3x to the other side of the equation. 2y − 4− 3x = 3x− 3− 3x Subtract 3x from both sides. −3x+ 2y − 4 = −3 Simplify, changing the order on the left-hand side. To put this in the form Ax + By = C, we need to move the term −4 to the other side of the equation. −3x+ 2y − 4 + 4 = −3 + 4 Add 4 to both sides. −3x+ 2y = 1 Simplify. It appears that −3x+ 2y = 1 is in the form Ax+By = C. However, standard form requires that A ≥ 0. We have A = −3. To fix this, we multiply both sides by −1. −1 [−3x+ 2y] = −1 [1] Multiply both sides by −1. 3x− 2y = −1 Distribute the −1. Thus, the equation of the line in standard form is 3x− 2y = −1. Answer: 7x+ 5y = 6 ! 234 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING  || Intercepts We’ve studied the y-intercept, the point where the graph crosses the y-axis, but equally important are the x-intercepts, the points where the graph crosses the x-axis. In Figure 3.94, the graph crosses the x-axis three times. Each of these crossing points is called an x-intercept. Note that each of these x-intercepts has a y-coordinate equal to zero. This leads to the following rule. x-Intercepts. To find the x-intercepts of the graph of an equation, substitute y = 0 into the equation and solve for x. Similarly, the graph in Figure 3.95 crosses the y-axis three times. Each of these crossing points is called a y-intercept. Note that each of these y-intercepts has an x-coordinate equal to zero. This leads to the following rule. y-Intercepts. To find the y-intercepts of the graph of an equation, substitute x = 0 into the equation and solve for y. x y ( , 0) ( , 0) ( , 0) Figure 3.94: Each x-intercept has a y-coordinate equal to zero. x y (0, ) (0, ) (0, ) Figure 3.95: Each y-intercept has an x-coordinate equal to zero.

Plot the intercepts and draw the line. 3.6. STANDARD FORM OF A LINE 235 Solution: We know that the graph of 2x − 3y = 6 is a line. Furthermore, two points completely determine a line. This means that we need only plot the x- and y-intercepts, then draw a line through them. To find the x-intercept of 2x−3y = 6, substitute 0 for y and solve for x. 2x− 3y = 6 2x− 3(0) = 6 2x = 6 2x 2 = 6 2 x = 3 Thus, the x-intercept of the line is (3, 0). To find the y-intercept of 2x−3y = 6, substitute 0 for x and solve for y. 2x− 3y = 6 2(0)− 3y = 6 −3y = 6 −3y −3 = 6 −3 y = −2 Thus, the y-intercept of the line is (0,−2).

Find the equation of this perpendicular line. Solution: Let’s first find the x- and y-intercepts of the line 4x+ 3y = 12. 236 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING To find the x-intercept of the line 4x+3y = 12, substitute 0 for y and solve for x. 4x+ 3y = 12 4x+ 3(0) = 12 4x = 12 4x 4 = 12 4 x = 3 Thus, the x-intercept of the line is (3, 0). To find the y-intercept of the line 4x+3y = 12, substitute 0 for x and solve for y. 4x+ 3y = 12 4(0) + 3y = 12 3y = 12 3y 3 = 12 3 y = 4 Thus, the y-intercept of the line is (0, 4). Plot the intercepts and draw a line through them. Note that it is clear fromYou could also solve for y to put 3x + 4y = 12 in slope- intercept form in order to de- termine the slope. the graph that the slope of the line 3x+ 4y = 12 is −4/3 (see Figure 3.97). −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = −4 ∆x = 3 (3, 0) (0, 4) Figure 3.97: The graph of 4x+3y = 12 has intercepts (3, 0) and (0, 4) and slope −4/3. −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 3 ∆x = 4 (−2,−2) Figure 3.98: The slope of the per- pendicular line is the negative re- ciprocal of −4/3, namely 3/4. Because the slope of 3x+4y = 12 is −4/3, the slope of a line perpendicular to 3x + 4y = 12 will be the negative reciprocal of −4/3, namely 3/4. Our perpendicular line has to pass through the point (−2,−2). Start at (−2,−2), move 3 units upward, then 4 units to the right, then draw the line. It should appear to be perpendicular to the line 3x+ 4y = 12 (see Figure 3.98). Finally, use the point-slope form, m = 3/4, and (x0, y0) = (−2,−2) to 3.6. STANDARD FORM OF A LINE 237 determine the equation of the perpendicular line. y − y0 = m(x− x0) Point-slope form. y − (−2) = 3 4 (x− (−2)) Substitute: 3/4 for m, −2 for x0, and −2 for y0. y + 2 = 3 4 (x+ 2) Simplify. Let’s place our answer in standard form. Clear the fractions. y + 2 = 3 4 x+ 6 4 Distribute 3/4. 4 [y + 2] = 4 [ 3 4 x+ 6 4 ] Multiply both sides by 4. 4y + 4[2] = 4 [ 3 4 x ] + 4 [ 6 4 ] Distribute the 4. 4y + 8 = 3x+ 6 Multiply. Rearrange the terms to put them in the order Ax+By = C. 4y + 8− 3x = 3x+ 6− 3x Subtract 3x from both sides. −3x+ 4y + 8 = 6 Simplify. Rearrange on the left. −3x+ 4y + 8− 8 = 6− 8 Subtract 8 from both sides. −3x+ 4y = −2 Simplify. −1(−3x+ 4y) = −1(−2) Multiply both sides by −1. 3x− 4y = 2 Distribute the −1. Hence, the equation of the perpendicular line is 3x− 4y = 2. Answer: 5x+ 6y = 27 !  || Horizontal and Vertical Lines Here we keep an earlier promise to address what happens to the standard form Ax + By = C when either A = 0 or B = 0. For example, the form 3x = 6, when compared with the standard form Ax + By = C, has B = 0. Similarly, the form 2y = −12, when compared with the standard form Ax + By = C, has A = 0. Of course, 3x = 6 can be simplified to x = 2 and 2y = −12 can be simplified to y = −6. Thus, if either A = 0 or B = 0, the standard form Ax+By = C takes the form x = a and y = b, respectively. As we will see in the next example, the form x = a produces a vertical line, while the form y = b produces a horizontal line. 238 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Sketch the graphs of x = 3 and y = −3.Sketch the graphs of x = −2 and y = 2. Solution: To sketch the graph of x = 3, recall that the graph of an equation is the set of all points that satisfy the equation. Hence, to draw the graph of x = 3, we must plot all of the points that satisfy the equation x = 3; that is, we must plot all of the points that have an x-coordinate equal to 3. The result is shown in Figure 3.99. Secondly, to sketch the graph of y = −3, we plot all points having a y- coordinate equal to −3. The result is shown in Figure 3.100. −5 5 −5 5 x y x = 3 Figure 3.99: The graph of x = 3 is a vertical line. −5 5 −5 5 x y y = −3 Figure 3.100: The graph of y = −3 is a horizontal line. Things to note: A couple of comments are in order regarding the lines in Figures 3.99 and 3.100. 1. The graph of x = 3 in Figure 3.99, being a vertical line, has undefined slope. Therefore, we cannot use either of the formulae y = mx + b or y − y0 = m(x− x0) to obtain the equation of the line. The only way we can obtain the equation is to note that the line is the set of all points (x, y) whose x-coordinate equals 3. 2. However, the graph of y = −3, being a horizontal line, has slope zero, so we can use the slope-intercept form to find the equation of the line. Note that the y-intercept of this graph is (0,−3). If we substitute these numbers into y = mx+ b, we get: y = mx+ b Slope-intercept form. y = 0x+ (−3) Substitute: 0 for m, −3 for b. y = −3 Simplify. 3.6. STANDARD FORM OF A LINE 239 However, it is far easier to just look at the line in Figures 3.100 and note that it is the collection of all points (x, y) with y = 3.
