Division of Signed Numbers We can determine the sign pattern for division by relating division to multiplication. Division is defined in terms of multiplication in the following way. If b⋅c = a , then . For example, since 3⋅4 = 12 , it follows that . Notice the pattern: Since , it follows that The sign pattern for division follows from the sign pattern for multiplication. Since , it follows that , that is, Since , it follows that , that is, Since , it follows that , that is, Since , it follows that , that is We have the following rules for dividing signed numbers. Rules for Dividing Signed Numbers To divide two real numbers that have the same sign, divide their absolute values. The quotient is positive. opposite signs, divide their absolute values. The quotient is negative. Division of Signed Numbers We can determine the sign pattern for division by relating division to multiplication.
