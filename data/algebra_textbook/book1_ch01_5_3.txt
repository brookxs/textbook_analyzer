Reducing Fractions To Lowest Terms Reduced to Lowest Terms It is often useful to convert one fraction to an equivalent fraction that has reduced values in the numerator and denominator. When a fraction is converted to an equivalent fraction that has the smallest numerator and denominator in the collection of equivalent fractions, it is said to be reduced to lowest terms. The conversion process is called reducing a fraction. We can reduce a fraction to lowest terms by Expressing the numerator and denominator as a product of prime numbers. (Find the prime factorization of the numerator and denominator. See Section (Section 1.3) for this technique.) Divide the numerator and denominator by all common factors. (This technique is commonly called “cancelling.”) Reducing Fractions To Lowest Terms Reduced to Lowest Terms It is often useful to convert one fraction to an equivalent fraction that has reduced values in the numerator and denominator.
