Solution: Because there is a power of x larger than one, the equation is nonlinear. Make one side equal to zero. 2x2 = 13x− 20 Original equation. 2x2 − 13x+ 20 = 0 Make one side zero. Compare 2x2 − 13x+ 20 with ax2 + bx+ c and note that a = 2, b = −13 and c = 20. We need an integer pair whose product is ac = 40 and whose sum is b = −13. The integer pair −5 and −8 comes to mind. Write the middle term as a sum of like terms using this pair. 2x2 − 5x− 8x+ 20 = 0 −13x = −5x− 8x. x(2x− 5)− 4(2x− 5) = 0 Factor by grouping. (x− 4)(2x− 5) = 0 Factor out 2x− 5. We have a product that equals zero. Use the zero product property to complete the solution. x− 4 = 0 or 2x− 5 = 0 x = 4 2x = 5 x = 5 2 Thus, the solutions of 2x2 = 13x− 20 are x = 4 and x = 5/2.

However, even after adjusting the WINDOW parameters (Xmin = −10, Xmax = 10, Ymin = −10, and Ymax = 60), the image resulting from pushing the GRAPH button (see the image on the right in Figure 6.18) does not clearly show the two points of intersection. Figure 6.18: Sketch y = 2x2 and y = 13x− 20. Let’s switch our strategy and work with the equation 2x2 − 13x+ 20 = 0 instead. Load y = 2x2 − 13x + 20 into Y1 in the Y= menu, then select 6:ZStandard from the ZOOM menu to produce the image at the right in Figure 6.19. Figure 6.19: Sketch y = 2x2 − 13x+ 20. To find the solutions of 2x2−13x+20 = 0, we must identify the x-intercepts of the graph in Figure 6.18. Select 2:zero from the CALC menu, then move the left- and right=arrows to move the cursor to the left of the first x-intercept. Press ENTER to mark the “Left bound,” then move the cursor to the right of the x-intercept and press ENTER to mark the “Right bound.” Finally, press ENTER to use the current position of the cursor for your “Guess.” The result is shown in the image on the left in Figure 6.20. Repeat the process to find the rightmost x-intercept. The result is shown in the image on the right in Figure 6.20.

Note that the GCF of 2x3, x2, and 28x is x. Factor out x. x(2x2 + x− 28) = 0 Factor out the GCF. Compare 2x2+x−28 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 2, b = 1 and c = −28. We need an integer pair whose product is ac = −56 and whose sum is b = 1. The integer pair −7 and 8 comes to mind. Write the middle term as a sum of like terms using this pair. x(2x2 − 7x+ 8x− 28) = 0 x = −7x+ 8x. x [ x(2x− 7) + 4(2x− 7)] = 0 Factor by grouping. x(x + 4)(2x− 7) = 0 Factor out 2x− 7. We have a product of three factors that equals zero. By the zero product property, at least one of the factors must equal zero. x = 0 or x+ 4 = 0 or 2x− 7 = 0 x = −4 2x = 7 x = 7 2 6.4.
