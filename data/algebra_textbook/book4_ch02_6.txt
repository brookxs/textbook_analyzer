 || The Commutative Property of Multiplication Commutative Property of Multiplication The product of two whole numbers is the same regardless of the order of the factors. Sample Set A Example 2.35.  Multiply the two whole numbers. 6 ⋅ 7 = 42 7 ⋅ 6 = 42 The numbers 6 and 7 can be multiplied in any order. Regardless of the order they are multiplied, the product is 42. Practice Set A Use the commutative property of multiplication to find the products in two ways. Exercise 2.6.1. (Go to Solution) Exercise 2.6.2. (Go to Solution)  || The Associative Property of Multiplication Associative Property of Multiplication If three whole numbers are multiplied, the product will be the same if the first two are multiplied first and then that product is multiplied by the third, or if the second two are multiplied first and that product is multiplied by the first. Note that the order of the factors is maintained. It is a common mathematical practice to use parentheses to show which pair of numbers is to be combined first. Sample Set B Example 2.36.  Multiply the whole numbers. ( 8 ⋅ 3 ) ⋅ 14 = 24 ⋅ 14 = 336 8 ⋅ ( 3 ⋅ 14 ) = 8 ⋅ 42 = 336 Practice Set B Use the associative property of multiplication to find the products in two ways. Exercise 2.6.3. (Go to Solution) Exercise 2.6.4. (Go to Solution)  || The Multiplicative Identity The Multiplicative Identity is 1 The whole number 1 is called the multiplicative identity, since any whole num­ber multiplied by 1 is not changed. Sample Set C Example 2.37.  Multiply the whole numbers. 12 ⋅ 1 = 12 1 ⋅ 12 = 12 Practice Set C Multiply the whole numbers. Exercise 2.6.5. (Go to Solution)  ||
