Repeating Fractions The only time this method does not work is for repeating fractions. We know that 1/3 = 0.3333333... but how could we go from 0.3333333... back to 1/3? There is no ‘last decimal place’ because the decimals repeat forever. Fortunately, there is a simple trick for this: ·         Put the repeating digit over a denominator of 9. So we see that in the case of 0.3333333...., the repeating digit is 3, and we make the fraction 3/9, which reduces to 1/3. If there is a group of more than one digit that repeats, Put the repeating group of digits over as many 9’s as there are digits. For example, in the fraction we see that the group of digits ‘15’ repeats, so we put ‘15’ over a denominator of ‘99’ to get o        One warning: This only works for the repeating fraction part of a number. If you have a number like 2.33333..., you should just work with the decimal part and rejoin it with the whole part after you have converted it to a fraction. o        Irrational numbers like p or  have non-repeating decimals, and so they cannot be written as fractions. You can, however, round them off at some point and produce an approximate fraction for them.   Why This Trick Works  If you have learned enough algebra to follow these steps, it is not difficult to see why this works. Let’s start with the simple example 0.3333333... Since we already know that the answer is 1/3, we can concentrate on the procedure, not the answer. Let x = 0.3333333... Multiply both sides by 10 to get 10x = 3.33333... Notice that the decimal part (.33333…) is still the same. In fact, it is the very thing that we called x in the first place, so we can say that 10x= 3 + x Now solve for x: This method will also work for repeating fractions that contain a group of repeating digits, but you have to multiply by a higher power of 10 in order to make the decimal portion stay the same as it was before. For example, suppose we had 0.345345345.... Let x = 0.345345345.... Multiply both sides by 1000 to get 1000x = 345.345345345.... Notice that the decimal part is still the same. In fact, it is still the thing that we called x in the first place, so we can say that 1000x = 345 + x Now solve for x:     Repeating Fractions The only time this method does not work is for repeating fractions.
