2.2 Solving Equations: Multiple Steps Recall the “Wrap” and “Unwrap” discussion from Section 2.1. To wrap a present we put the gift paper on, put the tape on, and put the decorative bow on. To unwrap the gift, we must “undo” each of these steps in inverse order. Hence, to unwrap the gift we take off the decorative bow, take off the tape, and take off the gift paper. Now, imagine a machine that multiplies its input by 3, then adds 5 to the result. This machine is pictured on the left in Figure 2.4. 1. Multiply by 3. 2. Add 5. x 1. Subtract 5. 2.

To “unwrap” the effect of the machine on the left, we need a machine that will “undo” each of the steps of the first machine, but in inverse order. The “unwrapping” machine is pictured on the right in Figure 2.4. It will first sub- tract 5 from its input, then divide the result by 3. Note that each of these operations “undoes” the corresponding operation of the first machine, but in inverse order. The following argument shows that the second machine “undoes” the op- eration of the first machine. 1. Drop the integer 4 into the machine on the left in Figure 2.4.

Consider, for example, the equation 2x+3 = 5−7x. In cases like this, it is helpful to have a general understanding of what it means to “solve for x.” Solve for x. When asked to solve an equation for x, the goal is to manipulate the equation into the final form x = “Stuff”, 2.2. SOLVING EQUATIONS: MULTIPLE STEPS 91 where “Stuff” is a valid mathematical expression that may contain other vari- ables, mathematical symbols, etc., but it must not contain any occurrence of the variable x. In this section, “Stuff” will always be a single number, but in Section 2.4, Formulae, “Stuff” will take on added complexity, including variables other than x. Strategy for solving for x. When asked to solve an equation for x, a common strategy is to isolate all terms containing the variable x on one side of the equation and move all terms not containing the variable x to the other side of the equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve 3− 2x = 5x+ 9 for x. Solve for x: 4x+ 7 = 5− 8xSolution: We need to isolate all terms containing x on one side of the equation. We can eliminate 5x from the right-hand side of 3−2x = 5x+9 by subtracting 5x from both sides of the equation. 3− 2x = 5x+ 9 Original equation. 3− 2x− 5x = 5x+ 9− 5x Subtract 5x from both sides. 3− 7x = 9 Simplify both sides. Next, eliminate 3 from the left-hand side of the last equation by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation. 3− 7x− 3 = 9− 3 Subtract 3 from both sides. −7x = 6 Simplify both sides. Note how we have isolated all terms containing x on one side of the equation. −7x −7 = 6 −7 Divide both sides by −7. x = −6 7 Simplify both sides. 92 CHAPTER 2.

Multiply: −3(4− 2x) = −12 + 6x. 12x− 10 = −34 Add: 6x+ 6x = 12x. Add: 2− 12 = −10. To “undo” subtracting 10, we add 10 to both sides of the equation. 12x− 10 + 10 = −34 + 10 Add 10 to both sides. 12x = −24 Simplify both sides. To “undo” multiplying by 12, we divide both sides by 12. 12x 12 = −24 12 Divide both sides by 12. x = −2 Simplify both sides. Check: Let’s use the TI-84 to check this solution. 2.2.

On the right, distribute the 4. 12x− 15 = 4x− 4 On the left, add: 2x+ 10x = 12x 94 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Next, we need to isolate terms containing the variable x on one side of the equation. To remove the term 4x from the right-hand side, we subtract 4x from both sides of the equation. 12x− 15− 4x = 4x− 4− 4x Subtract 4x from both sides. 8x− 15 = −4 Simplify both sides. To remove the term −15 from the left-hand side, we add 15 to both sides of the equation. 8x− 15 + 15 = −4 + 15 Add 15 to both sides. 8x = 11 Simplify both sides. Finally, to “undo” multiplying by 8, we divide both sides by 8. 8x 8 = 11 8 Divide both sides by 8. x = 11 8 Simplify both sides. Check: Let’s use the TI-84 to check this solution. 1.
