 || Multiplication Multiplication is a description of repeated addition. In the addition of 5 + 5 + 5 the number 5 is repeated 3 times. Therefore, we say we have three times five and describe it by writing 3 × 5 Thus, 3 × 5 = 5 + 5 + 5 Multiplicand In a multiplication, the repeated addend (number being added) is called the multi­plicand. In 3 × 5, the 5 is the multiplicand. Multiplier Also, in a multiplication, the number that records the number of times the multiplicand is used is called the multiplier. In 3 × 5, the 3 is the multiplier. Sample Set A Express each repeated addition as a multiplication. In each case, specify the multiplier and the multiplicand. Example 2.1.  7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 6 × 7. Multiplier is 6. Multiplicand is 7. Example 2.2.  18 + 18 + 18 3 × 18. Multiplier is 3. Multiplicand is 18. Practice Set A Express each repeated addition as a multiplication. In each case, specify the multiplier and the multiplicand. Exercise 2.2.1. (Go to Solution) 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 __________.

Multiplicand is __________. Factors In a multiplication, the numbers being multiplied are also called factors. Products The result of a multiplication is called the product. In 3 × 5 = 15, the 3 and 5 are not only called the multiplier and multiplicand, but they are also called factors. The product is 15. Indicators of Multiplication × ,⋅,( ) The multiplication symbol ( × ) is not the only symbol used to indicate multiplication. Other symbols include the dot ( ⋅ ) and pairs of parentheses ( ). The expressions 3 × 5, 3⋅5, 3(5), (3)5, (3)(5) all represent the same product.  || The Multiplication Process With a Single Digit Multiplier Since multiplication is repeated addition, we should not be surprised to notice that carrying can occur. Carrying occurs when we find the product of 38 and 7: First, we compute 7 × 8 = 56. Write the 6 in the ones column. Carry the 5. Then take 7 × 3 = 21. Add to 21 the 5 that was carried: 21 + 5 = 26. The product is 266. Sample Set B Find the following products. Example 2.3.  The product is 192. Example 2.4.  The product is 2,630. Example 2.5.  The product is 16,236.

(Go to Solution)  || The Multiplication Process With a Multiple Digit Multiplier In a multiplication in which the multiplier is composed of two or more digits, the multiplication must take place in parts. The process is as follows: Part 1: First Partial Product Multiply the multiplicand by the ones digit of the multiplier. This product is called the first partial product. Part 2: Second Partial Product Multiply the multiplicand by the tens digit of the multiplier. This product is called the second partial product. Since the tens digit is used as a factor, the second partial product is written below the first partial product so that its rightmost digit appears in the tens column. Part 3: If necessary, continue this way finding partial products. Write each one below the previous one so that the rightmost digit appears in the column directly below the digit that was used as a factor. Part 4: Total Product Add the partial products to obtain the total product. Note It may be necessary to carry when finding each partial product. Sample Set C Example 2.6.  Multiply 326 by 48. Part 1: Part 2: Part 3: This step is unnecessary since all of the digits in the multiplier have been used. Part 4: Add the partial products to obtain the total product. The product is 15,648. Example 2.7.  Multiply 5,369 by 842. Part 1: Part 2: Part 3: The product is 4,520,698. Example 2.8.  Multiply 1,508 by 206. Part 1: Part 2: Since 0 times 1508 is 0, the partial product will not change the identity of the total product (which is obtained by addition). Go to the next partial product. Part 3: The product is 310,648 Practice Set C Exercise 2.2.10. (Go to Solution) Multiply 73 by 14. Exercise 2.2.11. (Go to Solution) Multiply 86 by 52. Exercise 2.2.12.

(Go to Solution) Multiply 813 by 10,000.  || Multiplications With Numbers Ending in Zero Often, when performing a multiplication, one or both of the factors will end in zeros. Such multiplications can be done quickly by aligning the numbers so that the rightmost nonzero digits are in the same column. Sample Set D Perform the multiplication (49,000)(1,200). Since 9 and 2 are the rightmost nonzero digits, put them in the same column. Draw (perhaps mentally) a vertical line to separate the zeros from the nonzeros. Multiply the numbers to the left of the vertical line as usual, then attach to the right end of this product the total number of zeros. The product is 58,800,000 Practice Set D Exercise 2.2.20. (Go to Solution) Multiply 1,800 by 90. Exercise 2.2.21. (Go to Solution) Multiply 420,000 by 300. Exercise 2.2.22. (Go to Solution) Multiply 20,500,000 by 140,000.  || Calculators Most multiplications are performed using a calculator. Sample Set E Example 2.9.  Multiply 75,891 by 263. Table 2.1. Display Reads Type 75891 75891 Press × 75891 Type 263 263 Press = 19959333 The product is 19,959,333. Example 2.10.  Multiply 4,510,000,000,000 by 1,700. Table 2.2. Display Reads Type 451 451 Press × 451 Type 17 17 Press = 7667 The display now reads 7667. We'll have to add the zeros ourselves. There are a total of 12 zeros. Attaching 12 zeros to 7667, we get 7,667,000,000,000,000. The product is 7,667,000,000,000,000. Example 2.11.  Multiply 57,847,298 by 38,976. Table 2.3. Display Reads Type 57847298 57847298 Press × 57847298 Type 38976 38976 Press = 2.2546563 12 The display now reads 2.2546563 12. What kind of number is this? This is an example of a whole number written in scientific notation. We'll study this concept when we get to decimal numbers. Practice Set E Use a calculator to perform each multiplication.
