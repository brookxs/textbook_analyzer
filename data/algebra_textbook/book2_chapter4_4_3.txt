Mixture Problems Mixture problems Applications involving a mixture of amounts usually given as a percentage of some total. often include a percentage and some total amount. It is important to make a distinction between these two types of quantities. For example, if a problem states that a 20-ounce container is filled with a 2% saline (salt) solution, then this means that the container is filled with a mixture of salt and water as follows: Percentage Amount Salt 2% = 0.02 0.02(20 ounces) = 0.4 ounces Water 98% = 0.98 0.98(20 ounces) = 19.6 ounces In other words, we multiply the percentage times the total to get the amount of each part of the mixture.   Example 5: A 2% saline solution is to be combined and mixed with a 5% saline solution to produce 72 ounces of a 2.5% saline solution. How much of each is needed? Solution: The total amount of saline solution needed is 72 ounces. This leads to one equation, The second equation adds up the amount of salt in the correct percentages. The amount of salt is obtained by multiplying the percentage times the amount, where the variables x and y represent the amounts of the solutions. The algebraic setup consists of both equations presented as a system: Solve. Back substitute. Answer: We need 60 ounces of the 2% saline solution and 12 ounces of the 5% saline solution.   Example 6: A 50% alcohol solution is to be mixed with a 10% alcohol solution to create an 8-ounce mixture of a 32% alcohol solution. How much of each is needed? Solution: The total amount of the mixture must be 8 ounces. The second equation adds up the amount of alcohol from each solution in the correct percentages. The amount of alcohol in the end result is 32% of 8 ounces, or 0.032(8). Now we can form a system of two linear equations and two variables as follows: In this example, multiply the second equation by 100 to eliminate the decimals. In addition, multiply the first equation by −10 to line up the variable y to eliminate. We obtain the following equivalent system: Add the equations and then solve for x: Back substitute. Answer: To obtain 8 ounces of a 32% alcohol mixture we need to mix 4.4 ounces of the 50% alcohol solution and 3.6 ounces of the 10% solution.   Try this! A 70% antifreeze concentrate is to be mixed with water to produce a 5-gallon mixture containing 28% antifreeze. How much water and antifreeze concentrate is needed? Answer: We need to mix 3 gallons of water with 2 gallons of antifreeze concentrate.
