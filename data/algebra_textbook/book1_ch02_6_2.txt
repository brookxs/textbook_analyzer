The Product Rule for Exponents The first rule we wish to develop is the rule for multiplying two exponential quantities having the same base and natural number exponents. The following examples suggest this rule: Example 2.70.  Example 2.71.  PRODUCT RULE FOR EXPONENTS If x is a real number and n and m are natural numbers, x n x m = x n + m To multiply two exponential quantities having the same base, add the exponents. Keep in mind that the exponential quantities being multiplied must have the same base for this rule to apply.
