4.1 Solving Systems by Graphing In this section we introduce a graphical technique for solving systems of two linear equations in two unknowns. As we saw in the previous chapter, if a point satisfies an equation, then that point lies on the graph of the equation. If we are looking for a point that satisfies two equations, then we are looking for a point that lies on the graphs of both equations; that is, we are looking for a point of intersection. For example, consider the the two equations x− 3y = −9 2x+ 3y = 18, −2 8 −2 8 x y (3, 4) x− 3y = −9 2x+ 3y = 18 Figure 4.1: The point of in- tersection is a solution of the system of linear equations. which is called a system of linear equations. The equations are linear equations because their graphs are lines, as shown in Figure 4.1. Note that the two lines in Figure 4.1 intersect at the point (3, 4). Therefore, the point (3, 4) should satisfy both equations. Let’s check. Substitute 3 for x and 4 for y. x− 3y = −9 3− 3(4) = −9 3− 12 = −9 −9 = −9 Substitute 3 for x and 4 for y. 2x+ 3y = 18 2(3) + 3(4) = 18 6 + 12 = 18 18 = 18 Hence, the point (3, 4) satisfies both equations and is called a solution of the system. Solution of a linear system. A point (x, y) is called a solution of a system of two linear equations if and only if it satisfied both equations. Furthermore, because a point satisfies an equation if and only if it lies on the graph of the equation, to solve a system of linear equations graphically, we need to determine the point of intersection of the two lines having the given equations. Let’s try an example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: 2x− 5y = −10 y = x− 1 3x+ 2y = 12 y = x+ 1 (4.1) Solution: We are looking for the point (x, y) that satisfies both equations; that is, we are looking for the point that lies on the graph of both equations. Therefore, the logical approach is to plot the graphs of both lines, then identify the point of intersection. First, let’s determine the x- and y-intercepts of 3x+ 2y = 12. 4.1. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY GRAPHING 247 To find the x-intercept, let y = 0. 3x+ 2y = 12 3x+ 2(0) = 12 3x = 12 x = 4 To find the y-intercept, let x = 0. 3x+ 2y = 12 3(0) + 2y = 12 2y = 12 y = 6 Hence, the x-intercept is (4, 0) and the y-intercept is (0, 6). These intercepts are plotted in Figure 4.2 and the line 3x+ 2y = 12 is drawn through them. Comparing the second equation y = x + 1 with the slope-intercept form y = mx + b, we see that the slope is m = 1 and the y-intercept is (0, 1). Plot the intercept (0, 1), then go up 1 unit and right 1 unit, then draw the line (see Figure 4.3). −2 8 −2 8 x y (4, 0) (0, 6) 3x+ 2y = 12 Figure 4.2: Drawing the graph of 3x+ 2y = 12. −2 8 −2 8 x y 1 1 (0, 1) y = x+ 1 Figure 4.3: Drawing the graph of y = x+ 1. We are trying to find the point that lies on both lines, so we plot both lines on the same coordinate system, labeling each with its equation (see Figure 4.4). It appears that the lines intersect at the point (2, 3), making (x, y) = (2, 3) the solution of System 4.1 (see Figure 4.4). Check: To show that (x, y) = (2, 3) is a solution of System 4.1, we must show that we get true statements when we substitute 2 for x and 3 for y in both equations of System 4.1. 248 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS −2 8 −2 8 x y (2, 3) y = x+ 1 3x+ 2y = 12 Figure 4.4: The coordinates of the point of intersection is the solution of System 4.1. Substituting 2 for x and 3 for y in 3x+ 2y = 12, we get: 3x+ 2y = 12 3(2) + 2(3) = 12 6 + 6 = 12 12 = 12 Hence, (2, 3) satisfies the equation 3x+ 2y = 12. Substituting 2 for x and 3 for y in y = x+ 1, we get: y = x+ 1 3 = 2 + 1 3 = 3 Hence, (2, 3) satisfies the equation y = x+ 1. Because (2, 3) satisfies both equations, this makes (2, 3) a solution of System 4.1. Answer: (5, 4) ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: −4x− 3y = 12 x− 2y = −2 3x− 5y = −15 2x+ y = −4 (4.2) Solution: Once again, we are looking for the point that satisfies both equations of the System 4.2. Thus, we need to find the point that lies on the graphs of both lines represented by the equations of System 4.2. The approach will be to graph both lines, then approximate the coordinates of the point of intersection. First, let’s determine the x- and y-intercepts of 3x− 5y = −15. 4.1. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY GRAPHING 249 To find the x-intercept, let y = 0. 3x− 5y = −15 3x− 5(0) = −15 3x = −15 x = −5 To find the y-intercept, let x = 0. 3x− 5y = −15 3(0)− 5y = −15 −5y = −15 y = 3 Hence, the x-intercept is (−5, 0) and the y-intercept is (0, 3). These intercepts are plotted in Figure 4.5 and the line 3x− 5y = −15 is drawn through them. Next, let’s determine the intercepts of the second equation 2x+ y = −4. To find the x-intercept, let y = 0. 2x+ y = −4 2x+ 0 = −4 2x = −4 x = −2 To find the y-intercept, let x = 0. 2x+ y = −4 2(0) + y = −4 y = −4 Hence, the x-intercept is (−2, 0) and the y-intercept is (0,−4).

Then, in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, we’ll show how to find the exact solution. are plotted in Figure 4.6 and the line 2x+ y = −4 is drawn through them. −10 10 −10 10 x y (−5, 0) (0, 3) 3x− 5y = −15 Figure 4.5: Drawing the graph of the line 3x− 5y = −15. −10 10 −10 10 x y (−2, 0) (0,−4) 2x+ y = −4 Figure 4.6: Drawing the graph of the line 2x+ y = −4. To find the solution of System 4.2, we need to plot both lines on the same coordinate system and determine the coordinates of the point of intersection. Unlike Example 1, in this case we’ll have to be content with an approximation of these coordinates. It appears that the coordinates of the point of intersection are approximately (−2.6, 1.4) (see Figure 4.7). Check: Because we only have an approximation of the solution of the system, we cannot expect the solution to check exactly in each equation. However, we do hope that the solution checks approximately. 250 CHAPTER 4.

Substitute (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) into the first equation of System 4.2. 3x− 5y = −15 3(−2.6)− 5(1.4) = −15 −7.8− 7 = −15 −14.8 = −15 Note that (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) does not check exactly, but it is pretty close to being a true statement. Substitute (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) into the second equation of System 4.2. 2x+ y = −4 2(−2.6) + 1.4 = −4 −5.2 + 1.4 = −4 −3.8 = −4 Again, note that (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) does not check ex- actly, but it is pretty close to being a true statement. Because (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) very nearly makes both equations a true state- ment, it seems that (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) is a reasonable approximation for the solution of System 4.2.Approximate answer: (−2.7,−0.4) ! 4.1 Solving Systems by Graphing In this section we introduce a graphical technique for solving systems of two linear equations in two unknowns.

If we are looking for a point that satisfies two equations, then we are looking for a point that lies on the graphs of both equations; that is, we are looking for a point of intersection. For example, consider the the two equations x− 3y = −9 2x+ 3y = 18, −2 8 −2 8 x y (3, 4) x− 3y = −9 2x+ 3y = 18 Figure 4.1: The point of in- tersection is a solution of the system of linear equations. which is called a system of linear equations. The equations are linear equations because their graphs are lines, as shown in Figure 4.1. Note that the two lines in Figure 4.1 intersect at the point (3, 4). Therefore, the point (3, 4) should satisfy both equations. Let’s check. Substitute 3 for x and 4 for y. x− 3y = −9 3− 3(4) = −9 3− 12 = −9 −9 = −9 Substitute 3 for x and 4 for y. 2x+ 3y = 18 2(3) + 3(4) = 18 6 + 12 = 18 18 = 18 Hence, the point (3, 4) satisfies both equations and is called a solution of the system. Solution of a linear system. A point (x, y) is called a solution of a system of two linear equations if and only if it satisfied both equations. Furthermore, because a point satisfies an equation if and only if it lies on the graph of the equation, to solve a system of linear equations graphically, we need to determine the point of intersection of the two lines having the given equations. Let’s try an example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1.

These intercepts are plotted in Figure 4.2 and the line 3x+ 2y = 12 is drawn through them. Comparing the second equation y = x + 1 with the slope-intercept form y = mx + b, we see that the slope is m = 1 and the y-intercept is (0, 1). Plot the intercept (0, 1), then go up 1 unit and right 1 unit, then draw the line (see Figure 4.3). −2 8 −2 8 x y (4, 0) (0, 6) 3x+ 2y = 12 Figure 4.2: Drawing the graph of 3x+ 2y = 12. −2 8 −2 8 x y 1 1 (0, 1) y = x+ 1 Figure 4.3: Drawing the graph of y = x+ 1.

It appears that the lines intersect at the point (2, 3), making (x, y) = (2, 3) the solution of System 4.1 (see Figure 4.4). Check: To show that (x, y) = (2, 3) is a solution of System 4.1, we must show that we get true statements when we substitute 2 for x and 3 for y in both equations of System 4.1. 248 CHAPTER 4.

Substituting 2 for x and 3 for y in y = x+ 1, we get: y = x+ 1 3 = 2 + 1 3 = 3 Hence, (2, 3) satisfies the equation y = x+ 1.

But there are two exceptions to this general scenario. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: x− y = 3 −2x+ 2y = 4 2x+ 3y = 6 2x+ 3y = −6 (4.3) 4.1. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY GRAPHING 251 Solution: Let’s place each equation in slope-intercept form by solving each equation for y. Solve 2x+ 3y = 6 for y: 2x+ 3y = 6 2x+ 3y − 2x = 6− 2x 3y = 6− 2x 3y 3 = 6− 2x 3 y = −2 3 x+ 2 Solve 2x+ 3y = −6 for y: 2x+ 3y = −6 2x+ 3y − 2x = −6− 2x 3y = −6− 2x 3y 3 = −6− 2x 3 y = −2 3 x− 2 Comparing y = (−2/3)x+2 with the slope-intercept form y = mx+ b tells us that the slope is m = −2/3 and the y-intercept is (0, 2). Plot the intercept (0, 2), then go down 2 units and right 3 units and draw the line (see Figure 4.8). Comparing y = (−2/3)x − 2 with the slope-intercept form y = mx + b tells us that the slope is m = −2/3 and the y-intercept is (0,−2). Plot the intercept (0,−2), then go down 2 units and right 3 units and draw the line (see Figure 4.9). −5 5 −5 5 x y −2 3 (0, 2) 2x+ 3y = 6 Figure 4.8: Drawing the graph of the line 2x+ 3y = 6. −5 5 −5 5 x y −2 3 (0,−2) 2x+ 3y = −6 Figure 4.9: Drawing the graph of the line 2x+ 3y = −6. To find the solution of System 4.3, draw both lines on the same coordinate system (see Figure 4.10). Note how the lines appear to be parallel (they don’t intersect). The fact that both lines have the same slope −2/3 confirms our suspicion that the lines are parallel. However, note that the lines have differ- ent y-intercepts. Hence, we are looking at two parallel but distinct lines (see Figure 4.10) that do not intersect. Hence, System 4.3 has no solution. 252 CHAPTER 4.

Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: −6x+ 3y = −12 2x− y = 4 x− y = 3 −2x+ 2y = −6 (4.4) Solution: Let’s solve both equations for y. Solve x− y = 3 for y: x− y = 3 x− y − x = 3− x −y = −x+ 3 −1(−y) = −1(−x+ 3) y = x− 3 Solve −2x+ 2y = −6 for y: −2x+ 2y = −6 −2x+ 2y + 2x = −6 + 2x 2y = 2x− 6 2y 2 = 2x− 6 2 y = x− 3 Both lines have slope m = 1, and both have the same y-intercept (0,−3). Hence, the two lines are identical (see Figure 4.11). Hence, System 4.4 has an infinite number of points of intersection. Any point on either line is a solution of the system. Examples of points of intersection (solutions satisfying both equations) are (0,−3), (1,−2), and (3, 0). −5 5 −5 5 x y x− y = 3 −2x + 2y = −6 (0,−3) (1,−2) (3, 0) Figure 4.11: x − y = 3 and −2x+ 2y = −6 are the same line. 4.1.

Examples 1, 2, 3, and 4 lead us to the following conclusion. Number of solutions of a linear system. When dealing with a system of two linear equations in two unknowns, there are only three possibilities: 1. There is exactly one solution. 2. There are no solutions. 3. There are an infinite number of solutions.  || Solving Systems with the Graphing Calculator We’ve already had experience graphing equations with the graphing calculator. We’ve also used the TRACE button to estimate points of intersection. How- ever, the graphing calculator has a much more sophisticated tool for finding points of intersection.

Use the graphing calculator to solve the following system of Solve the following system of equations: 2x− 5y = 9 y = 2x− 5 equations: 3x+ 2y = 12 y = x+ 1 (4.5) Solution: To enter an equation in the Y= menu, the equation must first be 254 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS solved for y. Hence, we must first solve 3x+ 2y = 12 for y. 3x+ 2y = 12 Original equation. 2y = 12− 3x Subtract 3x from both sides of the equation. 2y 2 = 12− 3x 2 Divide both sides by 2. y = 12 2 − 3x 2 On the left, simplify. On the right, distribute division by 2. y = 6− 3 2 x Simplify. We can now substitute both equations of System 4.5 into the Y= menu (see Figure 4.12).

Figure 4.13: Select 6:ZStandard to produce the graphs of the sys- tem (4.5) equations. The question now becomes “How do we calculate the coordinates of the point of intersection?” Look on your calculator case just above the TRACE button on the top row of buttons, where you’ll see the word CAlC, painted in the same color as the 2ND key. Press the 2ND key, then the TRACE button, which will open the CALCULATE menu shown in Figure 4.14. Select 5:intersect. The result is shown in Figure 4.15. The calculator has placed the cursor on the curve y = 6 − (3/2)x (see upper left corner of your viewing screen), and in the lower left corner the calculator is asking you if you want to use the selected curve as the “First curve.” Answer “yes” by pressing the ENTER button. Having the calculator ask “First curve,” “Second curve,” when there are only two curves on the screen may seem annoying. However, imagine the situation when there are three or more curves on the screen. Then these questions make good sense. You can change your selection of “First curve” or “Second curve” by using the up-and-down arrow keys to move the cursor to a different curve. The calculator responds as shown Figure 4.16. The cursor jumps to the curve y = x + 1 (see upper left corner of your viewing window), and in the lower left corner the calculator is asking you if you want to use the selected curve as the “Second curve.” Answer “yes” by pressing the ENTER key again. The calculator responds as shown Figure 4.17, asking you to “Guess.” In this case, leave the cursor where it is and press the ENTER key again to signal the calculator that you are making a guess at the current position of the cursor.

Once you have made that change to Xmax, press the GRAPH button to produce the image shown in Figure 4.23. Figure 4.22: Change xmax to 20. Figure 4.23: Press the GRAPH button to produce this window. Now that the point of intersection is visible in the viewing window, press 2ND CALC and select 5:intersect from theCALCULATE menu (see Figure 4.25). Make three consecutive presses of the ENTER button to respond to “First curve,” “Second curve,” and “Guess.” The calculator responds with the im- age in Figure 4.25. Thus, the solution of System 4.6 is approximately (x, y) ≈ (13.54837, 3.1290323). Warning! Your calculator is an approximating machine. It is quite likely that your solutions might differ slightly from the solution presented in Figure 4.25 in the last 2-3 places. Reporting your solution on your homework. In reporting your solution on your homework paper, follow the Calculator Submission Guidelines from Chapter 3, Section 2. Make an accurate copy of the image shown in your viewing window. Label your axes x and y. At the end of each axis, put the appropriate value of Xmin, Xmax, Ymin, and Ymax reported in your 258 CHAPTER 4.
