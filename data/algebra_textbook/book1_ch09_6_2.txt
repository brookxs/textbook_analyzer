The Logic Behind The Process Now we will study methods of simplifying radical expressions such as The procedure for adding and subtracting square root expressions will become apparent if we think back to the procedure we used for simplifying polynomial expressions such as The variables x and a are letters representing some unknown quantities (perhaps x represents and a represents ). Combining like terms gives us The Logic Behind The Process Now we will study methods of simplifying radical expressions such as The procedure for adding and subtracting square root expressions will become apparent if we think back to the procedure we used for simplifying polynomial expressions such as The variables x and a are letters representing some unknown quantities (perhaps x represents and a represents ).
