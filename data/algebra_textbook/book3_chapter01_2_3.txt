Distinction Between Subtraction and Negation The symbol “–” means two different things in math. If it is between two numbers it means subtraction, but if it is in front of one number it means the opposite (or negative) of that number. Subtraction is binary (acts on two numbers), but negation is unary (acts on only one number).           Calculators have two different keys to perform these functions. The key with a plain minus sign is only for subtraction:   Negation is performed by a key that looks like one of these: Remember that subtraction can always be thought of as adding the opposite. In fact, we could get along just fine without ever using subtraction. Distinction Between Subtraction and Negation The symbol “–” means two different things in math.
