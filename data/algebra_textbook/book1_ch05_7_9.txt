Compound Inequalities Compound Inequality Another type of inequality is the compound inequality. A compound inequality is of the form: a < x < b There are actually two statements here. The first statement is a < x . The next statement is x < b . When we read this statement we say " a is less than x ," then continue saying "and x is less than b ." Just by looking at the inequality we can see that the number x is between the numbers a and b . The compound inequality a < x < b indicates "betweenness." Without changing the meaning, the statement a < x can be read x > a . (Surely, if the number a is less than the number x , the number x must be greater than the number a .) Thus, we can read a < x < b as " x is greater than a and at the same time is less than b ." For example: 4 < x < 9 .The letter x is some number strictly between 4 and 9. Hence, x is greater than 4 and, at the same time, less than 9. The numbers 4 and 9 are not included so we use open circles at these points. − 2 < z < 0 .The z stands for some number between − 2 and 0. Hence, z is greater than − 2 but also less than 0. 1 < x + 6 < 8 .The expression x + 6 represents some number strictly between 1 and 8. Hence, x + 6 represents some number strictly greater than 1, but less than 8. .The term represents some number between and including and . Hence, represents some number greater than or equal to to but less than or equal to . Consider problem 3 above, 1 < x + 6 < 8 . The statement says that the quantity x + 6 is between 1 and 8. This statement will be true for only certain values of x . For example, if x = 1 , the statement is true since 1 < 1 + 6 < 8 . However, if x = 4.9 , the statement is false since 1 < 4.9 + 6 < 8 is clearly not true. The first of the inequalities is satisfied since 1 is less than 10.9 , but the second inequality is not satisfied since 10.9 is not less than 8. We would like to know for exactly which values of x the statement 1 < x + 6 < 8 is true. We proceed by using the properties discussed earlier in this section, but now we must apply the rules to all three parts rather than just the two parts in a regular inequality.
