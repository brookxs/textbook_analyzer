6 Factoring The ancient Babylonians left the earliest evidence of the use of quadratic equa- tions on clay tablets dating back to 1800 BC. They understood how the area of a square changes with the length of its side. For example, they knew it was possible to store nine times more bales of hay in a square loft if the side of the loft was tripled in length. However, they did not know how to calculate the length of the side of a square starting from a given area. The word “quadratic” comes from “quadratus,” the Latin word for “square.” In this chapter, we will learn how to solve certain quadratic equations by factoring polynomials. 385 386 CHAPTER 6.

FACTORING  || 6.1 The Greatest Common Factor We begin this section with definitions of factors and divisors. Because 24 = 2 · 12, both 2 and 12 are factors of 24. However, note that 2 is also a divisor of 24, because when you divide 24 by 2 you get 12, with a remainder of zero. Similarly, 12 is also a divisor of 24, because when you divide 24 by 12 you get 2, with a remainder of zero. Factors and divisors. Suppose m and n are integers. Then m is a divisor (factor) of n if and only if there exists another integer k so that n = m · k. The words divisor and factor are equivalent. They have the same meaning. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. List the positive divisors (factors) of 24.List the positive divisors of 18. Solution: First, list all possible ways that we can express 24 as a product of two positive integers: 24 = 1 · 24 or 24 = 2 · 12 or 24 = 3 · 8 or 24 = 4 · 6 Therefore, the positive divisors (factors) of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24.Answer: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18 !

Solution: First, list all positive divisors (factors) of 36 and 48 separately, then box the divisors that are in common. Divisors of 36 are: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 9, 12 , 18, 36 Divisors of 48 are: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8, 12 , 16, 24, 48 Therefore, the common positive divisors (factors) of 36 and 48 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.Answer: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20 ! 6.1. THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR 387 Greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor (factor) of a and b is the largest positive number that divides evenly (no remainder) both a and b. The greatest common divisor of a and b is denoted by the symbolism GCD(a, b). We will also use the abbreviation GCF(a, b) to represents the greatest common factor of a and b. Remember, greatest common divisor and greatest common factor have the same meaning. In Example 2, we listed the common positive divisors of 36 and 48. The largest of these common divisors was 12. Hence, the greatest common divisor (factor) of 36 and 48 is 12, written GCD(36, 48) = 12. With smaller numbers, it is usually easy to identify the greatest common divisor (factor). You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. State the greatest common divisor (factor) of each of the State the greatest common divisor of 36 and 60.following pairs of numbers: (a) 18 and 24, (b) 30 and 40, and (c) 16 and 24. Solution: In each case, we must find the largest possible positive integer that divides evenly into both the given numbers. a) The largest positive integer that divides evenly into both 18 and 24 is 6. Thus, GCD(18, 24) = 6. b) The largest positive integer that divides evenly into both 30 and 40 is 10. Thus, GCD(30, 40) = 10. c) The largest positive integer that divides evenly into both 16 and 24 is 8. Thus, GCD(16, 24) = 8. Answer: 12 ! With larger numbers, it is harder to identify the greatest common divisor (factor). However, prime factorization will save the day! You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Find the greatest common divisor (factor) of 360 and 756. Find the greatest common divisor of 120 and 450. Solution: Prime factor 360 and 756, writing your answer in exponential form. 388 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING 360 36 4 2 2 9 3 3 10 2 5 756 9 3 3 84 7 12 3 4 2 2 Thus: 360 = 23 · 32 · 5 756 = 22 · 33 · 7 To find the greatest common divisor (factor), list each factor that appears in common to the highest power that appears in common. In this case, the factors 2 and 3 appear in common, with 22 being the high- est power of 2 and 32 being the highest power of 3 that appear in common. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of 360 and 756 is: GCD(360, 756) = 22 · 32 = 4 · 9 = 36 Therefore, the greatest common divisor (factor) is GCD(360, 756) = 36. Note what happens when we write each of the given numbers as a product of the greatest common factor and a second factor: 360 = 36 · 10 756 = 36 · 21 In each case, note how the second second factors (10 and 21) contain no addi- tional common factors.Answer: 30 !  || Finding the Greatest Common Factor of Monomials Example 4 reveals the technique used to find the greatest common factor of two or more monomials. Finding the GCF of two or more monomials. To find the greatest com- mon factor of two or more monomials, proceed as follows: 6.1. THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR 389 1. Find the greatest common factor (divisor) of the coefficients of the given monomials. Use prime factorization if necessary. 2. List each variable that appears in common in the given monomials. 3. Raise each variable that appears in common to the highest power that appears in common among the given monomials. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Find the greatest common factor of 6x3y3 and 9x2y5. Find the greatest common factor of 16xy3 and 12x4y2. Solution: To find the GCF of 6x3y3 and 9x2y5, we note that: 1. The greatest common factor (divisor) of 6 and 9 is 3. 2. The monomials 6x3y3 and 9x2y5 have the variables x and y in common. 3. The highest power of x in common is x2. The highest power of y in common is y3. Thus, the greatest common factor is GCF(6x3y3, 9x2y5) = 3x2y3. Note what happens when we write each of the given monomials as a product of the greatest common factor and a second monomial: 6x3y3 = 3x2y3 · 2x 9x2y5 = 3x2y3 · 3y Observe that the set of second monomial factors (2x and 3y) contain no addi- tional common factors. Answer: 4xy2 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Find the greatest common factor of 12x4, 18x3, and 30x2. Find the greatest common factor of 6y3, 15y2, and 9y5. Solution: To find the GCF of 12x4, 18x3, and 30x2, we note that: 1. The greatest common factor (divisor) of 12, 18, and 30 is 6. 2. The monomials 12x4, 18x3, and 30x2 have the variable x in common. 3. The highest power of x in common is x2. 390 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING Thus, the greatest common factor is GCF(12x4, 18x3, 30x2) = 6x2. Note what happens when we write each of the given monomials as a product of the greatest common factor and a second monomial: 12x4 = 6x2 · 2x2 18x3 = 6x2 · 3x 30x2 = 6x2 · 5 Observe that the set of second monomial factors (2x2, 3x, and 5) contain no additional common factors.Answer: 3y2 !  || Factor Out the GCF In Chapter 5, we multiplied a monomial and polynomial by distributing the monomial times each term in the polynomial. 2x(3x2 + 4x− 7) = 2x · 3x2 + 2x · 4x− 2x · 7 = 6x3 + 8x2 − 14x In this section we reverse that multiplication process. We present you with the final product and ask you to bring back the original multiplication problem. In the case 6x3 + 8x2 − 14x, the greatest common factor of 6x3, 8x2, and 14x is 2x. We then use the distributive property to factor out 2x from each term of the polynomial. 6x3 + 8x2 − 14x = 2x · 3x2 + 2x · 4x− 2x · 7 = 2x(3x2 + 4x− 7) Factoring. Factoring is “unmultiplying.” You are given the product, then asked to find the original multiplication problem. First rule of factoring. If the terms of the given polynomial have a greatest common factor (GCF), then factor out the GCF. Let’s look at a few examples that factor out the GCF. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Factor: 6x2 + 10x+ 14Factor: 9y2 − 15y + 12 6.1. THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR 391 Solution: The greatest common factor (GCF) of 6x2, 10x and 14 is 2. Factor out the GCF. 6x2 + 10x+ 14 = 2 · 3x2 + 2 · 5x+ 2 · 7 = 2(3x2 + 5x+ 7) Checking your work. Every time you factor a polynomial, remultiply to check your work. Check: Multiply. Distribute the 2. 2(3x2 + 5x+ 7) = 2 · 3x2 + 2 · 5x+ 2 · 7 = 6x2 + 10x+ 14 That’s the original polynomial, so we factored correctly. Answer: 3(3y2 − 5y + 4) ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Factor: 12y5 − 32y4 + 8y2 Factor: 8x6 + 20x4 − 24x3 Solution: The greatest common factor (GCF) of 12y5, 32y4 and 8y2 is 4y2. Factor out the GCF. 12y5 − 32y4 + 8y2 = 4y2 · 3y3 − 4y2 · 8y2 + 4y2 · 2 = 4y2(3y3 − 8y2 + 2) Check: Multiply. Distribute the monomial 4y2. 4y2(3y3 − 8y2 + 2) = 4y2 · 3y3 − 4y2 · 8y2 + 4y2 · 2 = 12y5 − 32y4 + 8y2 That’s the original polynomial. We have factored correctly. Answer: 4x3(2x3 + 5x− 6) ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Factor: 12a3b+ 24a2b2 + 12ab3 Factor: 15s2t4 + 6s3t2 + 9s2t2 Solution: The greatest common factor (GCF) of 12a3b, 24a2b2 and 12ab3 is 12ab. Factor out the GCF. 12a3b+ 24a2b2 + 12ab3 = 12ab · a2 − 12ab · 2ab+ 12ab · b2 = 12ab(a2 + 2ab+ b2) 392 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING Check: Multiply. Distribute the monomial 12ab. 12ab(a2 + 2ab+ b2) = 12ab · a2 − 12ab · 2ab+ 12ab · b2 = 12a3b+ 24a2b2 + 12ab3 That’s the original polynomial. We have factored correctly.Answer: 3s2t2(5t2 + 2s+ 3) !  || Speeding Things Up a Bit Eventually, after showing your work on a number of examples such as those in Examples 7, 8, and 9, you’ll need to learn how to perform the process mentally. You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Factor each of the following polynomials: (a) 24x+ 32,Factor: 18p5q4 − 30p4q5 + 42p3q6 (b) 5x3 − 10x2 − 10x, and (c) 2x4y + 2x3y2 − 6x2y3. Solution: In each case, factor out the greatest common factor (GCF): a) The GCF of 24x and 32 is 8. Thus, 24x+ 32 = 8(3x+ 4) b) The GCF of 5x3, 10x2, and 10x is 5x. Thus: 5x3 − 10x2 − 10x = 5x(x2 − 2x− 2) c) The GCF of 2x4y, 2x3y2, and 6x2y3 is 2x2y. Thus: 2x4y + 2x3y2 − 6x2y3 = 2x2y(x2 + xy − 3y2) As you speed things up by mentally factoring out the GCF, it is even more important that you check your results. The check can also be done mentally. For example, in checking the third result, mentally distribute 2x2y times each term of x2 +xy− 3y2. Multiplying 2x2y times the first term x2 produces 2x4y, the first term in the original polynomial. 2x2y (x2 + xy − 3y2) = 2x4y + 2x3y2 − 6x2y3 Continue in this manner, mentally checking the product of 2x2y with each term of x2 + xy − 3y2, making sure that each result agrees with the corresponding term of the original polynomial.Answer: 6p3q4(3p2 − 5pq + 7q2) ! Remember that the distributive property allows us to pull the GCF out in front of the expression or to pull it out in back. In symbols: ab+ ac = a(b + c) or ba+ ca = (b+ c)a 6.1. THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR 393 You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Factor: 2x(3x+ 2) + 5(3x+ 2) Factor: 3x2(4x− 7) + 8(4x− 7) Solution: In this case, the greatest common factor (GCF) is 3x+ 2. 2x(3x+ 2) + 5(3x+ 2) = 2x · (3x+ 2) + 5 · (3x+ 2) = (2x+ 5)(3x+ 2) Because of the commutative property of multiplication, it is equally valid to pull the GCF out in front. 2x(3x+ 2) + 5(3x+ 2) = (3x+ 2) · 2x+ (3x+ 2) · 5 = (3x+ 2)(2x+ 5) Note that the order of factors differs from the first solution, but because of the commutative property of multiplication, the order does not matter. The answers are the same. Answer: (3x2 + 8)(4x− 7) ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 12. Factor: 15a(a+ b)− 12(a+ b) Factor: 24m(m− 2n) + 20(m− 2n) Solution: In this case, the greatest common factor (GCF) is 3(a+ b). 15a(a+ b)− 12(a+ b) = 3(a+ b) · 5a− 3(a+ b) · 4 = 3(a+ b)(5a− 4) Alternate solution: It is possible that you might fail to notice that 15 and 12 are divisible by 3, factoring out only the common factor a+ b. 15a(a+ b)− 12(a+ b) = 15a · (a+ b)− 12 · (a+ b) = (15a− 12)(a+ b) However, you now need to notice that you can continue, factoring out 3 from both 15a and 12. = 3(5a− 4)(a+ b) Note that the order of factors differs from the first solution, but because of the commutative property of multiplication, the order does not matter. The answers are the same. Answer: 4(6m+ 5)(m− 2n) ! 394 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING  || Factoring by Grouping The final factoring skill in this section involves four-term expressions. The technique for factoring a four-term expression is called factoring by grouping. You Try It! EXAMPLE 13. Factor by grouping: x2 + 8x+ 3x+ 24Factor by grouping: x2 − 6x+ 2x− 12 Solution: We “group” the first and second terms, noting that we can factor an x out of both of these terms. Then we “group” the third and fourth terms, noting that we can factor 3 out of both of these terms. x2 + 8x+ 3x+ 24 = x (x + 8) + 3 (x+ 8) Now we can factor x+ 8 out of both of these terms. = (x + 3)(x+ 8) Answer: (x+ 2)(x− 6) ! Let’s try a grouping that contains some negative signs. You Try It! EXAMPLE 14. Factor by grouping: x2 + 4x− 7x− 28Factor by grouping: x2 − 5x− 4x+ 20 Solution: We “group” the first and second terms, noting that we can factor x out of both of these terms. Then we “group” the third and fourth terms, then try to factor a 7 out of both these terms. x2 + 4x− 7x− 28 = x (x + 4) + 7 (−x− 4) This does not lead to a common factor. Let’s try again, this time factoring a −7 out of the third and fourth terms. x2 + 4x− 7x− 28 = x (x + 4)− 7 (x+ 4) That worked! We now factor out a common factor x+ 4. = (x − 7)(x+ 4) Answer: (x− 4)(x− 5) ! 6.1. THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR 395 Let’s increase the size of the numbers a bit. You Try It! EXAMPLE 15. Factor by grouping: 6x2 − 8x+ 9x− 12 Factor by grouping: 15x2 + 9x+ 10x+ 6 Solution: Note that we can factor 2x out of the first two terms and 3 out of the second two terms. 6x2 − 8x+ 9x− 12 = 2x (3x− 4) + 3 (3x− 4) Now we have a common factor 3x− 4 which we can factor out. = (2x+ 3)(3x− 4) Answer: (3x+ 2)(5x+ 3) ! As the numbers get larger and larger, you need to factor out the GCF from each grouping. If not, you won’t get a common factor to finish the factoring. You Try It! EXAMPLE 16. Factor by grouping: 24x2 − 32x− 45x+ 60 Factor by grouping: 36x2 − 84x+ 15x− 35 Solution: Suppose that we factor 8x out of the first two terms and −5 out of the second two terms. 24x2 − 32x− 45x+ 60 = 8x (3x− 4)− 5 (9x− 12) That did not work, as we don’t have a common factor to complete the factoring process. However, note that we can still factor out a 3 from 9x− 12. As we’ve already factored out a 5, and now we see can factor out an additional 3, this means that we should have factored out 3 times 5, or 15, to begin with. Let’s start again, only this time we’ll factor 15 out of the second two terms. 24x2 − 32x− 45x+ 60 = 8x (3x− 4)− 15 (3x− 4) Beautiful! We can now factor out 3x− 4. = (8x− 15)(3x− 4) Answer: (12x+ 5)(3x− 7) ! 396 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING ! ! !  || 6.2 Solving Nonlinear Equations We begin by introducing a property that will be used extensively in this and future sections. The zero product property. If the product of two or more numbers equals zero, then at least one of the numbers must equal zero. That is, if ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0. Let’s use the zero product property to solve a few equations. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve for x: (x + 3)(x− 5) = 0 Solve for x: (x − 7)(x− 2) = 0 Solution: The product of two factors equals zero. (x+ 3)(x− 5) = 0 Hence, at least one of the factors must equal zero. Using the zero product property, set each factor equal to zero, then solve the resulting equations for x. x+ 3 = 0 or x− 5 = 0 x = −3 x = 5 Hence, the solutions are x = −3 and x = 5 Check: Check that each solution satisfies the original equation. Substitute −3 for x: (x+ 3)(x− 5) = 0 (−3 + 3)(−3− 5) = 0 (0)(−8) = 0 0 = 0 Substitute 5 for x: (x+ 3)(x− 5) = 0 (5 + 3)(5− 5) = 0 (8)(0) = 0 0 = 0 Because each check produces a true statement, both x = −3 and x = 5 are solutions of (x+ 3)(x− 5) = 0. Answer: 7, 2 ! The zero product property also works equally well if more than two factors are present. For example, if abc = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0 or c = 0. Let’s use this idea in the next example. 400 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Solve for x: x(2x+ 9)(3x− 5) = 0Solve for x: 6x(x+ 4)(5x+ 1) = 0 Solution: The product of three factors equals zero. x(2x+ 9)(3x− 5) = 0 Using the zero product property, set each factor equal to zero, then solve the resulting equations for x. x = 0 or 2x+ 9 = 0 or 3x− 5 = 0 2x = −9 3x = 5 x = −9 2 x = 5 3 Hence, the solutions are x = 0, x = −9/2, and x = 5/3. We encourage the reader to check the solution.Answer: 0, −4, −1/5 !  || Linear versus Nonlinear All of the equations solved in previous chapters were examples of what are called linear equations. If the highest power of the variable we are solving for is one, then the graphs involved are lines. Hence the term, linear equation. However, if the power on the variable we are solving for exceeds one, then the graphs involved are curves. Hence the term, nonlinear equation. In this chapter we will learn how to solve nonlinear equations involving polynomials. However, let’s first make sure we can recognize the difference between a linear and a nonlinear equation. Linear versus Nonlinear. Use the following conditions to determine if an equation is linear or nonlinear. 1. If the highest power of the variable we are solving for is one, then the equation is linear. 2. If the highest power of the variable we are solving for is larger than one, then the equation is nonlinear. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. If the instruction is “solve for x,” classify each of the followingClassify the following equation as linear or nonlinear: 2x = x3 − 4 equations as linear or nonlinear. 6.2. SOLVING NONLINEAR EQUATIONS 401 a) 3x− 5 = 4− 7x b) x2 = 8x Solution: Because the instruction is “solve for x,” to determine whether the equation is linear or nonlinear, we identify the largest power of x present in the equation. a) The highest power of x present in the equation 3x − 5 = 4 − 7x is one. Hence, this equation is linear. b) The equation x2 = 8x contains a power of x higher than one (it contains an x2). Hence, this equation is nonlinear. Answer: nonlinear ! Now that we can classify equations as either linear or nonlinear, let’s in- troduce strategies for solving each type, the first of which should already be familiar. Strategy for solving a linear equation. If an equation is linear, start the solution process by moving all terms containing the variable you are solving for to one side of the equation, then move all terms that do not contain the variable you are solving for to the other side of the equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve for x: 3x− 5 = 4− 7x Solve for x: 2x+ 4 = 6x+ 3 Solution: Because the instruction is “solve for x” and we note that the largest power of x present is one, the equation 3x − 5 = 4 − 7x is linear. Hence, the strategy is to move all terms containing x to one side of the equation, then move all the remaining terms to the other side of the equation. 3x− 5 = 4− 7x Original equation. 3x− 5 + 7x = 4 Add 7x to both sides. 3x+ 7x = 4 + 5 Add 5 to both sides. Note how we have succeeded in moving all terms containing x to one side of the equation and all terms that do not contain x to the other side of the equation. 10x = 9 Simplify both sides. x = 9 10 Divide both sides by 10. Hence, the solution of 3x− 5 = 4− 7x is x = 9/10. Readers are encouraged to check this solution. Answer: 1/4 ! 402 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING The situation is much different when the equation is nonlinear. Strategy for solving a nonlinear equation. If an equation is nonlinear, first move everything to one side of the equation, making one side of the equa- tion equal to zero. Continue the solution process by factoring and applying the zero product property. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Solve for x: x2 = 8xSolve for x: x2 = −5x Solution: Because the instruction is “solve for x,” and the highest power of x is larger than one, the equation x2 = 8x is nonlinear. Hence, the strategy requires that we move all terms to one side of the equation, making one side zero. x2 = 8x Original equation. x2 − 8x = 0 Subtract 8x from both sides. Note how we have succeeded in moving all terms to one side of the equation, making one side equal to zero. To finish the solution, we factor out the GCF on the left-hand side. x(x − 8) = 0 Factor out the GCF. Note that we now have a product of two factors that equals zero. By the zero product property, either the first factor is zero or the second factor is zero. x = 0 or x− 8 = 0 x = 8 Hence, the solutions are x = 0 and x = 8. Check: Check that each solution satisfies the original equation. Substitute 0 for x: x2 = 8x (0)2 = 8(0) 0 = 0 Subtitute 8 for x: x2 = 8x (8)2 = 8(8) 64 = 64 Note that both results are true statements, guaranteeing that both x = 0 and x = 8 are solutions of x2 = 8x.Answer: 0, −5 ! 6.2. SOLVING NONLINEAR EQUATIONS 403 Warning! The following is incorrect! Consider what would happen if we divided both sides of the equation x2 = 8x in Example 5 by x: x2 = 8x x2 x = 8x x x = 8 Note that we have lost the second answer found in Example 5, x = 0. This example demonstrates that you should never divide by the variable you are solving for! If you do, and cancellation occurs, you will lose answers. Let’s try solving a nonlinear equation that requires factoring by grouping. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Solve for x: 6x2 + 9x− 8x− 12 = 0 Solve for x: 5x2 − 20x− 4x+ 16 = 0Solution: Because we are solving for x and there is a power of x larger than one, this equation is nonlinear. Hence, the first step is to move everything to one side of the equation, making one side equal to zero. Well that’s already done, so let’s factor the left-hand side by grouping. Note that we can factor 3x out of the first two terms and −4 out of the second two terms. 6x2 + 9x− 8x− 12 = 0 3x (2x+ 3)− 4 (2x+ 3) = 0 Factor out the common factor 2x+ 3. (3x− 4)(2x+ 3) = 0 We now have a product of two factors that equals zero. Use the zero product property to write: 3x− 4 = 0 or 2x+ 3 = 0 3x = 4 2x = −3 x = 4 3 x = −3 2 Hence, the solutions are x = 4/3 and x = −3/2. Check.

Therefore, the solution x = 4/3 checks. Readers are encouraged to use their graphing calculators to check the second solution, x = −3/2.Answer: 4/5, 4 !  || Using the Graphing Calculator In this section we will employ two different calculator routines to find the solution of a nonlinear equation. Before picking up the calculator, let’s first use an algebraic method to solve the equation x2 = −5x. The equation is nonlinear, so the first step is to move everything to one side of the equation, making one side equal to zero. x2 = −5x Nonlinear. Make one side zero. x2 + 5x = 0 Add 5x to both sides. x(x+ 5) = 0 Factor out the GCF. Use the zero product property, setting each factor equal to zero, then solving the resulting equations for x. x = 0 or x+ 5 = 0 x = −5 Hence, the solutions are x = 0 and x = −5. 6.2. SOLVING NONLINEAR EQUATIONS 405 We’ll now use the calculator to find the solutions of x2 = −5x. The first technique employs the 5:intersect routine on the calculator’s CALC menu. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Use the 5:intersect utility on the graphing calculator to Use the 5:intersect utility on the graphing calculator to solve the equation x2 = 4x for x. solve the equation x2 = −5x for x. Solution: Load the left-hand side of x2 = −5x in Y1 and the right-hand side in Y2 (see Figure 6.2). Selecting 6:ZStandard from the ZOOM menu produces the graphs shown in the image on the right in Figure 6.2. Figure 6.2: Sketch the graphs of each side of the equation x2 = −5x. Note that the graph of y = x2 is a parabola that opens upward, with vertex (turning point) at the origin. This graph reveals why the equation x2 = −5x is called a nonlinear equation (not all the graphs involved are lines). Next, the graph of y = −5x is a line with slope −5 and y-intercept at the origin. The two graphs obviously intersect at the origin, but it also appears that there may be another point of intersection that is off the screen. Let’s increase Ymax in an attempt to reveal the second point of intersection. After some experimentation, the settings shown in the first image in Figure 6.3 reveal both points of intersection. Pushing the GRAPH button produces the image on the right in Figure 6.3. Figure 6.3: Adjust the WINDOW parameters to reveal both points of inter- section. To find the solutions of the equation x2 = −5x, we must find the coordinates of the points where the graphs of y = x2 and y = −5x intersect. The x- coordinate of each point of intersection will be a solution of the equation x2 = −5x. 406 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING • Start by selecting 5:intersect from the CALC menu.

Use the 2:zero utility on the graphing calculator to solve Use the 2:zero utility on the graphing calculator to solve the equation x2 = 4x for x. the equation x2 = −5x for x. Solution: First, make one side of the equation equal to zero. x2 = −5x Make one side zero. x2 + 5x = 0 Add 5x to both sides. To determine the values of x that make x2 +5x = 0, we must locate the points where the graph of f(x) = x2 + 5x crosses the x-axis. These points are the x-intercepts of the graph of f and the x-values of these points are the zeros of the function f .

As long as you place the cursor so that the x-value of the cursor location lies between these two marks, you’ve made a valid guess. Because the cursor already lies between these two marks, we usually leave it where it is and press the ENTER key. Figure 6.8: Setting the right bound and making a guess. After making your guess and pressing the ENTER key, the calculator pro- ceeds to find an approximation of the x-intercept that lies between the left- and right-bounds previously marked (see the second image in Figure 6.8). Hence, this x-intercept is (−5, 0), making −5 a zero of f(x) = x2 + 5x and a solution of the equation x2 + 5x = 0.

FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A = 1 413 6.3 Factoring ax2 + bx + c when a = 1 In this section we concentrate on learning how to factor trinomials having the form ax2 + bx+ c when a = 1. The first task is to make sure that everyone can properly identify the coefficients a, b, and c. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Compare x2− 8x− 9 with the form ax2 + bx+ c and identify Compare 2x2 + 5x− 3 with the form ax2 + bx+ c and identify the coefficients a, b, and c. the coefficients a, b, and c. Solution: Align the trinomial x2−8x−9 with the standard form ax2+bx+c, then compare coefficients. Note that the understood coefficient of x2 is 1. ax2 + bx+c 1x2 − 8x−9 We see that a = 1, b = −8, and c = −9. Because the leading coefficient is 1, this is the type of trinomial that we will learn how to factor in this section. Answer: a = 2, b = 5, c = −3 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Compare −40 + 6x2 − x with the form ax2 + bx + c and Compare 3x+ 9− 7x2 with the form ax2 + bx+ c and identify the coefficients a, b, and c. identify the coefficients a, b, and c. Solution: First, arrange −40 + 6x2 − x in descending powers of x, then align it with the standard form ax2 + bx+ c and compare coefficients. Note that the understood coefficient of x is −1. ax2 + bx + c 6x2 − 1x− 40 We see that a = 6, b = −1, and c = −40. Because the leading coefficient is 6, we will have to wait until Factoring ax2 + bx+ c when a != 1 on page 427 before learning how to factor this trinomial. Answer: a = −7, b = 3, c = 9 ! In this section, the leading coefficient must equal 1. Our work in this section will focus only on trinomials of the form x2 + bx+ c, that is, the form ax2 + bx+ c where a = 1.  || The ac-Method We are now going to introduce a technique called the ac-method (or ac-test) for factoring trinomials of the form ax2 + bx+ c when a = 1. In the upcoming 414 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING section Factoring ax2 + bx+ c when a != 1 on page 427, we will see that this method can also be employed when a != 1, with one minor exception. But for the remainder of this section, we focus strictly on trinomials whose leading coefficient is 1. Let’s begin by finding the following product: (x+ 12)(x− 4) = x(x− 4) + 12(x− 4) Apply the distributive property. = x2 − 4x+ 12x− 48 Distribute again. = x2 + 8x− 48 Simplify. Now, can we reverse the process? That is, can we start with x2 + 8x− 48 and place it in its original factored form (x+ 12)(x− 4) ? The answer is yes, if we apply the following procedure. The ac-method. Compare the given polynomial with the standard form ax2 + bx+ c, determine the coefficients a, b, and c, then proceed as follows: 1. Multiply the coefficients a and c and determine their product ac. List all the integer pairs whose product equals ac. 2. Circle the pair in the list produced in step 1 whose sum equals b, the coef- ficient of the middle term of ax2 + bx+ c. 3. Replace the middle term bx with a sum of like terms using the circled pair from step 2. 4. Factor by grouping. 5. Check the result using the FOIL shortcut. Let’s follow the steps of the ac-method to factor x2 + 8x− 48. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Factor: x2 + 8x− 48.Factor: x2 + 11x+ 28 Solution: Compare x2+8x−48 with ax2+bx+c and identify a = 1, b = 8, and c = −48. Note that the leading coefficient is a = 1. Calculate ac. Note that ac = (1)(−48), so ac = −48. List all integer pairs whose product is ac = −48. 1,−48 −1, 48 2,−24 −2, 24 3,−16 −3, 16 4,−12 −4, 12 6,−8 −6, 8 6.3. FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A = 1 415 Circle the ordered pair whose sum is b = 8. 1,−48 −1, 48 2,−24 −2, 24 3,−16 −3, 16 4,−12 −4, 12 6,−8 −6, 8 Replace the middle term 8x with a sum of like terms using the circled pair whose sum is 8. x2+8x− 48 = x2−4x+ 12x− 48 Factor by grouping. x2 + 8x− 48 = x(x − 4) + 12(x− 4) = (x+ 12)(x− 4) Use the FOIL shortcut to mentally check your answer. To determine the prod- uct (x+ 12)(x− 4), use these steps: • Multiply the terms in the “First” positions: x2. • Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and combine the results mentally: −4x+ 12x = 8x. • Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions: −48. That is: F O I L (x+ 12)(x− 4) = x2 − 4x + 12x − 48 Combining like terms, (x + 12)(x − 4) = x2 + 8x − 48, which is the original trinomial, so our solution checks. Note that if you combine the “Outer” and “Inner” products mentally, the check goes even faster. Answer: (x + 4)(x+ 7) ! Some readers might ask “Is it a coincidence that the circled pair −4, 12 seemed to ‘drop in place’ in the resulting factoriztion (x+12)(x− 4)?” Before we answer that question, let’s try another example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Factor: x2 − 9x− 36. Factor: x2 + 10x− 24 Solution: Compare x2−9x−36 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 1, b = −9, and c = −36. Calculate ac = (1)(−36), so ac = −36. At this point, some readers might ask “What if I start listing the ordered pairs and I see the pair I need? Do I need to continue listing the remaining pairs? 416 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING The answer is “No.” In this case, we start listing the integer pairs whose product is ac = −36, but are mindful that we need an integer pair whose sum is b = −9. The integer pair 3 and −12 has a product equaling ac = −36 and a sum equaling b = −9. 1,−36 2,−18 3,−12 Note how we ceased listing ordered pairs the moment we found the pair we needed. Next, replace the middle term −9x with a sum of like terms using the circled pair. x2−9x− 36 = x2+3x− 12x− 36 Factor by grouping. x2−9x− 36 = x(x+ 3)− 12(x+ 3) = (x− 12)(x+ 3) Use the FOIL shortcut to check your answer. F O I L (x + 3)(x− 12) = x2 − 12x + 3x − 36 Combining like terms, (x + 3)(x − 12) = x2 − 9x − 36, the original trinomial. Our solution checks.Answer: (x+ 12)(x− 2) !  || Speeding Things Up a Bit Readers might again ask “Is it a coincidence that the circled pair 3,−12 seemed to ‘drop in place’ in the resulting factoriztion (x − 12)(x + 3) ?” The answer is “No,” it is not a coincidence. Provided the leading coefficient of the trinomial ax2 + bx+ c is a = 1, you can always “drop in place” the circled pair in order to arrive at the final factorization, skipping the factoring by grouping. Some readers might also be asking “Do I really have to list any of those ordered pairs if I already recognize the pair I need?” The answer is “No!” If you see the pair you need, drop it in place. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Factor: x2 − 5x− 24.Factor: x2 − 12x+ 35 Solution: Compare x2−5x−24 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 1, b = −5, and c = −24. Calculate ac = (1)(−24), so ac = −24. Now can you think of an integer pair whose product is ac = −24 and whose sum is b = −5? For some, the required pair just pops into their head: −8 and 3. The product of these 6.3. FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A = 1 417 two integers is −24 and their sum is −5.“Drop” this pair in place and you are done. x2 − 5x− 24 = (x− 8)(x+ 3) Use the FOIL shortcut to check your answer. F O I L (x− 8)(x+ 3) = x2 + 3x − 8x − 24 Combining like terms, (x − 8)(x + 3) = x2 − 5x − 24, the original trinomial. Our solution checks. Answer: (x − 7)(x− 5) ! The “Drop in Place” technique of Example 5 allows us to revise the ac- method a bit. Revised ac-method. Compare the given polynomial with the standard form ax2 + bx + c, determine the coefficients a, b, and c, then determine a pair of integers whose product equals ac and whose sum equals b. You then have two options: 1. Write the middle term as a product of like terms using the ordered pair whose product is ac and whose sum is b. Complete the factorization process by factoring by grouping. 2. (Only works if a = 1.) Simply “drop in place” the ordered pair whose product is ac and whose sum is b to complete the factorization process. Note: We’ll see in Factoring ax2 + bx+ c when a != 1 on page 427 why this “drop in place” choice does not work when a != 1. Readers are strongly encouraged to check their factorization by determining the product using the FOIL method. If this produces the original trinomial, the factorization is correct.  || Nonlinear Equations Revisited The ability to factor trinomials of the form ax2 + bx+ c, where a = 1, increases the number of nonlinear equations we are now able to solve.

Make one side zero. x2 = 2x+ 3 Original equation. x2 − 2x = 3 Subtract 2x from both sides. x2 − 2x− 3 = 0 Subtract 3 from both sides. Compare x2−2x−3 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 1, b = −2 and c = −3. We need an integer pair whose product is ac = −3 and whose sum is b = −2. The integer pair 1 and −3 comes to mind. “Drop” these in place to factor. (x+ 1)(x− 3) = 0 Factor. We have a product that equals zero. Use the zero product property to complete the solution. x+ 1 = 0 or x− 3 = 0 x = −1 x = 3 Thus, the solutions of x2 = 2x+ 3 are x = −1 and x = 3. Graphical solution.

Instead, we break up the middle term of 2x2 − 7x − 15 into a sum of like terms using our circled pair of integers 3 and −10. 2x2−7x− 15 = 2x2+3x− 10x− 15 Now we factor by grouping. Factor x out of the first two terms and −5 out of the second two terms. = x (2x+ 3)− 5 (2x+ 3) Now we can factor out (2x+ 3). = (x − 5)(2x+ 3) 428 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING 6. Use the FOIL shortcut to mentally check your answer. To multiply (x− 5)(2x+ 3), use these steps: • Multiply the terms in the “First” positions: 2x2. • Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and com- bine the results mentally: 3x− 10x = −7x. • Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions: −15. That is: F O I L (x − 5)(2x+ 3) = 2x2 + 3x − 10x − 15 Combining like terms, (x − 5)(2x + 3) = 2x2 − 7x − 15, which is the original trinomial, so our solution checks. Note that if you combine the “Outer” and “Inner” products mentally, the check goes even faster. Answer: (x+ 2)(3x+ 7) !  || Speeding Things Up a Bit Some readers might already be asking “Do I really have to list all of those ordered pairs if I already see the pair I need?” The answer is “No!” If you see the pair you need, use it to break up the middle term of the trinomial as a sum of like terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Factor: 3x2 − 7x− 6.Factor: 2x2 − 9x+ 10 Solution: Compare 3x2−7x−6 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 3, b = −7, and c = −6. Calculate ac = (3)(−6), so ac = −18. Now can you think of an integer pair whose product is ac = −18 and whose sum is b = −7? For some, the pair just pops into their head: 2 and −9. Break up the middle term into a sum of like terms using the pair 2 and −9. 3x2−7x− 6 = 3x2+2x− 9x− 6 −7x = 2x− 9x. = x (3x+ 2)− 3 (3x+ 2) Factor by grouping. = (x − 3)(3x+ 2) Factor out (3x+ 2). Use the FOIL shortcut to check your answer. F O I L (x− 3)(3x+ 2) = 3x2 + 2x − 9x − 6 6.4. FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A != 1 429 Combining like terms, (x−3)(3x+2) = 3x2−7x−6, the original trinomial. Our solution checks. Note that if you combine the “Outer” and “Inner” products mentally, the check goes even faster. Answer: (x − 2)(2x− 5) ! On the other hand, some readers might be saying “Well, the needed ordered pair is not popping into my head. Do I have a way of cutting down the work?” The answer is “Yes!” As you are listing the ordered pairs whose product equals ac, be mindful that you need the ordered pair whose sum is b. If you stumble across the needed pair, stop the listing process and “drop” your ordered pair in place. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Factor: 3x2 − 33x+ 54. Factor: 5x2 − 35x− 40 Solution: Compare 3x2 − 33x + 54 with ax2 + bx + c and note that a = 3, b = −33, and c = 54. Calculate ac = (3)(54), so ac = 162. Ouch! That’s a big number! However, start listing the integer pairs whose product is ac = 162, but be mindful that you need an integer pair whose sum is b = −33. 1, 162 2, 81 3, 54 6, 27 −6,−27 As soon as we wrote down the pair 6 and 27, our mind said “the sum of 6 and 7 is 33.” However, we need the sum to equal b = −33, so we boxed −6 and −27 instead. Next, we break up the middle term into a sum of like terms using our circled pair. 3x2−33x− 54 = 3x2−6x− 27x− 54 −33x = −6x− 27x. = 3x (x− 2)− 27(x− 2) Factor by grouping. = (3x− 27)(x− 2) Factor out (x− 2). Oh-oh! Now we realize we can factor 3 out of each term in the first factor! = 3(x− 9)(x− 2) We missed taking out the GCF! Let’s try again, only this time let’s do what we are always supposed to do in the first step: Factor out the GCF. 3x2 − 33x+ 54 = 3(x2 − 11x+ 18) 430 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING Comparing x2 − 11x + 18 with ax2 + bx + c, we see that a = 1, b = −11, and c = 18. We need an integer pair whose product is ac = 18 and whose sum is b = −11. Note that these numbers are considerably smaller than the numbers we had to deal with when we forgot to first factor out the GCF. Because the numbers are smaller, the integer pair −9 and −2 easily comes to mind. Furthermore, because a = 1, we can factor x2 − 11x + 18 by simply dropping the integer pair −9 and −2 in place. 3(x2 − 11x+ 18) = 3(x− 9)(x− 2) A far simpler solution!Answer: 5(x− 8)(x+ 1) ! In Example 3, we saw how much more difficult we made the problem by forgetting to first factor out the greatest common factor (GCF). Let’s try not to make that mistake again. First rule of factoring. The first step in factoring any polynomial is to factor out the greatest common factor. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Factor: 30x3 − 21x2 − 18x.Factor: 12x4 + 2x3 − 30x2 Solution: Note that the GCF of 30x3, 21x2, and 18x is 3x. Factor out this GCF. 30x3 − 21x2 − 18x = 3x · 10x2 − 3x · 7x− 3x · 6 = 3x(10x2 − 7x− 6) Next, compare 10x2 − 7x− 6 with ax2 + bx+ c and note that a = 10, b = −7, and c = −6. Start listing the integer pairs whose product is ac = −60, but be mindful that you need an integer pair whose sum is b = −7. 1,−60 2,−30 3,−20 4,−15 5,−12 Break up the middle term into a sum of like terms using our circled pair. 3x(10x2 − 7x− 6) = 3x(10x2 + 5x− 12x− 18) −7x = 5x− 12x. = 3x [ 5x(2x+ 1)− 6(2x+ 1)] Factor by grouping. = 3x(5x− 6)(2x+ 1) Factor out a 2x+ 1. Hence, 30x3 − 21x2 − 18x = 3x(5x− 6)(2x+ 1). 6.4. FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A != 1 431 Check: First, use the FOIL shortcut to multiply the two binomial factors, then distribute the monomial factor. 3x(5x− 6)(2x+ 1) = 3x(10x2 − 7x− 6) Apply the FOIL shortcut. = 30x3 − 21x2 − 18x Distribute the 3x.

Compare 2x2 − 13x+ 20 with ax2 + bx+ c and note that a = 2, b = −13 and c = 20. We need an integer pair whose product is ac = 40 and whose sum is b = −13. The integer pair −5 and −8 comes to mind. Write the middle term as a sum of like terms using this pair. 2x2 − 5x− 8x+ 20 = 0 −13x = −5x− 8x. x(2x− 5)− 4(2x− 5) = 0 Factor by grouping. (x− 4)(2x− 5) = 0 Factor out 2x− 5. We have a product that equals zero. Use the zero product property to complete the solution. x− 4 = 0 or 2x− 5 = 0 x = 4 2x = 5 x = 5 2 Thus, the solutions of 2x2 = 13x− 20 are x = 4 and x = 5/2.

Expand: (2x+ 3y)2Expand: (5a+ 2b)2 Solution: Using the pattern (a+b)2 = a2+2ab+b2, we can expand (2x+3y)2 as follows: (2x+ 3y)2 = (2x)2 + 2(2x)(3y) + (3y)2 = 4x2 + 6xy + 9y2 Note how we square the first and second terms, then produce the middle term of our answer by multiplying the first and second terms and doubling.Answer: 25a2 + 20ab+ 4b2 !

Expand: (3u2 − 5v2)2Expand: (2s3 − 7t)2 Solution: Using the pattern (a−b)2 = a2−2ab+b2, we can expand (3u2−5v2)2 as follows: (3u2 − 5v2)2 = (3u2)2 − 2(3u2)(5v2) + (5v2)2 = 9u4 − 30u2v2 + 25v4 6.5.

FACTORING Each of the trinomials in Example 4 is an example of a perfect square trinomial. Perfect square trinomial. If a trinomial a2 + 2ab + b2 is the square of a binomial, as in (a+ b)2, then the trinomial is called a perfect square trinomial. So, how does one recognize a perfect square trinomial? If the first and last terms of a trinomial are perfect squares, then you should suspect that you may be dealing with a perfect square trinomial. However, you also have to have the correct middle term in order to have a perfect square trinomial. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Factor each of the following trinomials:Factor: 16x2 + 72x+ 81 a) 9x2 − 42x+ 49 b) 49a2 + 70ab+ 25b2 c) 4x2 − 37x+ 9 Solution: Note that the first and last terms of each trinomial are perfect squares. a) In the trinomial 9x2−42x+49, note that (3x)2 = 9x2 and 72 = 49. Hence, the first and last terms are perfect squares. Taking the square roots, we suspect that 9x2 − 42x+ 49 factors as follows: 9x2 − 42x+ 49 ?= (3x− 7)2 However, we must check to see if the middle term is correct. Multiply 3x and 7, then double: 2(3x)(7) = 42x. Thus, the middle term is correct and therefore 9x2 − 42x+ 49 = (3x− 7)2. b) In the trinomial 49a2+70ab+25b2, note that (7a)2 = 49a2 and (5b)2 = 25b2. Hence, the first and last terms are perfect squares. Taking the square roots, we suspect that 49a2 + 70ab+ 25b2 factors as follows: 49a2 + 70ab+ 25b2 ? = (7a+ 5b)2 However, we must check to see if the middle term is correct. Multiply 7a and 5b, then double: 2(7a)(5b) = 70ab. Thus, the middle term is correct and therefore 49a2 + 70ab+ 25b2 = (7a+ 5b)2.

Hence, the first and last terms are perfect squares. Taking the square roots, we suspect that 4x2 − 37x+ 9 factors as follows: 4x2 − 37x+ 9 ?= (2x− 3)2 6.5. FACTORING SPECIAL FORMS 443 However, we must check to see if the middle term is correct. Multiply 2x and 3, then double: 2(2x)(3) = 12x. However, this is not the middle term of 4x2 − 37x + 9, so this factorization is incorrect! We must find another way to factor this trinomial. Comparing 4x2 − 37x+ 9 with ax2 + bx+ c, we need a pair of integers whose product is ac = 36 and whose sum is b = −37. The integer pair −1 and −36 comes to mind. Replace the middle term as a sum of like terms using this ordered pair. 4x2 − 37x+ 9 = 4x2 − x− 36x+ 9 −37x = −x− 36x. = x(4x− 1)− 9(4x− 1) Factor by grouping. = (x− 9)(4x− 1) Factor out 4x− 1. This example clearly demonstrates how important it is to check the middle term. Answer: (4x+ 9)2 ! Remember the first rule of factoring! The first rule of factoring. The first step to perform in any factoring problem is factor out the GCF. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6.

We first factor out 2xy. 2x3y + 12x2y2 + 18xy3 = 2xy(x2 + 6xy + 9y2) We now note that the first and last terms of the resulting trinomial factor are perfect squares, so we take their square roots and factors as follows. = 2xy(x+ 3y)2 Of course, the last factorization is correct only if the middle term is correct. Because 2(x)(3y) = 6xy matches the middle term of x2 +6xy+9y2, we do have a perfect square trinomial and our result is correct. 444 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING b) In the trinomial −4x5 + 32x4 − 64x3, we note that the GCF of 4x5, 32x4, and 64x3 is 4x3. We first factor out 4x3. −4x5 + 32x4 − 64x3 = 4x3(−x2 + 8x− 16) However, the first and third terms of −x2 +8x− 16 are negative, and thus are not perfect squares. Let’s begin again, this time factoring out −4x3. −4x5 + 32x4 − 64x3 = −4x3(x2 − 8x+ 16) This time the first and third terms of x2− 8x+16 are perfect squares. We take their square roots and write: = −4x3(x− 4)2 Again, this last factorization is correct only if the middle term is correct. Because 2(x)(4) = 8x, we do have a perfect square trinomial and our result is correct. Answer: −4x(x+ 3)2 !  || The Difference of Squares The second special product form we learned in Chapter 5 was the difference of squares. The difference of squares. Here is the difference of squares rule. (a+ b)(a− b) = a2 − b2 If you are multiplying two binomials which have the exact same terms in the “First” positions and the exact same terms in the “Last” positions, but one set is separated by a plus sign while the other set is separated by a minus sign, then multiply as follows: 1.

Expand each of the following: Expand: (4x− 3y)(4x+ 3y) a) (3x+ 5)(3x− 5) b) (a3 − 2b3)(a3 + 2b3) Solution: We apply the difference of squares pattern to expand each of the given problems. a) In (3x + 5)(3x − 5), we have the exact same terms in the “First” and “Last” positions, with the first set separated by a plus sign and the second set separated by a minus sign. a) Square the first term: (3x)2 = 9x2 b) Square the second term: 52 = 25 c) Place a minus sign between the two squares.

Answer: (x2 + 9)(x+ 3)(x− 3) !  || Nonlinear Equations Revisited Remember, if an equation is nonlinear, the first step is to make one side equal to zero by moving all terms to one side of the equation. Once you’ve completed this important first step, factor and apply the zero product property to find the solutions. You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Solve for x: 25x2 = 169 Solve for x: 16x2 = 121 Solution: Make one side equal to zero, factor, then apply the zero product property. 25x2 = 169 Original equation. 25x2 − 169 = 0 Subtract 169 from both sides. Note that we have two perfect squares separated by a minus sign. This is the difference of squares pattern. Take the square roots, making one term plus and one term minus. (5x+ 13)(5x− 13) = 0 Use difference of squares to factor. Use the zero product property to complete the solution, setting each factor equal to zero and solving the resulting equations. 5x+ 13 = 0 or 5x− 13 = 0 x = −13 5 x = 13 5 Hence, the solutions of 25x2 = 169 are x = −13/5 and x = 13/5.

Solve for x: 49x2 + 81 = 126xSolve for x: 25x2 = 80x− 64 Solution: Make one side equal to zero, factor, then apply the zero product property. One can also argue that the only number whose square is zero is the number zero. Hence, one can go directly from (7x− 9)2 = 0 to 7x− 9 = 0. Hence, the only solution of 49x2 + 81 = 126x is x = 9/7. 49x2 + 81 = 126x Original equation. 49x2 − 126x+ 81 = 0 Subtract 126x from both sides. Note that the first and last terms of the trinomial are perfect squares. Hence, it make sense to try and factor as a perfect square trinomial, taking the square roots of the first and last terms. (7x− 9)2 = 0 Factor as a perfect square trinomial. Of course, be sure to check the middle term. Because −2(7x)(9) = −126x, the middle term is correct. Because (7x − 9)2 = (7x − 9)(7x− 9), we can use the zero product property to set each factor equal to zero and solve the resulting equations. 7x− 9 = 0 or 7x− 9 = 0 x = 9 7 x = 9 7 Hence, the only solution of 49x2+81 = 126x is x = 9/7.

This is a four-term expression, so we try factoring by grouping. Factor x2 out of the first two terms, and −25 out of the second two terms. x2(2x+ 3)− 25(2x+ 3) = 0 Factor by grouping.

Solution: Note that we have a power of x larger than one, so the equation x3 = 4x is nonlinear. Make one side zero and factor. x3 = 4x Original equation. x3 − 4x = 0 Nonlinear. Make one side zero. x(x2 − 4) = 0 Factor out GCF. x(x + 2)(x− 2) = 0 Apply difference of squares. Note that we now have a product of three factors that equals zero. The zero product property says that at least one of these factors must equal zero. x = 0 or x+ 2 = 0 or x− 2 = 0 x = −2 x = 2 Hence, the solutions of x3 = 4x are x = 0, x = −2, and x = 2.

FACTORING ! ! !  || 6.6 Factoring Strategy When you are concentrating on factoring problems of a single type, after doing a few you tend to get into a rhythm, and the remainder of the exercises, because they are similar, seem to flow. However, when you encounter a mixture of factoring problems of different types, progress is harder. The goal of this section is to set up a strategy to follow when attacking a general factoring problem. If it hasn’t already been done, it is helpful to arrange the terms of the given polynomial in some sort of order (descending or ascending). Then you want to apply the following guidelines. Factoring Strategy. These steps should be followed in the order that they appear. 1. Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF). 2. Look for a special form. a) If you have two perfect squares separated by a minus sign, use the difference of squares pattern to factor: a2 − b2 = (a+ b)(a− b) b) If you have a trinomial whose first and last terms are perfect squares, you should suspect that you have a perfect square trinomial. Take the square roots of the first and last terms and factor as follows. a2 + 2ab+ b2 = (a+ b)2 Be sure to check that the middle term is correct. 3. If you have a trinomial of the form ax2 + bx + c, use the ac-method to factor. 4. If you have a four-term expression, try to factor by grouping. Once you’ve applied the above strategy to the given polynomial, it is quite possible that one of your resulting factors will factor further. Thus, we have the following rule. Factor completely. The factoring process is not complete until none of your remaining factors can be factored further. This is the meaning of the phrase, “factor completely.” 6.6. FACTORING STRATEGY 457 Finally, a very good word of advice. Check your factoring by multiplying. Once you’ve factored the given polynomial completely, it is a very good practice to check your result. If you multiply to find the product of your factors, and get the original given polyno- mial as a result, then you know your factorization is correct. It’s a bit more work to check your factorization, but it’s worth the effort. It helps to eliminate errors and also helps to build a better understanding of the factoring process. Remember, factoring is “unmultiplying,” so the more you multiply, the better you get at factoring. Let’s see what can happen when you don’t check your factorization! Warning! The following solution is incorrect! Factor: 2x4 + 8x2. Solution: Factor out the GCF. 2x4 + 8x2 = 2x2(x2 + 4) = 2x2(x+ 2)2 Note that this student did not bother to check his factorization. Let’s do that for him now. Check: Multiply to check. Remember, when squaring a binomial, there is a middle term. 2x2(x+ 2)2 = 2x2(x2 + 4x+ 4) = 2x4 + 8x3 + 8x2 This is not the same as the original polynomial 2x4 + 8x2, so the student’s factorization is incorrect. Had the student performed this check, he might have caught his error, provided of course, that he multiplies correctly during the check. The correct factorization follows. 2x4 + 8x2 = 2x2(x2 + 4) The sum of squares does not factor, so we are finished. Check: Multiply to check. 2x2(x2 + 4) = 2x4 + 8x2 This is the same as the original polynomial 2x4 + 8x2, so this factorization is correct. 458 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Factor completely: −3x6 + 3x2Factor completely: −4x7 + 64x3 Solution: The first rule of factoring is “Factor out the GCF.” The GCF of −3x6 and 3x2 is 3x2, so we could factor out 3x2. −3x6 + 3x2 = 3x2(−x4 + 1) This is perfectly valid, but we don’t like the fact that the second factor starts with −x4. Let’s factor out −3x2 instead. −3x6 + 3x2 = −3x2(x4 − 1) The second factor is the difference of two squares. Take the square roots, separating one pair with a plus sign, one pair with a minus sign. = −3x2(x2 + 1)(x2 − 1) The sum of squares does not factor. But the last factor is the difference of two squares. Take the square roots, separating one pair with a plus sign, one pair with a minus sign. = −3x2(x2 + 1)(x+ 1)(x− 1) Check: Multiply to check the result. −3x2(x2 + 1)(x+ 1)(x− 1) = −3x2(x2 + 1)(x2 − 1) = −3x2(x4 − 1) = −3x6 + 3x2 The factorization checks.Answer: −4x3(x2 + 4)(x+ 2)(x− 2) !

Factor completely: x3y + 9xy3 + 6x2y2Factor completely: 3a2b4 + 12a4b2 − 12a3b3 Solution: The first rule of factoring is “Factor out the GCF.” The GCF of x3y, 9xy3, and 6x2y2 is xy, so we factor out xy. x3y + 9xy3 + 6x2y2 = xy(x2 + 9y2 + 6xy) Let’s order that second factor in descending powers of x. = xy(x2 + 6xy + 9y2) 6.6. FACTORING STRATEGY 459 The first and last terms of the trinomial factor are perfect squares. We suspect we have a perfect square trinomial, so we take the square roots of the first and last terms, check the middle term, and write: = xy(x+ 3y)2 Thus, x3y + 9xy3 + 6x2y2 = xy(x+ 3y)2. Check: Multiply to check the result. xy(x+ 3y)2 = xy(x2 + 6xy + 9y2) = x3y + 6x2y2 + 9xy3 Except for the order, this result is the same as the given polynomial. The factorization checks.

Factor completely: 2x3 − 48x+ 20x2 Factor completely: 27x3 − 3x4 − 60x2 Solution: In the last example, we recognized a need to rearrange our terms after we pulled out the GCF. This time, let’s arrange our terms in descending powers of x right away. 2x3 − 48x+ 20x2 = 2x3 + 20x2 − 48x Now, let’s factor out the GCF. = 2x(x2 + 10x− 24) The last term of the trinomial factor is not a perfect square. Let’s move to the ac-method to factor. The integer pair −2, 12 has a product equal to ac = −24 and a sum equal to b = 10. Because the coefficient of x2 is one, this is a “drop in place” situation. We drop our pair in place and write: = 2x(x − 2)(x+ 12) Thus, 2x3 − 48x+ 20x2 = 2x(x− 2)(x+ 12). Check: Multiply to check the result. We use the FOIL method shortcut and mental calculations to speed things up. 2x(x− 2)(x+ 12) = 2x(x2 + 10x− 24) = 2x3 + 20x2 − 48x Except for the order, this result is the same as the given polynomial.

We have a trinomial, but the first and last terms are not perfect squares, so let’s apply the ac-method. Ignoring the variables for a moment, we need an integer pair whose product is ac = −48 and whose sum is −13. The integer pair 3,−16 comes to mind (if nothing comes to mind, start listing integer pairs). Break up the middle term into a sum of like terms using the integer pair 3,−16, then factor by grouping. 2a2 − 13ab− 24b2 = 2a2 + 3ab− 16ab− 24b2 = a(2a+ 3b)− 8b(2a+ 3b) = (a− 8b)(2a+ 3b) Thus, 2a2 − 13ab− 24b2 = (a− 8b)(2a+ 3b). Check: Multiply to check the result. We use the FOIL method shortcut and mental calculations to speed things up. (a− 8b)(2a+ 3b) = 2a2 − 13ab− 24b2 This result is the same as the given polynomial.

Comparing 15x2+19x−10 with ax2+bx+c, note that ac = (15)(−10) = −150. We need an integer pair whose product is −150 and whose sum is 19. The integer pair −6 and 25 satisfies these requirements. Because a != 1, this is not a “drop in place” situation, so we need to break up the middle term as a sum of like terms using the pair −6 and 25. = 2x2(15x2 − 6x+ 25x− 10) Factor by grouping.

The total area is found by multiplying these outer dimensions, A = (16 + 2x)(12 + 2x). If the total area is A = 396 square inches, then we have the following equation. (16 + 2x)(12 + 2x) = 396 3.

The variables are already set up for us. x = Distance from base of the cliff (in feet). y = Height above sea level (in feet). t = Time since projectile’s release (in seconds). 2. Set up an equation. The equations are already set up (see equation 6.1 and equation 6.2). 3. Solve the equation. When the projectile splashes into the ocean, its height above sea level at that moment is y = 0 feet. Substitute 0 for y in equation 6.2 and solve the resulting equation for t. y = −16t2 + 288t+ 640 0 = −16t2 + 288t+ 640 We could factor out −16, but since the left-hand side of this equation is zero, it’s a bit easier to divide both sides by −16. Note how we divide each term on the right-hand side by −16. 0 = t2 − 18t− 40 We need a pair of integers so that their product is ac = −40 and their sum is −18. The integer pair 2,−20 comes to mind. Since the coefficient of t2 is one, we can “drop in place” our integer pair. 0 = (t+ 2)(t− 20) Hence, the solutions are t = −2 and t = 20. 4. Answer the question. In answering question (a), the solution t = −2 seconds makes no sense. Thus, the projectile splashes into the ocean at t = 20 seconds. 470 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING In addressing question (b), to find the projectile’s distance from the base of the cliff at this moment, substitute t = 20 in equation 6.1. x = 120t x = 120(20) x = 2400 Hence, at the moment the projectile splashes into the ocean, it is 2,400 feet from the base of the cliff. 5. Look back. The best we can do here is check our solution t = 20 in equation 6.2. y = −16t2 + 288t+ 640 y = −16(20)2 + 288(20) + 640 y = −6400 + 5760 + 640 y = 0 Indeed, at t = 20, the projectile does splash into the ocean. Answer: 12 seconds ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. The product of two consecutive even integers is 728. FindThe product of two consecutive positive odd integers is 483. Find the integers. the integers. Solution: We follow the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a variable dictionary. Let k represent the first even integer. Then k + 2 represents the next consecutive even integer. 2. Set up an equation. The product of the integers is 728. Hence, we have the following equation. k(k + 2) = 728 3. Solve the equation. Expand the left-hand side of the equation. k2 + 2k = 728 The equation is nonlinear. Make one side zero. k2 + 2k − 728 = 0 See Using the Calculator to Assist the ac-Method on page 462. We need an integer pair whose product is ac = −728 and whose sum is b = 2. Enter -728/X in Y1, then set up the table (see Figure 6.31). 6.7. APPLICATIONS OF FACTORING 471 Figure 6.31: Load ac/X , or -728/X into Y1 in the Y= menu. Use the up- and down-arrow keys to scroll. Note that 28,−26 is the desired pair. Because the coefficient of k2 is one, we can “drop in place” the ordered pair. 0 = (k + 28)(k − 26) Hence, the solutions are k = −28 and k = 26. 4. Answer the question. If k = −28, the next consecutive even integer is k + 2 = −26. Secondly, if k = 26, the next consecutive even integer is k + 2 = 28. 5. Look back. Our first pair is −28 and −26. They have the required product of 728. Our second pair is 26 and 28. Their product is also 728. Both solutions check! Answer: 21 and 23 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. A rectangle has perimeter 54 feet and area 180 square feet. A rectangle has perimeter 62 feet and area 234 square feet. Find the dimensions of the rectangle. Find the dimensions of the rectangle. Solution: We follow the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a variable dictionary. A sketch will help us keep our focus. Let L represent the length of the rectangle and let W represent its width. L W L W 472 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING 2. Set up an equation. The perimeter is 54 feet, so 2W+2L = 54, or dividing both sides by 2: W + L = 27 (6.3) The area is 180 square feet, so: LW = 180 (6.4) 3. Solve the equation. The system of equations (equations 6.3 and 6.4) can be solved using the substitution method. First, solve equation 6.3 for W : W = 27− L (6.5) Substitute equation 6.5 in equation 6.4, expand, then make one side zero. L(27− L) = 180 27L− L2 = 180 0 = L2 − 27L+ 180 The integer pair −12,−15 has product ac = 180 and sum b = −27. Moreover, the coefficient of L2 is one, so we can “drop in place” our integer pair. 0 = (L− 12)(L− 15) Hence, the solutions are L = 12 and L = 15. 4. Answer the question. Two possibilities for the width. Substitute L = 12 in (6.5). W = 27− L W = 27− 12 W = 15 Substitute L = 15 in (6.5). W = 27− L W = 27− 15 W = 12 Both answers give the same 15 by 12 foot rectangle, but we usually think of the term “length” as the longer side of the rectangle. So let’s go with the length is L = 15 feet and the width is W = 12 feet. 5. Look back. Let’s add L = 15 feet and W = 12 feet to a diagram. 15 ft 12 ft 15 ft 12 ft 6.7. APPLICATIONS OF FACTORING 473 If we add the dimensions around the rectangle, the perimeter is P = 15+ 12 + 15 + 12, or P = 54 feet, the perimeter required in the problem statement. Next, if we multiply the dimensions, then A = (15)(12), or A = 180 square feet, the area required in the problem statement. Our solution is correct! Answer: length = 18 feet and width = 13 feet ! 474 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING ! ! !  ||
