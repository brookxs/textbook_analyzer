Exceptional Cases Revisited It is entirely possible that you might apply the substitution method to a system of equations that either have an infinite number of solutions or no solutions at all. Let’s see what happens should you do that. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: x = 4 3 y − 7 6x− 8y = −3 2x+ 3y = 6 (4.13) y = −2 3 x+ 4 (4.14) Solution: Equation (4.14) is already solved for y, so let’s substitute − 23x+ 4 for y in equation (4.13). 2x+ 3y = 6 Equation (4.13). 2x+ 3 ( −2 3 x+ 4 ) = 6 Substitute −2 3 x+ 4 for y. 2x− 2x+ 12 = 6 Distribute the 3. 12 = 6 Simplify. Goodness! What happened to the x? How are we supposed to solve for x in this situation? However, note that the resulting statement, 12 = 6, is false, no matter what we use for x and y. This should give us a clue that there are no solutions. Perhaps we are dealing with parallel lines? Let’s solve equation (4.13) for y, putting the equation into slope-intercept form, to help determine the situation. 2x+ 3y = 6 Equation (4.13). 3y = −2x+ 6 Subtract 2x from both sides. y = −2 3 x+ 2 Divide both sides by 3. Thus, our system is equivalent to the following two equations. −5 5 −5 5 x y 2x + 3y = 6 y = − 2 3 x + 4 Figure 4.36: 2x+ 3y = 6 and y = − 23x+ 4 are parallel. No solution. y = − 2 3 x+ 2 (4.15) y = −2 3 x+ 4 (4.16) These lines have the same slope −2/3, but different y-intercepts (one has y- intercept (0, 2), the other has y-intercept (0, 4)). Hence, these are two distinct parallel lines and the system has no solution.Answer: no solution ! 4.2. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY SUBSTITUTION 269 You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Solve the following system of equations: Solve the following system of equations: −28x+ 14y = −126 y = 2x− 9 2x− 6y = −8 (4.17) x = 3y − 4 (4.18) Solution: Equation (4.18) is already solved for x, so let’s substitute 3y−4 for x in equation (4.17). 2x− 6y = −8 Equation (4.17). 2(3y − 4)− 6y = −8 Substitute 3y − 4 for x. 6y − 8− 6y = −8 Distribute the 2. −8 = −8 Simplify. Goodness! What happened to the x? How are we supposed to solve for x in this situation? However, note that the resulting statement, −8 = −8, is a true statement this time. Perhaps this is an indication that we are dealing with the same line? Let’s put both equations (4.17) and (4.18) into slope-intercept form so that we can compare them. −5 5 −5 5 x y x = 3y − 4 2x− 6y = −8 (−4, 0) (−1, 1) (2, 2) Figure 4.37: 2x − 6y = −8 and x = 3y − 4 are the same line. Infinite number of solu- tions. Solve equation (4.17) for y: 2x− 6y = −8 −6y = −2x− 8 y = −2x− 8 −6 y = 1 3 x+ 4 3 Solve equation (4.18) for y: x = 3y − 4 x+ 4 = 3y x+ 4 3 = y y = 1 3 x+ 4 3 Hence, the lines have the same slope and the same y-intercept and they are exactly the same lines. Thus, there are an infinite number of solutions. Indeed, any point on either line is a solution. Examples of solution points are (−4, 0), (−1, 1), and (2, 2). Answer: There are an infinite number of solutions. Examples of solution points are (0,−9), (5, 1), and (−3,−15). ! Tip. When you substitute one equation into another and the variable disap- pears, consider: 1. If the resulting statement is false, then you have two distinct parallel lines and there is no solution. 2. If the resulting statement is true, then you have the same lines and there are an infinite number of solutions. 270 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS ! ! !
