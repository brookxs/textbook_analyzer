Polynomial Functions First we define what we mean by a polynomial function. Polynomial function. A polynomial function is a function defined by a rule that assigns to each domain object a range object defined by a polynomial expression. 5.2. POLYNOMIALS 313 Advanced courses, such as multivariate calculus, frequently use polynomial functions of more than one variable such as f(x, y) = x2 + y2. However, in this course, our focus will be on polynomial functions of a single variable, such as p(x) = 3− 4x− 9x2 and q(x) = x3 − 9x2 + 11. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Given the polynomial function p(x) = x3− 8x− 11, evaluate Given the polynomial function p(x) = −3x2 + 7x+ 4, evaluate p(2). p(−3). Solution: To evaluate p(−3), first restate the function definition, then replace each occurrence of the variable x with open parentheses. p(x) = x3 − 8x− 11 Original function definition. p( ) = ( )3 − 8( )− 11 Replace each occurrence of x with open parentheses. Figure 5.11: Calculator check. Next, substitute −3 for x in the open parentheses prepared in the last step. p(−3) = (−3)3 − 8(−3)− 11 Substitute −3 for x in the open parentheses positions. p(−3) = −27− 8(−3)− 11 Exponent first: (−3)3 = −27. p(−3) = −27 + 24− 11 Multiply: −8(−3) = 24. p(−3) = −14 Add. Hence, p(−3) = −14. You can easily check this result on your calculator (see Figure 5.11). Answer: 6 ! Polynomial Functions First we define what we mean by a polynomial function. Polynomial function.
