The Product of Monomials As long as all of the operations are multiplication, we can use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Multiply: −5(7y). Simplify: −5(7y).Multiply: 3(4x) Solution: Use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup. −5(7y) = [(−5)(7)]y Reorder. Regroup. = −35y Multiply: (−5)(7) = −35. Answer: 12x ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Multiply: (−3x2)(4x3). Simplify: (−3x2)(4x3).Multiply: (7y5)(−2y2) Solution: Use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup. (−3x2)(4x3) = [(−3)(4)](x2x3) Reorder. Regroup. = −12x5 Multiply: (−3)(4) = 12, x2x3 = x5. Answer: −14y7 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Multiply: (−2a2b3)(−5a3b). Simplify: (−2a2b3)(−5a3b).Multiply: (−6st2)(3s3t4) Solution: Use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup. (−2a2b3)(−5a3b) = [(−2)(−5)](a2a3)(b3b) Reorder. Regroup. = 10a5b4 Multiply: (−2)(−5) = 10, a2a3 = a5, and b3b = b4. Answer: −18s4t6 ! 5.6. MULTIPLYING POLYNOMIALS 357 When multiplying monomials, it is much more efficient to make the required calculations mentally. In the case of Example 1, multiply −5 and 7 mentally to get −5(7y) = −35y. In the case of Example 2, multiply −3 and 4 to get −12, then repeat the base x and add exponents to get (−3x2)(4x3) = −12x5. Finally, in the case of Example 3, multiply −2 and −5 to get 10, then repeat the bases and add their exponents.
