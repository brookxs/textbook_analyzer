Zero-Factor Property Our goal is to solve quadratic equations. The method for solving quadratic equations is based on the zero-factor property of real numbers. We were introduced to the zero-factor property in Section Section 8.2. We state it again. Zero-Factor Property If two numbers a and b are multiplied together and the resulting product is 0, then at least one of the numbers must be 0. Algebraically, if a  ·  b = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0, or both a = 0 and b = 0. Zero-Factor Property Our goal is to solve quadratic equations.
