nth Roots For any integer n ≥ 2 , we define the nth root The number that, when raised to the nth power, yields the original number. of a positive real number as that number that when raised to the nth power yields the original number. Given any nonnegative real number a, we have the following property: Here n is called the index and a n is called the radicand. Furthermore, we can refer to the entire expression a √ n as a radical Used when referring to an expression of the form a √ n . . When the index is an integer greater than 3, we say “fourth root”, “fifth root”, and so on. The nth root of any number is apparent if we can write the radicand with an exponent equal to the index.   Example 5: Find the nth root. a. 81 − − √ 4 b. 32 − − √ 5 c. 1 √ 7 d. 1 16 − − √ 4 Solution: a. 81 − − √ 4 = 3 4 − − √ 4 = 3 b. 32 − − √ 5 = 2 5 − − √ 5 = 2 c. 1 √ 7 = 1 7 − − √ 7 = 1 d. 1 16 − − √ 4 = ( 1 2 ) 4 − − − − √ 4 = 1 2 If the index is n = 2 , then the radical indicates a square root and it is customary to write the radical without the index, as illustrated below: We have already taken care to define the principal square root of a number. At this point, we extend this idea to nth roots when n is even. For example, 3 is a fourth root of 81, because 3 4 = 81 . And since ( − 3 ) 4 = 81 , we can say that −3 is a fourth root of 81 as well. Hence we use the radical sign   √ n to denote the principal (nonnegative) nth root The positive nth root when n is even. when n is even. In this case, for any real number a, we use the following property: For example, The negative nth root, when n is even, will be denoted using a negative sign in front of the radical −   √ n . We have seen that the square root of a negative number is not real because any real number, when squared, will result in a positive number. In fact, a similar problem arises for any even index: Here the fourth root of −81 is not a real number because the fourth power of any real number is always positive.   Example 6: Simplify. a. − 16 − − − − √ 4 b. − 16 − − √ 4 Solution: a. The radicand is negative and the index is even. Therefore, there is no real number that when raised to the fourth power is −16. b. Here the radicand is positive. Furthermore, 16 = 2 4 , and we can simplify as follows: When n is odd, the same problems do not occur. The product of an odd number of positive factors is positive and the product of an odd number of negative factors is negative. Hence when the index n is odd, there is only one real nth root for any real number a. And we have the following property:   Example 7: Find the nth root. a. − 32 − − − − √ 5 b. − 1 − − − √ 7 Solution: a. − 32 − − − − √ 5 = ( − 2 ) 5 − − − − − √ 5 = − 2 b. − 1 − − − √ 7 = ( − 1 ) 7 − − − − − √ 7 = − 1   Try this! Find the fourth root: 625 − − − √ 4 . Answer: 5 Video Solution Summary: When n is odd, the nth root is positive or negative depending on the sign of the radicand. When n is even, the nth root is positive or not real depending on the sign of the radicand. nth Roots For any integer n ≥ 2 , we define the nth root The number that, when raised to the nth power, yields the original number. of a positive real number as that number that when raised to the nth power yields the original number.
