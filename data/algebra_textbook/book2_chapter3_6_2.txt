Finding Equations of Parallel and Perpendicular Lines We have seen that the graph of a line is completely determined by two points or one point and its slope. Often you will be asked to find the equation of a line given some geometric relationship—for instance, whether the line is parallel or perpendicular to another line.   Example 3: Find the equation of the line passing through (6, −1) and parallel to y = 1 2 x + 2 . Solution: Here the given line has slope m = 1 2 , and the slope of a line parallel is m ∥ = 1 2 . Since you are given a point and the slope, use the point-slope form of a line to determine the equation. Answer: y = 1 2 x − 4   It is important to have a geometric understanding of this question. We were asked to find the equation of a line parallel to another line passing through a certain point. Through the point (6, −1) we found a parallel line, y = 1 2 x − 4 , shown dashed. Notice that the slope is the same as the given line, but the y-intercept is different. If we keep in mind the geometric interpretation, then it will be easier to remember the process needed to solve the problem.   Example 4: Find the equation of the line passing through (−1, −5) and perpendicular to y = − 1 4 x + 2 . Solution: The given line has slope m = − 1 4 , and thus m ⊥ = + 4 1 = 4 . Substitute this slope and the given point into point-slope form. Answer: y = 4 x − 1   Geometrically, we see that the line y = 4 x − 1 , shown dashed below, passes through (−1, −5) and is perpendicular to the given line. It is not always the case that the given line is in slope-intercept form. Often you have to perform additional steps to determine the slope. The general steps for finding the equation of a line are outlined in the following example.   Example 5: Find the equation of the line passing through (8, −2) and perpendicular to 6 x + 3 y = 1 . Solution: Step 1: Find the slope m. First, find the slope of the given line. To do this, solve for y to change standard form to slope-intercept form, y = m x + b . In this form, you can see that the slope is m = − 2 = − 2 1 , and thus m ⊥ = − 1 − 2 = + 1 2 . Step 2: Substitute the slope you found and the given point into the point-slope form of an equation for a line. In this case, the slope is m ⊥ = 1 2 and the given point is (8, −2). Step 3: Solve for y. Answer: y = 1 2 x − 6   Example 6: Find the equation of the line passing through ( 7 2 ,   1 ) and parallel to 2 x + 14 y = 7 . Solution: Find the slope m by solving for y. The given line has the slope m = − 1 7 , and so m ∥ = − 1 7 . We use this and the point ( 7 2 ,   1 ) in point-slope form. Answer: y = − 1 7 x + 3 2   Try this! Find the equation of the line perpendicular to x − 3 y = 9 and passing through ( − 1 2 ,   2 ) . Answer: y = − 3 x + 1 2 Video Solution When finding an equation of a line perpendicular to a horizontal or vertical line, it is best to consider the geometric interpretation.   Example 7: Find the equation of the line passing through (−3, −2) and perpendicular to y = 4 . Solution: We recognize that y = 4 is a horizontal line and we want to find a perpendicular line passing through (−3, −2). If we draw the line perpendicular to the given horizontal line, the result is a vertical line. Equations of vertical lines look like x = k . Since it must pass through (−3, −2), we conclude that x = − 3 is the equation. All ordered pair solutions of a vertical line must share the same x-coordinate. Answer: x = − 3   We can rewrite the equation of any horizontal line, y = k , in slope-intercept form as follows: Written in this form, we see that the slope is m = 0 = 0 1 . If we try to find the slope of a perpendicular line by finding the opposite reciprocal, we run into a problem: m ⊥ = − 1 0 , which is undefined. This is why we took care to restrict the definition to two nonvertical lines. Remember that horizontal lines are perpendicular to vertical lines.
