The Integers If we collect all the natural numbers and their additive inverses, then include the number zero, we have a collection of numbers called the integers. The Integers. The set Z = {. . . ,−5,−4,−3,−2,−1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .} is called the set of integers. The integers can be made to correspond to points on a line in a very natural manner. First, draw a line, then locate the number zero anywhere you wish. Secondly, place the number one to the right of zero. This determines the length of one unit. Finally, locate the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . to the right of zero, then their opposites (additive inverses) −1, −2, −3, −4, −5, . . . to the left of zero (see Figure 1.1). −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Figure 1.1: Each integer corresponds to a unique position on the number line. Note that as we move to the right on the number line, the integers get larger. On the other hand, as we move to the left on the number line, the integers get smaller. Positive and negative integers. On the number line, some integers lie to the right of zero and some lie to the left of zero. 4 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS • If a is an integer that lies to the right of zero, then a is called a positive integer. • If a is an integer that lies to the left of zero, then a is called a negative integer. Thus, 4, 25, and 142 are positive integers, while−7, −53, and−435 are negative integers.
