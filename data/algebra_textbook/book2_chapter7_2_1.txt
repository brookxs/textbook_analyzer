Multiplying Rational Expressions When multiplying fractions, we can multiply the numerators and denominators together and then reduce, as illustrated: Multiplying rational expressions is performed in a similar manner. For example, In general, given polynomials P, Q, R, and S, where Q ≠ 0 and S ≠ 0 , we have In this section, assume that all variable expressions in the denominator are nonzero unless otherwise stated.   Example 1: Multiply: 12 x 2 5 y 3 ⋅ 20 y 4 6 x 3 . Solution: Multiply numerators and denominators and then cancel common factors. Answer: 8 y x   Example 2: Multiply: x − 3 x + 5 ⋅ x + 5 x + 7 . Solution: Leave the product in factored form and cancel the common factors. Answer: x − 3 x + 7   Example 3: Multiply: 15 x 2 y 3 ( 2 x − 1 ) ⋅ x ( 2 x − 1 ) 3 x 2 y ( x + 3 ) . Solution: Leave the polynomials in the numerator and denominator factored so that we can cancel the factors. In other words, do not apply the distributive property. Answer: 5 x y 2 x + 3   Typically, rational expressions will not be given in factored form. In this case, first factor all numerators and denominators completely. Next, multiply and cancel any common factors, if there are any.   Example 4: Multiply: x + 5 x − 5 ⋅ x − 5 x 2 − 25 . Solution: Factor the denominator x 2 − 25 as a difference of squares. Then multiply and cancel. Keep in mind that 1 is always a factor; so when the entire numerator cancels out, make sure to write the factor 1. Answer: 1 x − 5   Example 5: Multiply: x 2 + 3 x + 2 x 2 − 5 x + 6 ⋅ x 2 − 7 x + 12 x 2 + 8 x + 7 . Solution: It is a best practice to leave the final answer in factored form. Answer: ( x + 2 ) ( x − 4 ) ( x − 2 ) ( x + 7 )   Example 6: Multiply: . Solution: The trinomial in the numerator has a negative leading coefficient. Recall that it is a best practice to first factor out a −1 and then factor the resulting trinomial. Answer:   Example 7: Multiply: . Solution: We replace with so that we can cancel this factor.
