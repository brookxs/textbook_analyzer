Addition of Numbers with Unlike Signs Now let us perform the addition 2 + ( − 6) . These two numbers have unlike signs. This type of addition can also be illustrated using the number line. We begin at 0, the origin.Since 2 is positive, we move 2 units to the right.Since − 6 is negative, we move, from the 2, 6 units to the left.We are now located at − 4 . A rule for adding two numbers that have unlike signs is suggested by noting that if the signs are disregarded, 4 can be obtained from 2 and 6 by subtracting 2 from 6. But 2 and 6 are precisely the absolute values of 2 and − 6 . Also, notice that the sign of the number with the larger absolute value is negative and that the sign of the resulting sum is negative. Adding Numbers with Unlike Signs To add two real numbers that have unlike signs, subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and associate the sign of the number with the larger absolute value with this difference.
