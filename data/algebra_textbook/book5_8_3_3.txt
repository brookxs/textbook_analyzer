Solving Equations by Completing the Square Consider the following nonlinear equation. x2 = 2x+ 2 The standard approach is to make one side zero and factor. x2 − 2x− 2 = 0 However, one quickly realizes that there is no integer pair whose product is ac = −2 and whose sum is b = −2. So, what does one do in this situation? The answer is “Complete the square.” 564 CHAPTER 8. QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Use completing the square to help solve x2 = 2x+ 2.Use completing the square to help solve x2 = 3− 6x. Solution: First, move 2x to the left-hand side of the equation, keeping the constant 2 on the right-hand side of the equation. x2 − 2x = 2 On the left, take one-half of the coefficient of x: (1/2)(−2) = −1. Square the result: (−1)2 = 1. Add this result to both sides of the equation. x2 − 2x+ 1 = 2 + 1 x2 − 2x+ 1 = 3 We can now factor the left-hand side as a perfect square trinomial. (x− 1)2 = 3 Now, as in Examples 1, 2, and 3, we can take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember, there are two square roots. x− 1 = ±√3 Finally, add 1 to both sides of the equation. x = 1±√3 Thus, the equation x2 = 2x+ 2 has two answers, x = 1−√3 and x = 1+√3. Check: Let’s use the calculator to check the solutions. First, store 1−√3 in X (see the image on the left in Figure 8.11). Then enter the left- and right-hand sides of the equation x2 = 2x + 2 and compare the results (see the image on the left in Figure 8.11). In similar fashion, check the second answer 1 + √ 3 (see the image on the right in Figure 8.11). Figure 8.11: Checking 1−√3 and 1 +√3 in the equation x2 = 2x+ 2. In both cases, note that the left- and right-hand sides of x2 = 2x+2 produce the same result. Hence, both 1−√3 and 1+√3 are valid solutions of x2 = 2x+2. Answer: −3 + 2√3, −3− 2√3 ! 8.3.

Take half of the coefficient of x: (1/2)(−8) = −4. Square: (−4)2 = 16. Now add 16 to both sides of the equation. x2 − 8x+ 16 = 12 + 16 Add 16 to both sides. (x− 4)2 = 28 Factor left-hand side. x− 4 = ±√28 There are two square roots. Note that the answer is not in simple radical form. x− 4 = ±√4√7 Factor out a perfect square. x− 4 = ±2√7 Simplify: √4 = 2. x = 4± 2√7 Add 4 to both sides.
