Reciprocals Reciprocals Two numbers whose product is 1 are called reciprocals of each other. Sample Set A The following pairs of numbers are reciprocals. Example 4.46.  Example 4.47.  Example 4.48.  Notice that we can find the reciprocal of a nonzero number in fractional form by inverting it (exchanging positions of the numerator and denominator). Practice Set A Find the reciprocal of each number. Exercise 4.6.1. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.6.2. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.6.3. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.6.4. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.6.5. (Go to Solution) Hint Write this number as an improper fraction first. Exercise 4.6.6. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.6.7.
