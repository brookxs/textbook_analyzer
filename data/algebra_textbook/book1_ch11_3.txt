 || When Substitution Works Best We know how to solve a linear equation in one variable. We shall now study a method for solving a system of two linear equations in two variables by transforming the two equations in two variables into one equation in one variable.To make this transformation, we need to eliminate one equation and one variable. We can make this elimination by substitution. When Substitution Works Best The substitution method works best when either of these conditions exists: One of the variables has a coefficient of 1,â€‰ or One of the variables can be made to have a coefficient of 1 without introducing fractions.  || The Substitution Method The Substitution Method To solve a system of two linear equations in two variables, Solve one of the equations for one of the variables. Substitute the expression for the variable chosen in step 1 into the other equation. Solve the resulting equation in one variable. Substitute the value obtained in step 3 into the equation obtained in step 1 and solve to obtain the value of the other variable. Check the solution in both equations. Write the solution as an ordered pair.  || Substitution And Parallel Lines The following rule alerts us to the fact that the two lines of a system are parallel. Substitution and Parallel Lines If computations eliminate all the variables and produce a contradiction, the two lines of a system are parallel, and the system is called inconsistent.  || Substitution And Coincident Lines The following rule alerts us to the fact that the two lines of a system are coincident. Substitution and Coincident Lines If computations eliminate all the variables and produce an identity, the two lines of a system are coincident and the system is called dependent.  ||
