The Logic Behind the Method As we have done with addition, subtraction, and multiplication of decimals, we will study a method of division of decimals by converting them to fractions, then we will make a general rule. We will proceed by using this example: Divide 196.8 by 6. We have, up to this point, divided 196.8 by 6 and have gotten a quotient of 32 with a remainder of 4. If we follow our intuition and bring down the .8, we have the division 4.8÷6. Thus, 4.8÷6 = .8. Now, our intuition and experience with division direct us to place the .8 immedi­ately to the right of 32. From these observations, we suggest the following method of division.
