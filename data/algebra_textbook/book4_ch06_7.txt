 || The Logic Behind the Method As we have done with addition, subtraction, and multiplication of decimals, we will study a method of division of decimals by converting them to fractions, then we will make a general rule. We will proceed by using this example: Divide 196.8 by 6. We have, up to this point, divided 196.8 by 6 and have gotten a quotient of 32 with a remainder of 4. If we follow our intuition and bring down the .8, we have the division 4.8÷6. Thus, 4.8÷6 = .8. Now, our intuition and experience with division direct us to place the .8 immedi­ately to the right of 32. From these observations, we suggest the following method of division.  || A Method of Dividing a Decimal by a Nonzero Whole Number Method of Dividing a Decimal by a Nonzero Whole Number To divide a decimal by a nonzero whole number: Write a decimal point above the division line and directly over the decimal point of the dividend. Proceed to divide as if both numbers were whole numbers. If, in the quotient, the first nonzero digit occurs to the right of the decimal point, but not in the tenths position, place a zero in each position between the decimal point and the first nonzero digit of the quotient. Sample Set A Find the decimal representations of the following quotients. Example 6.44.  114.1÷7 = 7 Thus, 114.1÷7 = 16.3. Check: If 114.1÷7 = 16.3, then 7⋅16.3 should equal 114.1. Example 6.45.  0.02068÷4 Place zeros in the tenths and hundredths positions. (See Step 3.) Thus, 0.02068÷4 = 0.00517. Practice Set A Find the following quotients. Exercise 6.7.1.

(Go to Solution) 0.000496÷8  || A Method of Dividing a Decimal By a Nonzero Decimal Now that we can divide decimals by nonzero whole numbers, we are in a position to divide decimals by a nonzero decimal. We will do so by converting a division by a decimal into a division by a whole number, a process with which we are already familiar. We'll illustrate the method using this example: Divide 4.32 by 1.8. Let's look at this problem as . The divisor is . We can convert into a whole number if we multiply it by 10. But, we know from our experience with fractions, that if we multiply the denomina­tor of a fraction by a nonzero whole number, we must multiply the numerator by that same nonzero whole number. Thus, when converting to a whole number by multiplying it by 10, we must also multiply the numerator by 10. We have converted the division 4.32÷1.8 into the division 43.2÷18, that is, Notice what has occurred. If we "move" the decimal point of the divisor one digit to the right, we must also "move" the decimal point of the dividend one place to the right. The word "move" actually indicates the process of multiplication by a power of 10. Method of Dividing a Decimal by a Decimal Number To divide a decimal by a nonzero decimal, Convert the divisor to a whole number by moving the decimal point to the position immediately to the right of the divisor's last digit. Move the decimal point of the dividend to the right the same number of digits it was moved in the divisor. Set the decimal point in the quotient by placing a decimal point directly above the newly located decimal point in the dividend. Divide as usual. Sample Set B Find the following quotients. Example 6.46.  32.66÷7.1 The divisor has one decimal place. Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 1 place to the right. Set the decimal point. Divide as usual. Thus, 32.66÷7.1 = 4.6. Check: 32.66÷7.1 = 4.6 if 4.6 × 7.1 = 32.66 Example 6.47.  1.0773÷0.513 The divisor has 3 decimal places. Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 3 places to the right. Set the decimal place and divide. Thus, 1.0773÷0.513 = 2.1. Checking by multiplying 2.1 and 0.513 will convince us that we have obtained the correct result. (Try it.) Example 6.48.  12÷0.00032 The divisor has 5 decimal places. Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 5 places to the right. We will need to add 5 zeros to 12. Set the decimal place and divide. This is now the same as the division of whole numbers. Checking assures us that 12÷0.00032 = 37,500. Practice Set B Find the decimal representation of each quotient. Exercise 6.7.5.

(Go to Solution) 8,162.41÷10,000  || Calculators Calculators can be useful for finding quotients of decimal numbers. As we have seen with the other calculator operations, we can sometimes expect only approximate results. We are alerted to approximate results when the calculator display is filled with digits. We know it is possible that the operation may produce more digits than the calculator has the ability to show. For example, the multiplication produces 5 + 4 = 9 decimal places. An eight-digit display calculator only has the ability to show eight digits, and an approximation results. The way to recognize a possible approximation is illustrated in problem 3 of the next sample set. Sample Set C Find each quotient using a calculator. If the result is an approximation, round to five decimal places. Example 6.49.  12.596÷4.7 Table 6.30.     Display Reads Type 12.596 12.596 Press ÷ 12.596 Type 4.7 4.7 Press = 2.68 Since the display is not filled, we expect this to be an accurate result. Example 6.50.  0.5696376÷0.00123 Table 6.31.     Display Reads Type .5696376 0.5696376 Press ÷ 0.5696376 Type .00123 0.00123 Press = 463.12 Since the display is not filled, we expect this result to be accurate. Example 6.51.  0.8215199÷4.113 Table 6.32.     Display Reads Type .8215199 0.8215199 Press ÷ 0.8215199 Type 4.113 4.113 Press = 0.1997373 There are EIGHT DIGITS — DISPLAY FILLED! BE AWARE OF POSSIBLE APPROXI­MATIONS. We can check for a possible approximation in the following way. Since the division can be checked by multiplying 4 and 3, we can check our division by performing the multiplication This multiplication produces 3 + 7 = 10 decimal digits. But our suspected quotient contains only 8 decimal digits. We conclude that the answer is an approximation. Then, rounding to five decimal places, we get 0.19974. Practice Set C Find each quotient using a calculator. If the result is an approximation, round to four decimal places. Exercise 6.7.12. (Go to Solution) 42.49778÷14.261 Exercise 6.7.13.

Let's look at each of these again and then, from these observations, make a general statement regarding division of a decimal num­ber by a power of 10. Thus, 8,162.41÷10 = 816.241. Notice that the divisor 10 is composed of one 0 and that the quotient 816.241 can be obtained from the dividend 8,162.41 by moving the decimal point one place to the left. Thus, 8,162.41÷100 = 81.6241. Notice that the divisor 100 is composed of two 0's and that the quotient 81.6241 can be obtained from the dividend by moving the decimal point two places to the left. Using these observations, we can suggest the following method for dividing decimal numbers by powers of 10. Dividing a Decimal Fraction by a Power of 10 To divide a decimal fraction by a power of 10, move the decimal point of the decimal fraction to the left as many places as there are zeros in the power of 10. Add zeros if necessary. Sample Set D Find each quotient. Example 6.52.  9,248.6÷100 Since there are 2 zeros in this power of 10, we move the decimal point 2 places to the left. Example 6.53.  3.28÷10,000 Since there are 4 zeros in this power of 10, we move the decimal point 4 places to the left. To do so, we need to add three zeros. Practice Set D Find the decimal representation of each quotient. Exercise 6.7.15. (Go to Solution) 182.5÷10 Exercise 6.7.16. (Go to Solution) 182.5÷100 Exercise 6.7.17.
