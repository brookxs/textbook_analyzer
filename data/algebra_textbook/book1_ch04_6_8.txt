Multiplying a Polynomial by a Polynomial Since we can consider an expression enclosed within parentheses as a single quantity, we have, by the distributive property, For convenience we will use the commutative property of addition to write this expression so that the first two terms contain a and the second two contain b . (a + b)(c + d) = a c + a d + b c + b d This method is commonly called the FOIL method. FFirst terms OOuter terms IInner terms LLast terms Rearranging, Combining like terms, = 5a + 5b This use of the distributive property suggests the following rule. Multiplying a Polynomial by a Polynomial To multiply two polynomials together, multiply every term of one polynomial by every term of the other polynomial.
