The Degree of a Polynomial To find the degree of a polynomial, locate the term of the polynomial having the highest degree. The degree of a polynomial. The degree of a polynomial is the degree of the term having the highest degree. 312 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Finding the degree of a polynomial of a single variable is pretty easy. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. What is the degree of the polynomial x3−4x2+5−6x+2x7?What is the degree of the polynomial 2x3 + 8x2 + 3x4 + 2x+ 10? Solution: First, let’s arrange the polynomial in descending powers of x. 2x7 + x3 − 4x2 − 6x+ 5 Arranging the polynomial in descending powers of x makes it easier to see that the term of the polynomial with the highest degree is 2x7. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is 7.Answer: 4 ! Finding the degree of a polynomial of more than one variable is a little bit trickier. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. What is the degree of the polynomial x4 − 2x3y7 + y5?What is the degree of the polynomial x2y4− 6x2y2 +5x2y5− 2xy? Solution: Note that the polynomial is already arranged in descending powers of x, an arrangement that is probably as good as we are going to get. In the following table, we list the degree of each term. Remember, the degree of any term is found by summing the exponents on its variables. Term Degree x4 4 −2x3y7 10 y5 5 Hence, the term with the highest degree is −2x3y7, making 10 the degree of the polynomial.Answer: 7 !
