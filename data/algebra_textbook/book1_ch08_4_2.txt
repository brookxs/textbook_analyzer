Multiplication Of Rational Expressions Rational expressions are multiplied together in much the same way that arithmetic fractions are multiplied together. To multiply rational numbers, we do the following: Definition: Method for Multiplying Rational Numbers Reduce each fraction to lowest terms. Multiply the numerators together. Multiply the denominators together. Rational expressions are multiplied together using exactly the same three steps. Since rational expressions tend to be longer than arithmetic fractions, we can simplify the multiplication process by adding one more step. Definition: Method for Multiplying Rational Expressions Factor all numerators and denominators. Reduce to lowest terms first by dividing out all common factors. (It is perfectly legitimate to cancel the numerator of one fraction with the denominator of another.) Multiply numerators together. Multiply denominators. It is often convenient, but not necessary, to leave denominators in factored form.
