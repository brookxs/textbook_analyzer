General Guidelines for Solving Quadratic Equations Use the coefficients of a quadratic equation to help decide which method is most appropriate for solving it. While the quadratic formula always works, it is sometimes not the most efficient method. Given any quadratic equation in standard form, a x 2 + b x + c = 0 , general guidelines for determining the method for solving it follow: If c = 0, then factor out the GCF and solve by factoring. If b = 0, then solve by extracting the roots. If a, b, and c are all nonzero, then determine the value for the discriminant, b 2 − 4 a c : If the discriminant is a perfect square, then solve by factoring. If the discriminant is not a perfect square, then solve using the quadratic formula. If the discriminant is positive, we obtain two real solutions. If the discriminant is negative, then there is no real solution.   Example 5: Solve: 15 x 2 − 5 x = 0 . Solution: In this case, c = 0 and we can solve by factoring out the GCF. Answer: The solutions are 0 and 1/3.   Example 6: Solve: 3 x 2 − 5 = 0 . Solution: In this case, b = 0 and we can solve by extracting the roots. Answer: The solutions are ± 15 √ 3 .   Example 7: Solve: 9 x 2 − 6 x − 7 = 0 . Solution: Begin by identifying a, b, and c as the coefficients of each term. Here Substitute these values into the discriminant and then simplify. Since the discriminant is positive and not a perfect square, use the quadratic formula and expect two real solutions. Answer: The solutions are 1 ± 2 2 √ 3 .   Example 8: Solve: 4 x ( x − 2 ) = − 7 . Solution: Begin by rewriting the quadratic equation in standard form. Here Substitute these values into the discriminant and then simplify. Since the discriminant is negative, the solutions are not real numbers. Answer: No real solution   Example 9: Solve: ( 3 x + 5 ) ( 3 x + 7 ) = 6 x + 10 . Solution: Begin by rewriting the quadratic equation in standard form. Substitute a = 9, b = 30, and c = 25 into the discriminant. Since the discriminant is 0, solve by factoring and expect one real solution, a double root. Answer: The solution is −5/3.   Try this! Solve: 5 x 2 + 2 x − 7 = 2 x − 3 .
