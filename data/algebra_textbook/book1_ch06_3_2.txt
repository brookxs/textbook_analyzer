The Factorization Process We introduce the process of factoring a monomial from a polynomial by examining a problem: Suppose that 12x 2 + 20x is the product and one of the factors is 4x . To find the other factor we could set up the problem this way: 4x⋅(               ) = 12x 2 + 20x Since the product 12x 2 + 20x consists of two terms, the expression multiplying 4x must consist of two terms, since, by the distributive property Now we see that this problem is simply an extension of finding the factors of a monomial. Thus, 4x⋅( 3x + 5 ) = 12x 2 + 20x . Usually, these divisions can be done mentally and the terms of the factor filled in directly.
