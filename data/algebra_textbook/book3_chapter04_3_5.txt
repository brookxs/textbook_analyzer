Positive and Negative Slope The x coordinate increases to the right, so moving from left to right is motion in the positive x direction. Suppose that you are going uphill as you move in the positive x direction. Then both your x and y coordinates are increasing, so the ratio of rise over run will be positive—you will have a positive increase in y for a positive increase in x. On the other hand, if you are going downhill as you move from left to right, then the ratio of rise over run will be negative because you lose height for a given positive increase in x. The thing to remember is: As you go from left to right, Uphill = Positive Slope Downhill = Negative Slope And of course, no change in height means that the line has zero slope.   Some Slopes Positive and Negative Slope The x coordinate increases to the right, so moving from left to right is motion in the positive x direction.
