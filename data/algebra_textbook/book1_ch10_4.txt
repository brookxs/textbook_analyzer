 || The Method Of Extraction Of Roots Extraction of Roots Quadratic equations of the form x 2 − K = 0 can be solved by the method of extraction of roots by rewriting it in the form x 2 = K. To solve x 2 = K, we are required to find some number, x, that when squared produces K. This number, x, must be a square root of K. If K is greater than zero, we know that it possesses two square roots, and We also know thatWe now have two replacements for x that produce true statements when substituted into the equation. Thus, and are both solutions to x 2 = K. We use the notation to denote both the principal and the secondary square roots.  || The Nature of Solutions Solutions of x 2 = K For quadratic equations of the form x 2 = K, If K is greater than or equal to zero, the solutions are If K is negative, no real number solutions exist. If K is zero, the only solution is 0.  ||  Calculator Problems For the following problems, round each result to the nearest hundredth. Exercise 10.4.63.
