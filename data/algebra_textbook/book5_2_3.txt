2.3 Clearing Fractions and Decimals In this section we introduce techniques that clear fractions and decimals from equations, making the resulting equation a lot easier to solve. When clearing fractions from an equation, you will need to simplify products like the ones posed in the following examples. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify: 12 ( 2 3 x ) . Simplify: 15 ( 3 5 x )Solution: When we multiply three numbers, such as 12, 2/3, and x, the associative property of multiplication tells us that it does not matter which two numbers we multiply first. We use the associative property to regroup, then multiply numerators and denominators and simplify the result. 12 ( 2 3 x ) = ( 12 · 2 3 ) x Associative property of multiplication. = 24 3 x Multiply: 12 · 2 = 24. = 8x Divide: 24/3 = 8. Answer: 9x ! Example 1 shows all of the steps involved in arriving at the answer. How- ever, the goal in this section is to perform this calculation mentally. So we just “Multiply 12 and 2 to get 24, then divide 24 by 3 to get 8.” This approach allows us to write down the answer without doing any work. 12 ( 2 3 x ) = 8x You should practice this mental calculation until you can write down the answer without writing down any steps. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Simplify: 18 ( 2 9 x ) Simplify: 14 ( 3 7 x )Solution: This time we perform the calculations mentally. Multiply 18 and 2 to get 36, then divide 36 by 9 to get 4. 18 ( 2 9 x ) = 4x Answer: 6x ! 100 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES When the numbers get larger, the mental calculations become harder. For example, consider 72 ( 8 9 x ) In this case, the work “multiply 72 and 8 to get 576, then divide 576 by 9 to get 64” is a bit difficult to carry in your head. However, this is when the calculator comes to the rescue. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Use your calculator to help simplify 72 ( 8 9 x ) . Use your calculator to simplify: 81 ( 5 9 x ) Solution: Use your calculator to multiply 72 and 8, then divide by 9. Enter 72*8/9 and press the ENTER key. Thus, 72 ( 8 9 x ) = 64x. Answer: 45x ! 2.3 Clearing Fractions and Decimals In this section we introduce techniques that clear fractions and decimals from equations, making the resulting equation a lot easier to solve.

Answer: 45x !  || Canceling is More Efficient In Examples 1, 2, and 3, we multiplied numerators, then divided by the sole denominator. We also saw that it is a bit difficult to carry the work in our head as the numbers grow larger. In Chapter 1, Section 3, we saw that canceling reduces the size of the numbers and simplifies the work. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify: 72 ( 8 9 x ) . Simplify: 64 ( 5 8 x ) Solution: In Example 3, we used our calculator to multiply 72 and 8 to get 576, then divided 576 by 9 to get 64. In this solution, we divide 9 into 72 to get 8, then multiply 8 by 8 to get 64. We get the same answer, but because the intermediate numbers are much smaller, the calculations are much easier to do mentally. 2.3. CLEARING FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 101 72 ( 8 9 x ) = ( 72 · 8 9 ) x Associative property of multiplication. = (8 · 8)x Divide: 72/9 = 8. = 64x Multiply: 8 · 8 = 64. Answer: 40x ! Example 4 shows all of the steps involved in arriving at the answer. Again, the goal in this section is to perform this calculation mentally, so we just “Divide 9 into 72 to get 8, then multiply 8 by 8 to get 644.” 72 ( 8 9 x ) = 64x Not only does this approach allow us to write down the answer without doing any work, the numerical calculations involve smaller numbers. You should practice this mental calculation until you can write down the answer without writing down any steps. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify: 27 ( 5 9 x ) . Simplify: 18 ( 3 2 x )Solution: Divide 9 into 27 to get 3, then multiply 3 by 5 to get 15. 27 ( 5 9 x ) = 15x Answer: 27x ! Note: The technique shown in Examples 4 and 5 is the technique we’ll use in the remainder of this section. Dividing (canceling) first is far more efficient, the smaller numbers allowing us to perform the calculation mentally.  || Clearing Fractions from an Equation Now that we’ve done the required fraction work, we can now concentrate on clearing fractions from an equation. Once the fractions are removed from the equation, the resulting equivalent equation is far easier to solve than the orig- inal. Clearing fractions from an equation. To clear fractions from an equation, multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator. 102 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Solve for x: x+ 2 3 = 1 2 .Solve for x: x− 3 4 = 1 2 Solution: The common denominator for 2/3 and 1/2 is 6. We begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 6. x+ 2 3 = 1 2 Original equation. 6 ( x+ 2 3 ) = 6 ( 1 2 ) Multiply both sides by 6. 6x+ 6 ( 2 3 ) = 6 ( 1 2 ) On the left, distribute the 6. To simplify 6(2/3), divide 6 by 3 to get 2, then multiply 2 by 2 to get 4. Thus, 6(2/3) = 4. Similarly, 6(1/2) = 3. 6x+ 4 = 3 Multiply: 6 ( 2 3 ) = 4, 6 ( 1 2 ) = 3. Note that the fractions are now cleared from the equation. To isolate terms containing x on one side of the equation, subtract 4 from both sides of the equation. 6x+ 4− 4 = 3− 4 Subtract 4 from both sides. 6x = −1 Simplify both sides. To “undo” multiplying by 6, divide both sides by 6. 6x 6 = −1 6 Divide both sides by 6. x = −1 6 Simplify both sides. Check: Let’s use the TI-84 to check the solution. 1. Store −1/6 in the variable X using the following keystrokes. (-) 1 ÷ 6 STO! X,T,θ,n ENTER The result is shown in the first line in Figure 2.9. 2. Enter the left-hand side of the original equation: x + 2/3. Use the fol- lowing keystrokes. 2.3. CLEARING FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 103 X,T,θ,n + 2 ÷ 3 ENTER The result is shown in the second line in Figure 2.9. 3. Press the MATH key, then select 1:"Frac and press the ENTER key. The result is shown in the third line in Figure 2.9. Figure 2.9: Checking that −1/6 is a solution of x+ 2/3 = 1/2. The result is identical to the right-hand side of the equation x + 2/3 = 1/2. Thus, the solution checks. Answer: x = 5/4 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Solve for x: 4 5 x = −4 3 . Solve for x: −3 7 x = 3 2 Solution: The common denominator for 4/5 and −4/3 is 15. We begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 15. 4 5 x = −4 3 Original equation. 15 ( 4 5 x ) = 15 ( −4 3 ) Multiply both sides by 15. To simplify 15(4/5), divide 5 into 15 to get 3, then multiply 3 by 4 to get 12. Thus, 15(4/5) = 12. Similarly, 15(−4/3) = −20 12x = −20 Multiply. To “undo” multiplying by 12, we divide both sides by 12. 12x 12 = −20 12 Divide both sides by 12. x = −5 3 Reduce to lowest terms. 104 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Check: To check, substitute −5/3 for x in the original equation. 4 5 x = −4 3 Original equation. 4 5 ( −5 3 ) = −4 3 Substitute −5/3 for x. −20 15 = −4 3 Multiply numerators and denominators. −4 3 = −4 3 Reduce. The fact that the last line is a true statement guarantees the −5/3 is a solution of the equation 4 5 x = −4 3 .Answer: x = −7/2 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Solve for x: 2x 3 − 3 4 = 1 2 − 3x 4 .Solve for x: 5x 9 − 2 3 = 5 9 − 3x 2 Solution: The common denominator for 2x/3, −3/4, 1/2, and −3x/4 is 12. We begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 12. 2x 3 − 3 4 = 1 2 − 3x 4 Original equation. 12 ( 2x 3 − 3 4 ) = 12 ( 1 2 − 3x 4 ) Multiply both sides by 12. 12 ( 2x 3 ) − 12 ( 3 4 ) = 12 ( 1 2 ) − 12 ( 3x 4 ) Distribute the 12 on each side. To simplify 12(2x/3), divide 3 into 12 to get 4, then multiply 4 by 2x to get 8x. Thus, 12(2x/3) = 8x. Similarly, 12(3/4) = 9, 12(1/2) = 6, and 12(3x/4) = 9x. 8x− 9 = 6− 9x Multiply. Note that the fractions are now cleared from the equation. We now need to isolate terms containing x on one side of the equation. To remove the term −9x from the right-hand side, add 9x to both sides of the equation. 8x− 9 + 9x = 6− 9x+ 9x Add 9x to both sides. 17x− 9 = 6 Simplify both sides. To remove the term −9 from the left-hand side, add 9 to both sides of the equation. 17x− 9 + 9 = 6 + 9 Add 9 to both sides. 17x = 15 Simplify both sides. 2.3. CLEARING FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 105 Finally, to “undo” multiplying by 17, divide both sides of the equation by 17. 17x 17 = 15 17 Divide both sides by 17. x = 15 17 Simplify both sides. Check: Let’s use the TI-84 to check the solution. 1. Store the number 15/17 in the variable X using the following keystrokes. 1 5 ÷ 1 7 STO! X,T,θ,n ENTER The result is shown in Figure 2.10. Figure 2.10: Storing 15/17 in X. 2. Enter the left-hand side of the original equation: 2x 3 − 3 4 . Use the fol- lowing keystrokes. 2 × X,T,θ,n ÷ 3 − 3 ÷ 4 ENTER The result is shown in the first image in Figure 2.11). 3. Enter the right-hand side of the original equation: 1 2 − 3x 4 . Use the following keystrokes. 1 ÷ 2 − 3 × X,T,θ,n ÷ 4 ENTER The result is shown in the second image in Figure 2.11. Because both sides simplify to −.1617647059 when 15/17 is substituted for x, this guarantees that 15/17 is a solution of the equation 2x/3−3/4 = 1/2−3x/4. Answer: x = 22/37 ! 106 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Figure 2.11: Checking 15/17 in 2x/3− 3/4 = 1/2− 3x/4.  || Clearing Decimals from an Equation Multiplying by the appropriate power of ten will clear the decimals from an equation, making the resulting equivalent equation far easier to solve. Before we begin, first recall the following facts about multiplying by powers of ten. • 10(1.2345) = 12.345. Multiplying by 10 moves the decimal point one place to the right. • 100(1.2345) = 123.45. Multiplying by 100 moves the decimal point two places to the right. • 1000(1.2345) = 1234.5. Multiplying by 1000 moves the decimal point three places to the right. Note the pattern: The number of zeros in the power of ten determines the number of places to move the decimal point. So, for example, if we multiply by 1,000,000, which has six zeros, this will move the decimal point six places to the right. You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Solve for x: 2.3x− 1.25 = 0.04x.Solve for x: 1.34− 4.5x = 2.2 Solution: The first term of 2.3x − 1.25 = 0.04x has one decimal place, the second term has two decimal places, and the third and final term has two decimal places. At a minimum, we need to move each decimal point two places to the right in order to clear the decimals from the equation. Consequently, we multiply both sides of the equation by 100. 2.3x− 1.25 = 0.04x Original equation. 100(2.3x− 1.25) = 100(0.04x) Multiply both sides by 100. 100(2.3x)− 100(1.25) = 100(0.04x) Distribute the 100. 230x− 125 = 4x Multiplying by 100 moves all decimal points two places to the right. 2.3. CLEARING FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 107 Note that the decimals are now cleared from the equation. We must now isolate all terms containing x on one side of the equation. To remove the term 4x from the right-hand side, subtract 4x from both sides of the equation. 230x− 125− 4x = 4x− 4x Subtract 4x from both sides. 226x− 125 = 0 Simplify. To remove −125 from the left-hand side, add 125 to both sides of the equation. 226x− 125 + 125 = 0 + 125 Add 125 to both sides. 226x = 125 Simplify both sides. Finally, to “undo” multiplying by 226, divide both sides by 226. 226x 226 = 125 226 Divide both sides by 226. x = 125 226 Simplify. Check: Let’s check the answer with the TI-84. 1. Store 125/226 in the variable X using the following keystrokes. 1 2 5 ÷ 2 2 6 STO! X,T,θ,n ENTER The result is shown in the first image in Figure 2.12. 2.

SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Figure 2.12: Checking 125/226 in 2.3x− 1.25 = 0.04x. Note that both sides yield the same decimal approximation 0.0221238938 when 125/226 is substituted for x. This guarantees that 125/226 is a solution of 2.3x− 1.25 = 0.04x.Answer: x = −43/225 ! 2.3.
