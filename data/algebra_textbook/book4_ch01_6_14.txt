Borrowing from Zero It often happens in a subtraction problem that we have to borrow from one or more zeros. This occurs in problems such as and We'll examine each case. Example 1.43. Borrowing from a single zero. Consider the problem Since we do not have a name for 3 − 7, we must borrow from 0. Since there are no tens to borrow, we must borrow 1 hundred. One hundred = 10 tens. We can now borrow 1 ten from 10 tens (leaving 9 tens). One ten = 10 ones and 10 ones + 3 ones = 13 ones. Now we can suggest the following method for borrowing from a single zero. Borrowing from a Single Zero To borrow from a single zero, Decrease the digit to the immediate left of zero by one. Draw a line through the zero and make it a 10. Proceed to subtract as usual. Sample Set E Example 1.44.  Perform this subtraction. The number 503 contains a single zero The number to the immediate left of 0 is 5. Decrease 5 by 1. 5 − 1 = 4 Draw a line through the zero and make it a 10. Borrow from the 10 and proceed. 1 ten + 10 ones 10 ones + 3 ones = 13 ones Practice Set E Perform each subtraction. Exercise 1.6.18. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.19. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.20. (Go to Solution) Example 1.45. Borrowing from a group of zeros Consider the problem In this case, we have a group of zeros. Since we cannot borrow any tens or hundreds, we must borrow 1 thousand. One thousand = 10 hundreds. We can now borrow 1 hundred from 10 hundreds. One hundred = 10 tens. We can now borrow 1 ten from 10 tens. One ten = 10 ones. From observations made in this procedure we can suggest the following method for borrowing from a group of zeros. Borrowing from a Group of zeros To borrow from a group of zeros, Decrease the digit to the immediate left of the group of zeros by one. Draw a line through each zero in the group and make it a 9, except the rightmost zero, make it 10. Proceed to subtract as usual. Sample Set F Perform each subtraction. Example 1.46.  The number 40,000 contains a group of zeros. The number to the immediate left of the group is 4. Decrease 4 by 1. 4 − 1 = 3 Make each 0, except the rightmost one, 9. Make the rightmost 0 a 10. Subtract as usual. Example 1.47.  The number 8,000,006 contains a group of zeros. The number to the immediate left of the group is 8. Decrease 8 by 1. 8 − 1 = 7 Make each zero, except the rightmost one, 9. Make the rightmost 0 a 10. To perform the subtraction, we’ll need to borrow from the ten. Practice Set F Perform each subtraction. Exercise 1.6.21. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.22. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.23.
