Humans have been solving problems of this type for thousands of years. The earliest records indicate that the problems were written entirely in words with no symbols (such as +, −, ×, ÷, and =) or numbers. For example, a problem might read “Sixteen added to an unknown number is fifty-two.” Diophantes of Alexandria wrote a series of books Arithmetica demonstrat- ing solutions to equations in which he used some abbreviations for shortcuts. In 9th century AD, al-Khwarizmi wrote the book Al-Kitab al-mukhtasar ti Hisab al-jabr w’al-muqabala, translated as The Compendious Book on Calcu- lation by Restoration and Reduction. In fact, the word “algebra” is based on the word al-Jabr from the text title. His book described the rules of “Comple- tion and Reduction” to make it easier to do arithmetic computations needed in human business interactions. In the 1600-1700’s, mathematicians began writing out equations symboli- cally as we do today using the symbols +, −, ×, and ÷ for operations and = for equals. We will be solving equations which can be solved in logical steps by using inverse operations which “undo” each other. For example, one pair of inverse operations is addition and subtraction. Another pair of inverse operations is multiplication and division. We will also be solving inequalities which may have an infinite set of answers that can be expressed in three ways: by graphing on a number line, by using set-builder notation, or by using interval notation. 73 74 CHAPTER 2.

SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES  || 2.1 Solving Equations: One Step Let’s start with the definition of an equation. Equation. An equation is a mathematical statement that equates two alge- braic expressions. The key difference between a algebraic expression and an equation is the pres- ence of an an equals sign. So, for example, 2x+ 3, x− (3− 2x), and 2(y + 3)− 3(1− y) are algebraic expressions, while 2x+ 3 = 0, x− (3− 2x) = 4, and 2(y + 3)− 3(1− y) = −11 are equations. Note that each of the equations contain an equals sign, but the algebraic expressions do not. Next we have the definition of a solution of an equation. What it Means to be a Solution of an Equation. A solution of an equation is a numerical value that satisfies the equation. That is, when the variable in the equation is replaced by the solution, a true statement results. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Show that 8 is a solution of the equation x− 12 = −4.Which of the numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is a solution of the equation 2y + 3 = 7. Solution. Substitute 8 for x in the given equation and simplify. x− 12 = −4 The given equation. 8− 12 = −4 Substitute 8 for x. −4 = −4 Simplify both sides. Since the left- and right-hand sides of the last line are equal, this shows that when 8 is substituted for x in the equation a true statement results. Therefore, 8 is a solution of the equation.Answer: 2 !  || Equivalent Equations Now that we know how to identify a solution of an equation, let’s define what it means when we say that two equations are equivalent. 2.1. SOLVING EQUATIONS: ONE STEP 75 Equivalent Equations. Two equations are equivalent if they have the same solution set. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Are the equations x− 3 = 6 and x = 9 equivalent? Are the equations x = 5 and x− 7 = 10 equivalent? Solution. The number 9 is the only solution of the equation x − 3 = 6. Similarly, 9 is the only solution of the equation x = 9. Therefore x− 3 = 6 and x = 9 have the same solution sets and are equivalent. Answer: No. ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Are the equations x2 = 1 and x = 1 equivalent? Are the equations x = 1 and x2 = x equivalent? Solution. By inspection, the equation x2 = 1 has two solutions, −1 and 1. (−1)2 = 1 and (1)2 = 1 On the other hand, the equation x = 1 has a single solution, namely 1. Hence, the equations x2 = 1 and x = 1 do not have the same solution sets and are not equivalent. Answer: No. ! As we shall soon see, equivalent equations play an important role in finding the solution of an equation.  || Wrap and Unwrap, Do and Undo Suppose that you are wrapping a gift for your cousin. You perform the following steps in order. 1. Put the gift paper on. 2. Put the tape on. 3. Put the decorative bow on. When we give the wrapped gift to our cousin, he politely unwraps the present, “undoing” each of our three steps in inverse order. 1. Take off the decorative bow. 2. Take off the tape. 3. Take off the gift paper. 76 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES This seemingly frivolous wrapping and unwrapping of a gift contains some deeply powerful mathematical ideas. Consider the mathematical expression x + 4. To evaluate this expression at a particular value of x, we would start with the given value of x, then add 4. • Let’s set x equal to the number 7. If we add 4, we arrive at the following result: 11 Now, how would we “unwrap” this result to return to our original number? We would start with our result, namely 11, then subtract 4. • Take our result from above, 11. If we subtract 4, we return to our original value of x: 7 The above discussion leads us to two extremely important observations. The inverse of addition is subtraction. If we start with a number x and add a number a, then subtracting a from the result will return us to the original number x. In symbols, x+ a− a = x. That is, subtracting a “undoes” the effect of adding a and returns us to the original number x. The inverse of subtraction is addition. If we start with a number x and subtract a number a, then adding a to the result will return us to the original number x. In symbols, x− a+ a = x. That is, adding a “undoes” the effect of subtracting a and returns us to the original number x.  || Operations that Produce Equivalent Equations In Example 1, we saw that x = 8 was a solution of the equation x − 12 = −4. Indeed, the equations x = 8 and x− 12 = −4 are equivalent equations because both have the same solution sets. In the case of the equation x − 12 = −4, it’s fairly easy to “guess” that the solution is x = 8, but as the equations become more complicated, we will want to know just what operations we can perform on the equation that will not change the solution set. The goal is to start with an equation such as x− 12 = −4, then through a series of steps that do not change the solution, arrive at the solution x = 8. 2.1. SOLVING EQUATIONS: ONE STEP 77 With these thoughts in mind, there are a number of operations that will pro- duce equivalent equations (equations with the same solution set). The first two that we will employ are adding or subtracting the same amount from both sides of an equation. Adding the Same Quantity to Both Sides of an Equation. Adding the same quantity to both sides of an equation does not change the solution set. That is, if a = b, then adding c to both sides of the equation produces the equivalent equation a+ c = b+ c. Subtracting the Same Quantity from Both Sides of an Equation. Subtracting the same quantity to both sides of an equation does not change the solution set. That is, if a = b, then subtracting c from both sides of the equation produces the equivalent equation a− c = b− c. Let’s look at an example where adding the same amount to both sides of the equation produces an equivalent equation that is the solution to the original equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve x− 7 = 12 for x. Solve for x: x− 6 = 4Solution: To undo the effect of subtracting 7, we add 7 to both sides of the equation. x− 7 = 12 Original equation. x− 7 + 7 = 12 + 7 Adding 7 to both sides of the equation produces an equivalent equation. x = 19 On the left, adding 7 “undoes” the effect of subtracting 7 and returns x. On the right, 12 + 7 = 19. Therefore, the solution of the equation is 19. 78 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Check: To check, substitute the solution 19 into the original equation. x− 7 = 12 Original equation. 19− 7 = 12 Substitute 19 for x. 12 = 12 Simplify both sides. The fact that the last line of the check is a true statement guarantees that 19 is a solution of x− 7 = 12.Answer: 10 ! In the solution of Example 4, we use the concept of the “inverse.” If we start with x, subtract 7, then add 7, we are returned to the number x. In symbols, x− 7 + 7 = x. We are returned to x because “subtracting 7” and “adding 7” are inverse operations of one another. That is, whatever one does, the other “undoes.” Next, let’s look at an example where subtracting the same amount from both sides of the equation produces an equivalent equation that is the solution to the original equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Solve x+ 2 3 = 1 2 for x.Solve for x: x+ 1 2 = 3 5 Solution: To undo the effect of adding 2/3, we subtract 2/3 from both sides of the equation. x+ 2 3 = 1 2 Original equation. x+ 2 3 − 2 3 = 1 2 − 2 3 Subtracting 2/3 from both sides produces an equivalent equation. x = 3 6 − 4 6 On the left, subtracting 2/3 “undoes” the effect of adding 2/3 and returns x. On the right, make equivalent fractions with a common denominator. x = −1 6 Subtract: 3 6 − 4 6 = −1 6 Therefore, the solution of the equation is −1/6. Check: Let’s use the TI-84 graphing calculator to check this solution. 1. Store the value −1/6 in the variable X using the following keystrokes. The result is shown in Figure 2.1. (-) 1 ÷ 6 STO! X,T,θ,n ENTER 2.1. SOLVING EQUATIONS: ONE STEP 79 2. Enter the left-hand side of the original equation: x + 2/3. Use the fol- lowing keystrokes. The result is shown in Figure 2.1. X,T,θ,n + 2 ÷ 3 ENTER Figure 2.1: Checking the solution to x+ 2/3 = 1/2. 3. Press the MATH button on your calculator (see Figure 2.2), then select 1:"Frac and press the ENTER button. This will convert the decimal result to a fraction (see Figure 2.2). Figure 2.2: Changing the result to a fraction. Note that the result is 1 2 , showing that −1 6 is a solution of x+ 2 3 = 1 2 . Answer: 1/10 !  || More Operations That Produce Equivalent Equations Here are two more operations that produce equivalent equations. Multiplying Both Sides of an Equation by a Nonzero Quantity. Mul- tiplying both sides of an equation by a nonzero quantity does not change the solution set. That is, if a = b, and c != 0, then multiplying both sides of the equation by c produces the equivalent equation ac = bc. 80 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Dividing Both Sides of an Equation by a Nonzero Quantity. Dividing both sides of an equation by a nonzero quantity does not change the solution set. That is, if a = b, and c != 0, then dividing both sides of the equation by c produces the equivalent equation a c = b c . Like addition and subtraction, multiplication and division are inverse opera- tions. The inverse of multiplication is division. If we start with a number x and multiply by a number a, then dividing the result by the same number a returns us to the original number x. In symbols, a · x a = x. That is, dividing by a “undoes” the effect of multiplying by a and returns us to the original number x. The inverse of division is multiplication. If we start with a number x and divide by a number a, then multiplying the result by the same number a returns us to the original number x. In symbols, a · x a = x. That is, multiplying by a “undoes” the effect of dividing by a and returns us to the original number x. Let’s look at an example where dividing both sides of the equation by the same amount produces an equivalent equation that is the solution to the original equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Solve −2.1x = 0.42 for x.Solve for x: −3.6x = 0.072 Solution: To undo the effect of multiplying by −2.1, we divide both sides of 2.1. SOLVING EQUATIONS: ONE STEP 81 the equation by −2.1. −2.1x = 0.42 Original equation. −2.1x −2.1 = 0.42 −2.1 Dividing both sides by −2.1produces an equivalent equation. x = −2 On the left, dividing by −2.1 “undoes” the effect of multiplying by −2.1 and returns x. On the right, divide: 0.42/(−2.1) = −2. Therefore, the solution of the equation is −2. Check: To check, substitute the solution −2 into the original equation. −2.1x = 0.42 Original equation. −2.1(−2) = 0.42 Substitute −2 for x. 0.42 = 0.42 On the left, multiply: −2.1(−2) = 0.42 The fact that the last line of the check is a true statement guarantees that −2 is a solution of −2.1x = 0.42. Answer: −0.02 ! Next, lets look at an example where multiplying both sides of the equation by the same amount produces an equivalent equation that is the solution to the original equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Solve x 5 = −10 for x. Solve for x: x 7 = −2Solution: To undo the effect of dividing by 5, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5. x 5 = −10 Original equation. 5 [x 5 ] = [−10] 5 Multiplying both sides by 5 produces an equivalent equation. x = −50 On the left, multiplying by 5 “undoes” the effect of dividing by 5 and returns x. On the right, multiply: [−10]5 = −50. Therefore, the solution of the equation is −50. Check: Let’s use the TI-84 graphing calculator to check this solution. 1. Store the value −50 in the variable X using the following keystrokes. The result is shown in Figure 2.3. (-) 5 0 STO! X,T,θ,n ENTER 82 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES 2. Enter the left-hand side of the original equation: x 5 . Use the following keystrokes. X,T,θ,n ÷ 5 ENTER The result is shown in Figure 2.3. Figure 2.3: Checking the solution to x/5 = −10. Note that the result is −10, showing that −50 is a solution of x/5 = −10.Answer: −14 !  || Writing Mathematics When solving equations, observe the following rules when presenting your work. 1. One equation per line. This means that you should not arrange your work horizontally as follows: x+ 3 = 7 x+ 3− 3 = 7− 3 x = 4 That’s three equations on a line. Instead, work vertically, writing one equation per line. In the following presentation, note how we align the equal signs in a column. x+ 3 = 7 x+ 3− 3 = 7− 3 x = 4 2.1. SOLVING EQUATIONS: ONE STEP 83 2. Add and subtract inline. Do not add 7 to both sides of the equation in the following manner: x− 7 = 12 + 7 +7 x= 19 Instead, add 7 “inline” to both sides of the equation as follows: x− 7 = 12 x− 7 + 7 = 12 + 7 x = 19 84 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES ! ! !  || 2.2 Solving Equations: Multiple Steps Recall the “Wrap” and “Unwrap” discussion from Section 2.1. To wrap a present we put the gift paper on, put the tape on, and put the decorative bow on. To unwrap the gift, we must “undo” each of these steps in inverse order. Hence, to unwrap the gift we take off the decorative bow, take off the tape, and take off the gift paper. Now, imagine a machine that multiplies its input by 3, then adds 5 to the result. This machine is pictured on the left in Figure 2.4. 1. Multiply by 3. 2. Add 5. x 1. Subtract 5. 2. Divide by 3. x Figure 2.4: The second machine “unwraps” the first machine. To “unwrap” the effect of the machine on the left, we need a machine that will “undo” each of the steps of the first machine, but in inverse order. The “unwrapping” machine is pictured on the right in Figure 2.4. It will first sub- tract 5 from its input, then divide the result by 3. Note that each of these operations “undoes” the corresponding operation of the first machine, but in inverse order. The following argument shows that the second machine “undoes” the op- eration of the first machine. 1. Drop the integer 4 into the machine on the left in Figure 2.4. This ma- chine will first multiply 4 by 3, then add 5 to the result. The result is 3(4) + 5, or 17. 2. To “unwrap” this result, drop 17 into the machine on the right. This machine first subtracts 5, then divides the result by 3. The result is (17− 5)/3, or 4, the original integer that was put into the first machine. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve for x: 3x+ 5 = 14 Solve for x: 2x+ 3 = 7Solution: On the left, order of operations demands that we first multiply x by 3, then add 5. To solve this equation for x, we must “undo” each of these operations in inverse order. Thus, we will first subtract 5 from both sides of 88 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES the equation, then divide both sides by 3. 3x+ 5 = 14 Original equation. 3x+ 5− 5 = 14− 5 To “undo” adding 5, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. 3x = 9 Simplify both sides. 3x 3 = 9 3 To “undo” multiplying by 3, divide both sides of the equation by 3. x = 3 Simplify both sides. Check: To check the solution, substitute 3 for x in the original equation and simplify. 3x+ 5 = 14 Original equation. 3(3) + 5 = 14 Substitute 3 for x. 9 + 5 = 14 Multiply first: 3(3) = 9. 14 = 14 Add: 9 + 5 = 14. Because the last line of the check is a true statement, this guarantees that 3 is a solution of the original equation.Answer: x = 2 ! Let’s try an equation with fractions. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Solve for x: x 5 − 2 3 = 1 2Solve for x: x 2 − 3 5 = 1 4 Solution: On the left, order of operations demands that we first divide x by 5, then subtract 2/3. To solve this equation for x, we must “undo” each of these operations in inverse order. Thus, we will first add 2/3 to both sides of the equation, then multiply both sides of the resulting equation by 5. x 5 − 2 3 = 1 2 Original equation. x 5 − 2 3 + 2 3 = 1 2 + 2 3 To “undo” subtracting 2/3, add 2/3 to both sides of the equation. On the left, we simplify. On the right, we make equivalent fractions with a common denominator. x 5 = 3 6 + 4 6 Make equivalent fractions x 5 = 7 6 Add: 3 6 + 4 6 = 7 6 . 2.2. SOLVING EQUATIONS: MULTIPLE STEPS 89 Now we “undo” dividing by five by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5. 5 (x 5 ) = 5 ( 7 6 ) Multiply both sides by 5. x = 35 6 On the left, simplify. On the right, multiply: 5 ( 7 6 ) = 35 6 . Check: Let’s use the TI-84 to check this solution. 1. Store the value 35/6 in the variable X using the following keystrokes. 3 5 ÷ 6 STO! X,T,θ,n ENTER The result is shown in Figure 2.5. 2. Enter the left-hand side of the original equation: x/5 − 2/3. Use the following keystrokes.

Let’s try an equation with decimals. 90 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Solve for x: 5.2x+ 2.3 = −3.94Solve for x: 3.25− 1.2x = 0.37 Solution: On the left, order of operations demands that we first multiply x by 5.2, then add 2.3. To solve this equation for x, we must “undo” each of these operations in inverse order. Thus, we will first subtract 2.3 from both sides of the equation, then divide both sides by 5.2. 5.2x+ 2.3 = −3.94 Original equation. 5.2x+ 2.3− 2.3 = −3.94− 2.3 To “undo” adding 2.3, subtract 2.3 from both sides. 5.2x = −6.24 On the left, simplify. On the right, add: −3.94− 2.3 = −6.24. 5.2x 5.2 = −6.24 5.2 To “undo” multiplying by 5.2, divide both sides by 5.2. x = −1.2 On the left, simplify. On the right, divide: −6.24/5.2 = −1.2. Check: To check the solution, substitute −1.2 for x in the original equation and simplify. 5.2x+ 2.3 = −3.94 Original equation. 5.2(−1.2) + 2.3 = −3.94 Substitute −1.2 for x. −6.24 + 2.3 = −3.94 Multiply: 5.2(−1.2) = −6.24. −3.94 = −3.94 Add: −6.24 + 2.3 = −3.94. Because the last line of the check is a true statement, this guarantees that −1.2 is a solution of the original equation.Answer: x = 2.4 !  || Variables on Both Sides of the Equation It is not uncommon that the variable you are solving for appears in terms on both sides of the equation. Consider, for example, the equation 2x+3 = 5−7x. In cases like this, it is helpful to have a general understanding of what it means to “solve for x.” Solve for x. When asked to solve an equation for x, the goal is to manipulate the equation into the final form x = “Stuff”, 2.2. SOLVING EQUATIONS: MULTIPLE STEPS 91 where “Stuff” is a valid mathematical expression that may contain other vari- ables, mathematical symbols, etc., but it must not contain any occurrence of the variable x. In this section, “Stuff” will always be a single number, but in Section 2.4, Formulae, “Stuff” will take on added complexity, including variables other than x. Strategy for solving for x. When asked to solve an equation for x, a common strategy is to isolate all terms containing the variable x on one side of the equation and move all terms not containing the variable x to the other side of the equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve 3− 2x = 5x+ 9 for x. Solve for x: 4x+ 7 = 5− 8xSolution: We need to isolate all terms containing x on one side of the equation. We can eliminate 5x from the right-hand side of 3−2x = 5x+9 by subtracting 5x from both sides of the equation. 3− 2x = 5x+ 9 Original equation. 3− 2x− 5x = 5x+ 9− 5x Subtract 5x from both sides. 3− 7x = 9 Simplify both sides. Next, eliminate 3 from the left-hand side of the last equation by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation. 3− 7x− 3 = 9− 3 Subtract 3 from both sides. −7x = 6 Simplify both sides. Note how we have isolated all terms containing x on one side of the equation. −7x −7 = 6 −7 Divide both sides by −7. x = −6 7 Simplify both sides. 92 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Check: To check the solution, substitute −6/7 for x in the original equation. 3− 2x = 5x+ 9 Original equation. 3− 2 ( −6 7 ) = 5 ( −6 7 ) + 9 Substitute −6/7 for x. 3 + 12 7 = −30 7 + 9 Multiply: −2(−6/7) = 12/7 and 5(−6/7) = −30/7. 21 7 + 12 7 = −30 7 + 63 7 Make equivalent fractions with a common denominator. 33 7 = 33 7 Add. Because the last line of the check is a true statement, this guarantees that −6/7 is a solution of the original equation.Answer: x = −1/6 !  || Simplifying Expressions When Solving Equations Sometimes we need to simplify expressions before we can isolate terms contain- ing x. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Solve for x: 2(3x+ 1)− 3(4− 2x) = −34Solve for x: 2x− (x− 2) = 2(x+ 7) Solution: We’ll first simplify the expression on the left-hand side of the equation using the Rules Guiding Order of Operations. 2(3x+ 1)− 3(4− 2x) = −34 Original equation. 6x+ 2− 12 + 6x = −34 Multiply: 2(3x+ 1) = 6x+ 2. Multiply: −3(4− 2x) = −12 + 6x. 12x− 10 = −34 Add: 6x+ 6x = 12x. Add: 2− 12 = −10. To “undo” subtracting 10, we add 10 to both sides of the equation. 12x− 10 + 10 = −34 + 10 Add 10 to both sides. 12x = −24 Simplify both sides. To “undo” multiplying by 12, we divide both sides by 12. 12x 12 = −24 12 Divide both sides by 12. x = −2 Simplify both sides. Check: Let’s use the TI-84 to check this solution. 2.2.

Note that when −2 is substituted for x in the left-hand of the equation, the result is −34, equalling the right-hand side of the equation. Thus, the solution −2 checks. Answer: x = −12 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Solve for x: 2x− 5(3− 2x) = 4(x− 1) Solve for x: 5(1− x) = 2(x+ 3)− (x− 1)Solution: We’ll first simplify the expressions on each side of the equation using the Rules Guiding Order of Operations. 2x− 5(3− 2x) = 4(x− 1) Original equation. 2x− 15 + 10x = 4x− 4 On the left, distribute the −5. On the right, distribute the 4. 12x− 15 = 4x− 4 On the left, add: 2x+ 10x = 12x 94 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Next, we need to isolate terms containing the variable x on one side of the equation. To remove the term 4x from the right-hand side, we subtract 4x from both sides of the equation. 12x− 15− 4x = 4x− 4− 4x Subtract 4x from both sides. 8x− 15 = −4 Simplify both sides. To remove the term −15 from the left-hand side, we add 15 to both sides of the equation. 8x− 15 + 15 = −4 + 15 Add 15 to both sides. 8x = 11 Simplify both sides. Finally, to “undo” multiplying by 8, we divide both sides by 8. 8x 8 = 11 8 Divide both sides by 8. x = 11 8 Simplify both sides. Check: Let’s use the TI-84 to check this solution. 1.

SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES ! ! !  || 2.3 Clearing Fractions and Decimals In this section we introduce techniques that clear fractions and decimals from equations, making the resulting equation a lot easier to solve. When clearing fractions from an equation, you will need to simplify products like the ones posed in the following examples. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify: 12 ( 2 3 x ) . Simplify: 15 ( 3 5 x )Solution: When we multiply three numbers, such as 12, 2/3, and x, the associative property of multiplication tells us that it does not matter which two numbers we multiply first. We use the associative property to regroup, then multiply numerators and denominators and simplify the result. 12 ( 2 3 x ) = ( 12 · 2 3 ) x Associative property of multiplication. = 24 3 x Multiply: 12 · 2 = 24. = 8x Divide: 24/3 = 8. Answer: 9x ! Example 1 shows all of the steps involved in arriving at the answer. How- ever, the goal in this section is to perform this calculation mentally. So we just “Multiply 12 and 2 to get 24, then divide 24 by 3 to get 8.” This approach allows us to write down the answer without doing any work. 12 ( 2 3 x ) = 8x You should practice this mental calculation until you can write down the answer without writing down any steps. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Simplify: 18 ( 2 9 x ) Simplify: 14 ( 3 7 x )Solution: This time we perform the calculations mentally. Multiply 18 and 2 to get 36, then divide 36 by 9 to get 4. 18 ( 2 9 x ) = 4x Answer: 6x ! 100 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES When the numbers get larger, the mental calculations become harder. For example, consider 72 ( 8 9 x ) In this case, the work “multiply 72 and 8 to get 576, then divide 576 by 9 to get 64” is a bit difficult to carry in your head. However, this is when the calculator comes to the rescue. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Use your calculator to help simplify 72 ( 8 9 x ) . Use your calculator to simplify: 81 ( 5 9 x ) Solution: Use your calculator to multiply 72 and 8, then divide by 9. Enter 72*8/9 and press the ENTER key. Thus, 72 ( 8 9 x ) = 64x. Answer: 45x !  || Canceling is More Efficient In Examples 1, 2, and 3, we multiplied numerators, then divided by the sole denominator. We also saw that it is a bit difficult to carry the work in our head as the numbers grow larger. In Chapter 1, Section 3, we saw that canceling reduces the size of the numbers and simplifies the work. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify: 72 ( 8 9 x ) . Simplify: 64 ( 5 8 x ) Solution: In Example 3, we used our calculator to multiply 72 and 8 to get 576, then divided 576 by 9 to get 64. In this solution, we divide 9 into 72 to get 8, then multiply 8 by 8 to get 64. We get the same answer, but because the intermediate numbers are much smaller, the calculations are much easier to do mentally. 2.3. CLEARING FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 101 72 ( 8 9 x ) = ( 72 · 8 9 ) x Associative property of multiplication. = (8 · 8)x Divide: 72/9 = 8. = 64x Multiply: 8 · 8 = 64. Answer: 40x ! Example 4 shows all of the steps involved in arriving at the answer. Again, the goal in this section is to perform this calculation mentally, so we just “Divide 9 into 72 to get 8, then multiply 8 by 8 to get 644.” 72 ( 8 9 x ) = 64x Not only does this approach allow us to write down the answer without doing any work, the numerical calculations involve smaller numbers. You should practice this mental calculation until you can write down the answer without writing down any steps. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify: 27 ( 5 9 x ) . Simplify: 18 ( 3 2 x )Solution: Divide 9 into 27 to get 3, then multiply 3 by 5 to get 15. 27 ( 5 9 x ) = 15x Answer: 27x ! Note: The technique shown in Examples 4 and 5 is the technique we’ll use in the remainder of this section. Dividing (canceling) first is far more efficient, the smaller numbers allowing us to perform the calculation mentally.  || Clearing Fractions from an Equation Now that we’ve done the required fraction work, we can now concentrate on clearing fractions from an equation. Once the fractions are removed from the equation, the resulting equivalent equation is far easier to solve than the orig- inal. Clearing fractions from an equation. To clear fractions from an equation, multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator. 102 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Solve for x: x+ 2 3 = 1 2 .Solve for x: x− 3 4 = 1 2 Solution: The common denominator for 2/3 and 1/2 is 6. We begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 6. x+ 2 3 = 1 2 Original equation. 6 ( x+ 2 3 ) = 6 ( 1 2 ) Multiply both sides by 6. 6x+ 6 ( 2 3 ) = 6 ( 1 2 ) On the left, distribute the 6. To simplify 6(2/3), divide 6 by 3 to get 2, then multiply 2 by 2 to get 4. Thus, 6(2/3) = 4. Similarly, 6(1/2) = 3. 6x+ 4 = 3 Multiply: 6 ( 2 3 ) = 4, 6 ( 1 2 ) = 3. Note that the fractions are now cleared from the equation. To isolate terms containing x on one side of the equation, subtract 4 from both sides of the equation. 6x+ 4− 4 = 3− 4 Subtract 4 from both sides. 6x = −1 Simplify both sides. To “undo” multiplying by 6, divide both sides by 6. 6x 6 = −1 6 Divide both sides by 6. x = −1 6 Simplify both sides. Check: Let’s use the TI-84 to check the solution. 1. Store −1/6 in the variable X using the following keystrokes. (-) 1 ÷ 6 STO! X,T,θ,n ENTER The result is shown in the first line in Figure 2.9. 2.

The result is shown in the third line in Figure 2.9. Figure 2.9: Checking that −1/6 is a solution of x+ 2/3 = 1/2. The result is identical to the right-hand side of the equation x + 2/3 = 1/2. Thus, the solution checks. Answer: x = 5/4 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Solve for x: 4 5 x = −4 3 . Solve for x: −3 7 x = 3 2 Solution: The common denominator for 4/5 and −4/3 is 15. We begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 15. 4 5 x = −4 3 Original equation. 15 ( 4 5 x ) = 15 ( −4 3 ) Multiply both sides by 15. To simplify 15(4/5), divide 5 into 15 to get 3, then multiply 3 by 4 to get 12. Thus, 15(4/5) = 12. Similarly, 15(−4/3) = −20 12x = −20 Multiply. To “undo” multiplying by 12, we divide both sides by 12. 12x 12 = −20 12 Divide both sides by 12. x = −5 3 Reduce to lowest terms. 104 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Check: To check, substitute −5/3 for x in the original equation. 4 5 x = −4 3 Original equation. 4 5 ( −5 3 ) = −4 3 Substitute −5/3 for x. −20 15 = −4 3 Multiply numerators and denominators. −4 3 = −4 3 Reduce. The fact that the last line is a true statement guarantees the −5/3 is a solution of the equation 4 5 x = −4 3 .Answer: x = −7/2 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Solve for x: 2x 3 − 3 4 = 1 2 − 3x 4 .Solve for x: 5x 9 − 2 3 = 5 9 − 3x 2 Solution: The common denominator for 2x/3, −3/4, 1/2, and −3x/4 is 12. We begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 12. 2x 3 − 3 4 = 1 2 − 3x 4 Original equation. 12 ( 2x 3 − 3 4 ) = 12 ( 1 2 − 3x 4 ) Multiply both sides by 12. 12 ( 2x 3 ) − 12 ( 3 4 ) = 12 ( 1 2 ) − 12 ( 3x 4 ) Distribute the 12 on each side. To simplify 12(2x/3), divide 3 into 12 to get 4, then multiply 4 by 2x to get 8x. Thus, 12(2x/3) = 8x. Similarly, 12(3/4) = 9, 12(1/2) = 6, and 12(3x/4) = 9x. 8x− 9 = 6− 9x Multiply. Note that the fractions are now cleared from the equation. We now need to isolate terms containing x on one side of the equation. To remove the term −9x from the right-hand side, add 9x to both sides of the equation. 8x− 9 + 9x = 6− 9x+ 9x Add 9x to both sides. 17x− 9 = 6 Simplify both sides. To remove the term −9 from the left-hand side, add 9 to both sides of the equation. 17x− 9 + 9 = 6 + 9 Add 9 to both sides. 17x = 15 Simplify both sides. 2.3. CLEARING FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 105 Finally, to “undo” multiplying by 17, divide both sides of the equation by 17. 17x 17 = 15 17 Divide both sides by 17. x = 15 17 Simplify both sides. Check: Let’s use the TI-84 to check the solution. 1. Store the number 15/17 in the variable X using the following keystrokes. 1 5 ÷ 1 7 STO! X,T,θ,n ENTER The result is shown in Figure 2.10.

Use the following keystrokes. 1 ÷ 2 − 3 × X,T,θ,n ÷ 4 ENTER The result is shown in the second image in Figure 2.11. Because both sides simplify to −.1617647059 when 15/17 is substituted for x, this guarantees that 15/17 is a solution of the equation 2x/3−3/4 = 1/2−3x/4. Answer: x = 22/37 ! 106 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Figure 2.11: Checking 15/17 in 2x/3− 3/4 = 1/2− 3x/4.  || Clearing Decimals from an Equation Multiplying by the appropriate power of ten will clear the decimals from an equation, making the resulting equivalent equation far easier to solve. Before we begin, first recall the following facts about multiplying by powers of ten. • 10(1.2345) = 12.345. Multiplying by 10 moves the decimal point one place to the right. • 100(1.2345) = 123.45. Multiplying by 100 moves the decimal point two places to the right. • 1000(1.2345) = 1234.5. Multiplying by 1000 moves the decimal point three places to the right. Note the pattern: The number of zeros in the power of ten determines the number of places to move the decimal point. So, for example, if we multiply by 1,000,000, which has six zeros, this will move the decimal point six places to the right. You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Solve for x: 2.3x− 1.25 = 0.04x.Solve for x: 1.34− 4.5x = 2.2 Solution: The first term of 2.3x − 1.25 = 0.04x has one decimal place, the second term has two decimal places, and the third and final term has two decimal places. At a minimum, we need to move each decimal point two places to the right in order to clear the decimals from the equation. Consequently, we multiply both sides of the equation by 100. 2.3x− 1.25 = 0.04x Original equation. 100(2.3x− 1.25) = 100(0.04x) Multiply both sides by 100. 100(2.3x)− 100(1.25) = 100(0.04x) Distribute the 100. 230x− 125 = 4x Multiplying by 100 moves all decimal points two places to the right. 2.3. CLEARING FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 107 Note that the decimals are now cleared from the equation. We must now isolate all terms containing x on one side of the equation. To remove the term 4x from the right-hand side, subtract 4x from both sides of the equation. 230x− 125− 4x = 4x− 4x Subtract 4x from both sides. 226x− 125 = 0 Simplify. To remove −125 from the left-hand side, add 125 to both sides of the equation. 226x− 125 + 125 = 0 + 125 Add 125 to both sides. 226x = 125 Simplify both sides. Finally, to “undo” multiplying by 226, divide both sides by 226. 226x 226 = 125 226 Divide both sides by 226. x = 125 226 Simplify. Check: Let’s check the answer with the TI-84. 1.

Note that both sides yield the same decimal approximation 0.0221238938 when 125/226 is substituted for x. This guarantees that 125/226 is a solution of 2.3x− 1.25 = 0.04x.Answer: x = −43/225 ! 2.3.

Indeed, formulae in science typically use several letters. For example, Isaac Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation says that the magnitude of the force of attraction between two celestial bodies is given by the formula F = GMm r2 , where m usually denotes the mass of the smaller body, M the mass of the larger body, and r is the distance between the two bodies. The letter G represents the universal gravitational constant, having value 6.67428× 10−11 N(m/kg)2. Variable case. Note the use of upper and lower case letter M’s in Newton’s Law of Gravitation. When working with scientific formulae, you must maintain the case of the given letters. You are not allowed to substitute lower for upper case, or upper for lower case in your work. In Section 2.2, we described the goal that must be met when we are asked to “solve an equation for x.” Solve for x. When asked to solve an equation for x, the goal is to manipulate the equation into the final form x = “Stuff”, where “Stuff” is a valid mathematical expression that may contain other vari- ables, mathematical symbols, etc., but it must not contain any occurrence of the variable x. Thus, to solve an equation for x, we need to isolate the terms containing x on one side of the equation, and all remaining terms on the other side of the equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve for x: x+ a = b. Solve for x: x− c = dSolution: To undo the effects of adding a, subtract a from both sides of the equation. x+ a = b Original equation. x+ a− a = b − a Subtract a from both sides. x = b − a Simplify.

Solve for a: x+ a = b.Solve for x: x− c = d Solution: We are instructed to solve the equation x+a = b for a. This means that our final answer must have the form a = “Stuff”, where “Stuff” is a valid mathematical expression that contains other variables, mathematical symbols, etc., but it does not contain any occurrence of the variable a. This means that we must isolate all terms containing the variable a on one side of the equation, and all remaining terms on the other side of the equation. Now, to undo the effect of adding x, subtract x from both sides of the equation. x+ a = b Original equation. x+ a− x = b− x Subtract x from both sides. a = b− x Simplify.

This means that our final answer must have the form k = “Stuff”, where “Stuff” is a valid mathematical expression that may contain other variables, mathematical symbols, etc., but it may not contain any occurrence of the variable k. This means that we must isolate all terms containing the variable k on one side of the equation, and all remaining terms on the other side of the equation. However, note that all terms containing the variable k are already isolated on one side of the equation. Terms not containing the variable k are isolated on the other side of the equation.

This means that our final answer must have the form R = “Stuff”, where “Stuff” is a valid mathematical expression that may contain other variables, mathematical symbols, etc., but it may not contain any occurrence of the variable R. This means that we must isolate all terms containing the variable R on one side of the equation, and all remaining terms on the other side of the equation. However, note that all terms containing the variable R are already isolated on one side of the equation. Terms not containing the variable R are isolated on the other side of the equation.

For example, the problem might ask for Jane’s age, but your equation’s solution gives the age of Jane’s sister Liz. Make sure you answer the original question asked in the problem. Your solution should be written in a sentence with appropriate units. 5. Look Back. It is important to note that this step does not imply that you should simply check your solution in your equation. After all, it’s possible that your equation incorrectly models the problem’s situation, so you could have a valid solution to an incorrect equation. The important question is: “Does your answer make sense based on the words in the original problem statement.” Let’s give these requirements a test drive. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1.

SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Three more than five times a certain number is −62 3 + 5x = −62 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for x, first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation. 3 + 5x = −62 Original equation. 3 + 5x− 3 = −62− 3 Subtract 3 from both sides. 5x = −65 Simplify. 5x 5 = −65 5 Divide both sides by 5. x = −13 Simplify. 4. Answer the Question. The unknown number is −13. 5. Look Back. Compute “three more than five times −13.” 3 + 5(−13) = 3 + (−65) = −62 Hence, three more than five times −13 is −62, as required.

These are not the integers we seek, but they serve to help in the understanding of the problem. Note how each consecutive integer is one larger than the preceding integer. If k is the smallest of three consecutive integers, then the next two consecutive integers are k+1 and k+2. The “sum of three consecutive integers is −66” becomes: 2.5. APPLICATIONS 123 First consecutive integer plus second consecutive integer plus third consecutive integer is −66 k + (k + 1) + (k + 2) = −66 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for k, first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms. k + (k + 1) + (k + 2) = −66 Original equation. 3k + 3 = −66 Combine like terms. 3k + 3− 3 = −66− 3 Subtract 3 from both sides. 3k = −69 Simplify. 3k 3 = −69 3 Divide both sides by 3. k = −23 Simplify. 4. Answer the Question. The smallest of three consecutive integers is −23. 5. Look Back. If k = −23 is the smallest of three consecutive integers, then the next two consecutive integers are −22 and −21. Let’s check the sum of these three consecutive integers. −23 + (−22) + (−21) = −66 Hence, the sum of the three consecutive integers is −66, as required. Our solution is correct.

The second piece is twice as long as the first piece, and the third piece is 30 inches longer than the second piece. Find the length of each piece cut by Han. The second piece is twice as long as the first piece, and the third piece is three times as long as the first piece. Find the length of each piece cut by the carpenter. Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Let L represent the length of the first piece. Then the second piece, which is twice as long as the first piece, has length 2L. The third piece, which is three times as long as the first piece, has length 3L. Let’s construct a little table to help summarize the information provided in this problem. 124 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Piece Length (in) First piece L Second piece 2L Third piece 3L Total length 60 2. Set up an Equation. As you can see in the table above, the second column shows that the sum of the three pieces is 60 inches. In symbols: L+ 2L+ 3L = 60 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for L, first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms. L+ 2L+ 3L = 60 Original equation. 6L = 60 Combine like terms. 6L 6 = 60 6 Divide both sides by 6. L = 10 Simplify. 4. Answer the Question. The first piece has length L = 10 inches. The second piece has length 2L = 20 inches. The third piece has length 3L = 30 inches.

APPLICATIONS 125 Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. An example of three consecutive even integers is 18, 20, and 22. These are not the integers we seek, but they do give us some sense of the meaning of three consecutive even integers. Note that each consecutive even integer is two larger than the preceding integer. Thus, if k is the length of the first side of the triangle, then the next two sides are k+2 and k+4. In this example, our variable dictionary will take the form of a well-labeled figure. k + 2 kk + 4 2. Set up an Equation. The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the three sides. If the perimeter is 156 centimeters, then: k + (k + 2) + (k + 4) = 156 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for k, first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms. k + (k + 2) + (k + 4) = 156 Original equation. 3k + 6 = 156 Combine like terms. 3k + 6− 6 = 156− 6 Subtract 6 from both sides. 3k = 150 Simplify. 3k 3 = 150 3 Divide both sides by 3. k = 50 Simplify. 4. Answer the Question. Thus, the first side has length 50 centimeters. Because the next two consecutive even integers are k+2 = 52 and k+4 = 54, the three sides of the triangle measure 50, 52, and 54 centimeters, respectively. 5. Look Back.

The third angle of the triangle is a 40 degrees larger than the second angle. How many degrees are in each angle? of the angles of a triangle is 180◦. Suppose we have a triangle whose second angle is 10 degrees larger than twice its first angle and whose third angle is 50 degrees larger than its first angle. Find the measure of each angle of the triangle. Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. The Greek alphabet starts out with the letters α, β, γ, δ, (, . . . , in much the same way that the English alphabet start out with the letters a, b, c, d, e, . . . . Mathematicians love to use Greek letters, especially in the study of trigonometry. The greek letter θ (pronounced “theta”) is particularly favored in representing an angle of a triangle. So, we’ll let θ represent the degree measure of the first angle of the triangle. The second angle is 10 degrees larger than twice the first angle, so the second angle is 2θ+10. The third angle is 50 degrees larger than the first angle, so the third angle is θ + 50. Again, we’ll set up a well-labeled figure for our variable dictionary. θ + 50θ 2θ + 10 2.5. APPLICATIONS 127 2. Set up an Equation. The sum of the angles is 180◦, so: θ + (2θ + 10) + (θ + 50) = 180 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for θ, first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms. θ + (2θ + 10) + (θ + 50) = 180 Original equation. 4θ + 60 = 180 Combine like terms. 4θ + 60− 60 = 180− 60 Subtract 60 from both sides. 4θ = 120 Simplify. 4θ 4 = 120 4 Divide both sides by 4. θ = 30 Simplify. 4. Answer the Question. Thus, the first angle is θ = 30 degrees, the second angle is 2θ+10 = 70 degrees, and the third angle is θ +50 = 80 degrees. 5. Look Back. An image helps our understanding. Note that the second angle is 10 degrees larger than twice the first angle. Note that the third angle is 50 degrees larger than the first angle. 80◦30◦ 70◦ Note that the sum of the angles is: 30◦ + 70◦ + 80◦ = 180◦ (2.2) Thus, the sum of the three angles is 180 degrees, as it should be.

How much did she invest in each account? Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. We’ll use a table in this example to help set up our variable dictionary. Let x be the amount invested in the first account. The amount invested in the second account is twice that invested in the first account, so 2x is the amount invested in the second account. The third account investment is $1,000 more than the amount invested in the second account, so that is 2x+ 1000. Account # Amount Invested Account#1 x Account#2 2x Account#3 2x+ 1000 Total Invested 21000 2. Set up an Equation. The second column of the table reveals the required equation. The three investments must sum to $21,000. x+ 2x+ (2x+ 1000) = 21000 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for x, first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms. x+ 2x+ (2x+ 1000) = 21000 Original equation. 5x+ 1000 = 21000 Combine like terms. 5x+ 1000− 1000 = 21000− 1000 Subtract 1000 from both sides. 5x = 20000 Simplify. 5x 5 = 20000 5 Divide both sides by 5. x = 4000 Simplify. 4. Answer the Question. Substitute x = 4000 in each entry of the second column of the table above to produce the results in the table below. Account # Amount Invested Amount Invested Account#1 x $4,000 Account#2 2x $8,000 Account#3 2x+ 1000 $9,000 Total Invested 21000 $21,000 2.5. APPLICATIONS 129 5. Look Back. As we can see in our answer table, the amount $8,000 invested in the second account is twice the amount invested in the first account. The amount $9,000 invested in the third account is %1,000 more than the amount invested in the second account. Moreover, the total investment is: $4, 000 + $8, 000 + $9, 000 = $21, 000 (2.3) Thus, the total investment is $21,000, as it should be. We have the correct solution.

If Magaret is four times as far from the start of the ride as she is from the finish, how many more miles does she have to go before she finishes her ride? to Canada. Shortly before he crosses over from Oregon into Washington he is four times as far from the beginning of the trail as he is from the end. How much further does he have to hike? Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Let d represent the distance left for Jeff to hike. Because Jeff is four times further from the beginning of the trail than the end, the distance Jeff already completed is 4d. Let’s construct a little table to help summarize the information provided in this problem. Section of Trail Distance (mi) Distance to finish d Distance from start 4d Total distance 2650 2. Set up an Equation. As you can see in the table above, the second column shows that the sum of the two distances is 2650 miles. In symbols: d+ 4d = 2650 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for d, first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms. d+ 4d = 2650 Original equation. 5d = 2650 Combine like terms. 5d 5 = 2650 5 Divide both sides by 5. d = 530 Simplify. 130 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES 4. Answer the Question. Jeff still has 530 miles to hike. 5. Look Back. Because the amount left to hike is d = 530 miles, Jeff’s distance from the start of the trail is 4d = 4(530), or 2,120 miles. If we arrange these results in tabular form, it is evident that not only is the distance from the start of the trail four times that of the distance left to the finish, but also the sum of their lengths is equal to the total length of the trail. Section of Trail Distance (mi) Distance (mi) Distance to finish d 530 Distance from start 4d 2120 Total distance 2650 2650 Thus, we have the correct solution.Answer: 20 miles ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8.

Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Let S represent the actual size of Sister Damaris’ class. 2. Set up an Equation. If 15% of Sister Damaris’ class was absent, then 85% of her class was present. There are 34 student present, so the phrase “85% of Sister Damaris’ class is 34” translates into the equation, 0.85S = 34, where we’ve changed 85% to a decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the left. 3. Solve the Equation. To solve for S, first clear the decimals by multiplying both sides of the equation by 100. 0.85S = 34 Original equation. 85S = 3400 Multiply both sides by 100. 85S 85 = 3400 85 Divide both sides by 85. S = 40 Simplify. 2.5. APPLICATIONS 131 4. Answer the Question. Sister Damaris’ class size is 40. 5. Look Back. We’re told that 15% of Sister Damaris’ class is absent. If we calculate 15% of 40, we get: 0.15(40) = 6 Thus, there were 6 students absent, so 40−6, or 34 students were present. Thus, we have the correct solution. Answer: 45 ! 132 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES ! ! !  || 2.6 Inequalities In Chapter 1, we introduced the natural numbers N = {1, 2, 3, . . .}, the whole numbersW = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}, and the integers Z = {. . . ,−3,−2,−1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}. Later in the chapter, we introduced the rational numbers, numbers of the form p/q, where p and q are integers. We noted that both terminating and repeating decimals are rational numbers. Each of these numbers has a unique position on the number line (see Figure 2.13). −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 −2 1.5−3.125 0.3 329− 78 Figure 2.13: Positioning numbers on the number line. The natural numbers, whole numbers, and integers are also rational num- bers, because each can be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers. For example, 0=0/12, 4 = 4/1, and −3 = −12/4. Indeed, the rational numbers contain all of the numbers we’ve studied up to this point in the course. However, not all numbers are rational numbers. For example, consider the Two other irrational numbers you may encounter in your mathematical studies are e (Euler’s constant), which is approximately equal to e ≈ 2.71828182845904 . . ., and φ (pronounced “phi”), called the golden ratio, which equals φ = (1 + √ 5)/2. The number e arises in applications involving compound interest, probability, and other areas of mathematics. The number φ is used in financial markets and is also arguably the ratio of beauty in art and architecture. decimal number −3.10110111011110 . . ., which neither terminates nor repeats. The number √ 2 = 1.414213562373095 . . . also equals a decimal number that never terminates and never repeats. A similar statement can be made about the number pi = 3.141592653589793 . . ..

Figure 2.14: Positioning numbers on the number line. The Real Numbers. If we combine all of the rational and irrational numbers into one collection, then we have a set of numbers that is called the set of real numbers. The set of real numbers is denoted by the symbol R. Every point on the number line is associated with a unique real number. Con- versely, every real number is associated with a unique position on the number line. In lieu of this correspondence, the number line is usually called the real line. 136 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES  || Ordering the Real Numbers The real numbers are ordered on the real line in a manner identical to how we ordered the integers on the number line in Section 1 of Chapter 1. Order on the Real Line. Suppose that a and b are real numbers positioned on the real line as shown below. a b • Because a lies to the “left of” b, we say that a is “less than” b, or in mathematical symbols, a < b. The inequality symbol < is read “less than.” • Alternately, b lies to the “right of” a, so we can also say that b is “greater than” a, or in mathematical symbols, b > a. The inequality symbol > is read “greater than.” Here are two more inequality symbols that we will use in this section. Less than or equal to. If we want to say that a lies to the “left of” b, or shares the same position as b, then we say that a is “less than or equal to” b and write a ≤ b. The inequality symbol ≤ is pronounced “less than or equal to.” Greater than or equal to. If we want to say that b lise to the “right of” a, or shares the same position as a, then we say that b is “greater than ore equal to a and write b ≥ a. The inequality symbol ≥ is pronounced “greater than or equal to.”  || Set-Builder Notation Mathematicians use a construct called set-builder notation to describe sets or collections of numbers. The general form of set-builder notation looks as follows: {x : some statement about x} For example, suppose that we want to describe the set of “all real numbers that are less than 2.” We could use the following notation: A = {x : x < 2} 2.6. INEQUALITIES 137 This is read aloud as follows: “A equals the set of all x such that x is less than 2.” Some prefer to use a vertical bar instead of a colon. A = {x|x < 2} In this text we use the colon in set-builder notation, but feel free to use the vertical bar instead. They mean the same thing. One might still object that the notation {x : x < 2} is a bit vague. One objection could be “What type of numbers x are you referring to? Do you want the integers that are less than two or do you want the real numbers that are less than two?” As you can see, this is a valid objection. One way of addressing this objection is to write: A = {x ∈ R : x < 2} or A = {x ∈ N : x < 2} The first is read “A is the set of all x in R that are less than two,” while the second is read “A is the set of all x in N that are less than two.” Set-builder Assumption. In this text, unless there is a specific refernce to the set of numbers desired, we will assume that the notation {x : x < 2} is asking for the set of all real numbers less than 2. In Figure 2.15, we’ve shaded the set of real numbers {x : x < 2}. Because −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Figure 2.15: Shading the numbers less than 2. “less than” is the same as saying “left of,” we’ve shaded (in red) all points on the real line that lie to the left of the number two. Note that there is an “empty circle” at the number two. The point representing the number two is not shaded because we were only asked to shade the numbers that are strictly less than two. While the shading in Figure 2.15 is perfectly valid, much of the information provided in Figure 2.15 is unnecessary (and perhaps distracting). We only need to label the endpoint and shade the real numbers to the left of two, as we’ve done in constructing Figure 2.16. 2 Figure 2.16: You only need to label the endpoint. For contrast, suppose instead that we’re asked to shade the set of real numbers {x : x ≤ 2}. This means that we must shade all the real numbers 138 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES 2 Figure 2.17: You only need to label the endpoint. that are “less than or equal to 2” or “left of and including 2.” The resulting set is shaded in Figure 2.17. Note the difference between Figures 2.16 and 2.17. In Figures 2.16 we’re shading the set {x : x < 2}, so the number 2 is left unshaded (an empty dot). In Figures 2.17, we’re shading the set {x : x ≤ 2}, so the number 2 is shaded (a filled-in dot). You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Shade the set {x : x ≥ −3} on the real line.Shade {x : x ≤ 4} on the real line. Solution: The notation {x : x ≥ −3} is pronounced “the set of all real numbers x such that x is greater than or equal to −3.” Thus, we need to shade the number −3 and all real numbers to the right of −3. −34 Answer: ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Use set-builder notation to describe the set of real numbersUse set-builder notation to describe the following set of real numbers: −10 that are shaded on the number line below. −1 Solution: The number −1 is not shaded. Only the numbers to the left of −1 are shaded. This is the set of all real numbers x such that x is “less than” −1. Thus, we describe this set with the following set-builder notation: {x : x < −1} . Answer: {x : x > −10} !  || Interval Notation In Examples 1 and 2, we used set-builder notation to describe the set of real numbers greater than or equal to −3 and a second set of real numbers less than −1. There is another mathematical symbolism, called interval notation, that can be used to describe these sets of real numbers. Consider the first set of numbers from Example 1, {x : x ≥ −3}. 2.6. INEQUALITIES 139 −3 Sweeping our eyes “from left to right”, we use [−3,∞) to describe this set of real numbers. Some comments are in order: 1. The bracket at the left end means that −3 is included in the set. 2. As you move toward the right end of the real line, the numbers grow without bound. Hence, the ∞ symbol (positive infinity) is used to indi- cate that we are including all real numbers to the right of −3. However, ∞ is not really a number, so we use a parentheses to indicate we are “not including” this fictional point. The set of numbers from Example 2 is {x : x < −1}. −1 Sweeping our eyes “from left to right”, this set of real numbers is described with (−∞,−1). Again, comments are in order: 1. The number −1 is not included in this set. To indicate that it is not included, we use a parenthesis. 2. As you move toward the left end of the real line, the numbers decrease without bound. Hence, the −∞ symbol (negative infinity) is used to indicate that we are including all real numbers to the left of −1. Again, −∞ is not an actual number, so we use a parenthesis to indicate that we are not including this “fictional” point. Sweep your eyes from “left to right”. If you would like to insure that you correctly use interval notation, place the numbers in your interval notation in the same order as they are encountered as you sweep your eyes from “left to right” on the real line. A nice summary of set-builder and interval notation is presented in Table 2.1 at the end of the section.  || Equivalent Inequalities Like equations, two inequalities are equivalent if they have the same solution sets. 140 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Adding or Subtracting the Same Quantity from Both Sides of an Inequality. Let a and b be real numbers with a < b, If c is any real number, then a+ c < b+ c and a− c < b− c. That is, adding or subtracting the same amount from both sides of an inequality produces an equivalent inequality (does not change the solution). You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Solve for x: x− 2 ≤ 7. Sketch the solution on the real line,Use interval notation to describe the solution of: x− 7 < −8 then use set-builder and interval notation to describe your solution. Solution: To “undo” subtracting 2, we add 2 to both sides of the inequality. x− 2 ≤ 7 Original inequality. x− 2 + 2 ≤ 7 + 2 Add 2 to both sides. x ≤ 9 Simplify both sides. To shade the real numbers less than or equal to 9, we shade the number 9 and all real numbers to the left of 9. 9 Using set-builder notation, the solution is {x : x ≤ 9}. Using interval notation, the solution is (−∞, 9].Answer: (−∞,−1) ! If we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a positive number, we have an equivalent inequality.

Solve for x: 3x ≤ −9 Sketch the solution on the real line, Use interval notation to describe the solution of: 2x > −8 then use set-builder and interval notation to describe your solution. Solution: To “undo” multiplying by 3, divide both sides of the inequality by 3. Because we are dividing both sides by a positive number, we do not reverse the inequality sign. 3x ≤ −9 Original inequality. 3x 3 ≤ −9 3 Divide both sides by 3. x ≤ −3 Simplify both sides. Shade the real numbers less than or equal to −3. −3 Using set-builder notation, the solution is {x : x ≤ −3}. Using interval nota- tion, the solution is (−∞,−3]. Answer: (−4,∞) !  || Reversing the Inequality Sign Up to this point, it seems that the technique for solving inequalities is pretty much identical to the technique used to solve equations. However, in this section we are going to encounter one exception. Suppose we start with the valid inequality −2 < 5, then we multiply both sides by 2, 3, and 4. −2 < 5 −2 < 5 −2 < 5 2(−2) < 2(5) 3(−2) < 3(5) 4(−2) < 4(5) −4 < 10 −6 < 15 −8 < 20 Note that in each case, the resulting inequality is still valid. Caution! We’re about to make an error! Start again with −2 < 5, but this time multiply both sides by −2, −3, and −4. −2 < 5 −2 < 5 −2 < 5 −2(−2) < −2(5) −3(−2) < −3(5) −4(−2) < −4(5) 4 < −10 6 < −15 8 < −20 142 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Note that in each of the resulting inequalities, the inequality symbol is pointing the wrong way! When you multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you mustSome readers might prefer a more formal reason as to why we reverse the inequality when we multiply both sides by a negative number. Suppose that a < b. Then, subtracting b from both sides gives the result a− b < 0. This means that a− b is a negative number. Now, if c is a negative number, then the product (a− b)c is positive. Then: (a− b)c > 0 ac− bc > 0 ac− bc+ bc > 0 + bc ac > bc Thus, if you start with a < b and c < 0, then ac > bc. reverse the inequality sign. Starting with −2 < 5, multiply both sides by −2, −3, and −4, but reverse the inequality symbol. −2 < 5 −2 < 5 −2 < 5 −2(−2) > −2(5) −3(−2) > −3(5) −4(−2) > −4(5) 4 > −10 6 > −15 8 > −20 Note that each of the resulting inequalities is now a valid inquality. Multiplying or Dividing by a Negative Number. Let a and b be real numbers with a < b. If c is a real negative number, then ac > bc and a c > b c . That is, when multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you must reverse the inequality sign. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Solve for x: −2x < 4. Sketch the solution on the real line,Use interval notation to describe the solution of: −3x ≥ −6 then use set-builder and interval notation to describe your solution. Solution: To “undo” multiplying by −2, divide both sides by −2. Because we are dividing both sides by a negative number, we reverse the inequality sign. −2x < 4 Original inequality. −2x −2 > 4 −2 Divide both sides by −2.Reverse the inequality sign. x > −2 Simplify both sides. Shade the real numbers greater than −2. −2 Using set-builder notation, the solution is {x : x > −2}. Using interval nota- tion, the solution is (−2,∞).Answer: (−∞, 2] ! 2.6. INEQUALITIES 143  || Multiple Steps Sometimes you need to perform a sequence of steps to arrive at the solution. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Solve for x: 2x + 5 > −7. Sketch the solution on the real Use interval notation to describe the solution of: 3x− 2 ≤ 4 line, then use set-builder and interval notation to describe your solution. Solution: To “undo” adding 5, subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality. 2x+ 5 > −7 Original inequality. 2x+ 5− 5 > −7− 5 Subtract 5 from both sides. 2x > −12 Simplify both sides. To “undo” multiplying by 2, divide both sides by 2. Because we are dividing both sides by a positive number, we do not reverse the inequality sign. 2x 2 > −12 2 Divide both sides by 2. x > −6 Simplify both sides. Shade the real numbers greater than −6. −6 Using set-builder notation, the solution is {x : x > −6}. Using interval nota- tion, the solution is (−6,∞). Answer: (−∞, 2] ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Solve for x: 3 − 5x ≤ 2x + 17. Sketch the solution on the Use interval notation to describe the solution of: 4− x > 2x+ 1 real line, then use set-builder and interval notation to describe your solution. Solution: We need to isolate terms containing x on one side of the inequality. Start by subtracting 2x from both sides of the inequality. 3− 5x ≤ 2x+ 17 Original inequality. 3− 5x− 2x ≤ 2x+ 17− 2x Subtract 2x from both sides. 3− 7x ≤ 17 Simplify both sides. We continue to isolate terms containing x on one side of the inequality. Subtract 3 from both sides. 3− 7x− 3 ≤ 17− 3 Subtract 3 from both sides. −7x ≤ 14 Simplify both sides. 144 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES To “undo” multiplying by −7, divide both sides by −7. Because we are dividing both sides by a negative number, we reverse the inequality sign. −7x −7 ≥ 14 −7 Divide both sides by −7. x ≥ −2 Simplify both sides. Shade the real numbers greater than or equal to −2. −2 Using set-builder notation, the solution is {x : x ≥ −2}. Using interval nota- tion, the solution is [−2,∞).Answer: (−∞, 1) ! We clear fractions from an inequality in the usual manner, by multiplying both sides by the least common denominator. You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Solve for x: 3 4 − x 12 > 1 3 .Use interval notation to describe the solution of: 2x 3 − 3 4 ≥ −3 2 Solution: First, clear the fractions from the inequality by multiplying both sides by the least common denominator, which in this case is 12. 3 4 − x 12 > 1 3 Original inequality. 12 [ 3 4 − x 12 ] > [ 1 3 ] 12 Multiply both sides by 12. 12 [ 3 4 ] − 12 [ x 12 ] > [ 1 3 ] 12 Distribute the 12. 9− x > 4 Cancel and multiply. To “undo” adding 9, subtract 9 from both sides. 9− x− 9 > 4− 9 Subtract 9 from both sides. −x > −5 Simplify both sides. We could divide both sides by −1, but multiplying both sides by −1 will also do the job. Because we are multiplying both sides by a negative number, we reverse the inequality sign. (−1)(−x) < (−5)(−1) Multiply both sides by −1. Reverse the inequality sign. x < 5 Simplify both sides. 2.6.

Use interval notation to describe the solution of: 2.3x− 5.62 ≥ −1.4 Solution: First, clear the decimals from the inequality by multiplying both sides by 100, which moves each decimal point two places to the right. 3.25− 1.2x > 4.6 Original inequality. 325− 120x > 460 Multiply both sides by 100. 325− 120x− 325 > 460− 325 Subtract 325 from both sides. −120x > 135 Simplify both sides. −120x −120 < 135 −120 Divide both sides by −120.
