 || Using Grouping to Factor a Polynomial Sometimes a polynomial will not have a particular factor common to every term. However, we may still be able to produce a factored form for the polynomial. The polynomial x 3 + 3 x 2 − 6 x − 18 has no single factor that is common to every term. However, we notice that if we group together the first two terms and the second two terms, we see that each resulting binomial has a particular factor common to both terms. Factor x 2 out of the first two terms, and factor − 6 out of the second two terms. x 2 (x + 3)  − 6(x + 3) Now look closely at this binomial. Each of the two terms contains the factor (x + 3) . Factor out (x + 3) . (x + 3) (x 2 − 6) is the final factorization. x 3 + 3x 2 − 6x − 18 =  (x + 3) (x 2 − 6)  || Knowing when to Try the Grouping Method We are alerted to the idea of grouping when the polynomial we are considering has either of these qualities: no factor common to all terms an even number of terms When factoring by grouping, the sign ( +  or  − ) of the factor we are taking out will usually (but not always) be the same as the sign of the first term in that group.  ||
