Clearing Fractions If fractions occur in a formula, clear the fractions from the formula by multi- plying both sides of the formula by the common denominator. 114 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. The formula K = 1 2 mv2 is used to calculate the kinetic energySolve for g: s = 1 2 gt2 K of a particle of mass m moving with velocity v. Solve the equation for m. Solution: We’re asked to solve the equation K = (1/2)mv2 for m. First, clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by the common denominator. K = 1 2 mv2 Original equation. 2(K) = 2 ( 1 2 mv2 ) Multiply both sides by 2. 2K = mv2 Simplify. Cancel 2’s. Note that all terms containing m, the variable we are solving for, are already isolated on one side of the equation. We need only divide both sides by v2 to complete the solution. 2K v2 = mv2 v2 Divide both sides by v2. 2K v2 = m Simplify. Cancel v2 for v2. Note that the final answer has the form m = “Stuff”, where “Stuff” contains no occurrence of the variable m.Answer: g = 2s t2 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. As mentioned earlier, Newton’s Universal Law of GravitationSolve for q2: F = kq1q2 r2 is described by the formula F = GMm r2 . Solve this equation for m. Solution: We’re asked to solve the equation F = GMm/r2 for m. First, clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by the common denominator. F = GMm r2 Original equation. r2(F ) = r2 ( GMm r2 ) Multiply both sides by r2. r2F = GMm Simplify. Cancel r2 for r2. 2.4. FORMULAE 115 Note that all terms containing m, the variable we are solving for, are already isolated on one side of the equation. We need only divide both sides by GM to complete the solution. r2F GM = GMm GM Divide both sides by GM . r2F GM = m Simplify. Cancel GM for GM . Note that the final answer has the form m = “Stuff”, where “Stuff” contains no occurrence of the variable m. Answer: q2 = Fr2 kq1 !
