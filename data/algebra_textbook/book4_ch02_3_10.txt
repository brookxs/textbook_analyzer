Calculators Divisions can also be performed using a calculator. Sample Set C Example 2.20.  Divide 24 by 3. Table 2.4. Display Reads Type 24 24 Press ÷ 24 Type 3 3 Press = 8 The display now reads 8, and we conclude that . Example 2.21.  Divide 0 by 7. Table 2.5. Display Reads Type 0 0 Press ÷ 0 Type 7 7 Press = 0 The display now reads 0, and we conclude that . Example 2.22.  Divide 7 by 0. Since division by zero is undefined, the calculator should register some kind of error message. Table 2.6. Display Reads Type 7 7 Press ÷ 7 Type 0 0 Press = Error The error message indicates an undefined operation was attempted, in this case, division by zero. Practice Set C Use a calculator to perform each division. Exercise 2.3.13. (Go to Solution) Exercise 2.3.14. (Go to Solution) Exercise 2.3.15. (Go to Solution) Exercise 2.3.16.
