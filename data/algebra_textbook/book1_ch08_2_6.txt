The Equality Property of Fractions From our experience with arithmetic we may recall the equality property of fractions. Let a , b , c , d be real numbers such that b ≠ 0 and d ≠ 0. Equality Property of Fractions If , then a d = b c . If a d = b c , then . Two fractions are equal when their cross-products are equal. We see this property in the following examples: Example 8.19.  , since 2 · 12 = 3 · 8. Example 8.20.  , since 5y · 6y = 2 · 15y 2 and 30y 2 = 30y 2 . Example 8.21.  Since 9a · 4 = 18a · 2, .
