A Method of Dividing a Decimal By a Nonzero Decimal Now that we can divide decimals by nonzero whole numbers, we are in a position to divide decimals by a nonzero decimal. We will do so by converting a division by a decimal into a division by a whole number, a process with which we are already familiar. We'll illustrate the method using this example: Divide 4.32 by 1.8. Let's look at this problem as . The divisor is . We can convert into a whole number if we multiply it by 10. But, we know from our experience with fractions, that if we multiply the denomina­tor of a fraction by a nonzero whole number, we must multiply the numerator by that same nonzero whole number. Thus, when converting to a whole number by multiplying it by 10, we must also multiply the numerator by 10. We have converted the division 4.32÷1.8 into the division 43.2÷18, that is, Notice what has occurred. If we "move" the decimal point of the divisor one digit to the right, we must also "move" the decimal point of the dividend one place to the right. The word "move" actually indicates the process of multiplication by a power of 10. Method of Dividing a Decimal by a Decimal Number To divide a decimal by a nonzero decimal, Convert the divisor to a whole number by moving the decimal point to the position immediately to the right of the divisor's last digit. Move the decimal point of the dividend to the right the same number of digits it was moved in the divisor. Set the decimal point in the quotient by placing a decimal point directly above the newly located decimal point in the dividend. Divide as usual. Sample Set B Find the following quotients. Example 6.46.  32.66÷7.1 The divisor has one decimal place. Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 1 place to the right. Set the decimal point. Divide as usual. Thus, 32.66÷7.1 = 4.6. Check: 32.66÷7.1 = 4.6 if 4.6 × 7.1 = 32.66 Example 6.47.  1.0773÷0.513 The divisor has 3 decimal places. Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 3 places to the right. Set the decimal place and divide. Thus, 1.0773÷0.513 = 2.1. Checking by multiplying 2.1 and 0.513 will convince us that we have obtained the correct result. (Try it.) Example 6.48.  12÷0.00032 The divisor has 5 decimal places. Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 5 places to the right. We will need to add 5 zeros to 12. Set the decimal place and divide. This is now the same as the division of whole numbers. Checking assures us that 12÷0.00032 = 37,500. Practice Set B Find the decimal representation of each quotient. Exercise 6.7.5.
