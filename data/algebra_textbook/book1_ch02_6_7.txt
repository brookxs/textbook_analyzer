The Quotient Rule for Exponents The second rule we wish to develop is the rule for dividing two exponential quantities having the same base and natural number exponents. The following examples suggest a rule for dividing two exponential quantities having the same base and natural number exponents. Example 2.83.  Example 2.84.  QUOTIENT RULE FOR EXPONENTS If x is a real number and n and m are natural numbers,.To divide two exponential quantities having the same nonzero base, subtract the exponent of the denominator from the exponent of the numerator. Keep in mind that the exponential quantities being divided must have the same base for this rule to apply.
