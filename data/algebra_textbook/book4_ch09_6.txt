 || The Meaning and Notation for Area The product (length unit)⋅(length unit) = (length unit)2 , or, square length unit (sq length unit), can be interpreted physically as the area of a surface. Area The area of a surface is the amount of square length units contained in the surface. For example, 3 sq in. means that 3 squares, 1 inch on each side, can be placed precisely on some surface. (The squares may have to be cut and rearranged so they match the shape of the surface.) We will examine the area of the following geometric figures.  || Area Formulas We can determine the areas of these geometric figures using the following formulas. Table 9.5.   Figure Area Formula Statement Triangle Area of a triangle is one half the base times the height. Rectangle A R = l ⋅ w Area of a rectangle is the length times the width. Parallelogram A P = b ⋅ h Area of a parallelogram is base times the height. Trapezoid Area of a trapezoid is one half the sum of the two bases times the height. Circle A C = πr 2 Area of a circle is π times the square of the radius.  || Finding Areas of Some Common Geometric Figures Sample Set A Example 9.27.  Find the area of the triangle. The area of this triangle is 60 sq ft, which is often written as 60 ft2. Example 9.28.  Find the area of the rectangle. Let's first convert 4 ft 2 in. to inches. Since we wish to convert to inches, we'll use the unit fraction since it has inches in the numerator. Then, Thus, 4 ft 2 in. = 48 in. + 2 in. = 50 in. The area of this rectangle is 400 sq in. Example 9.29.  Find the area of the parallelogram. The area of this parallelogram is 63.86 sq cm. Example 9.30.  Find the area of the trapezoid. The area of this trapezoid is 71.545 sq mm. Example 9.31.  Find the approximate area of the circle. The area of this circle is approximately 886.23 sq ft. Practice Set A Find the area of each of the following geometric figures. Exercise 9.6.1.

(Go to Solution)  || The Meaning and Notation for Volume The product (length unit)(length unit)(length unit) = (length unit)3 , or cubic length unit (cu length unit), can be interpreted physically as the volume of a three-dimensional object. Volume The volume of an object is the amount of cubic length units contained in the object. For example, 4 cu mm means that 4 cubes, 1 mm on each side, would precisely fill some three-dimensional object. (The cubes may have to be cut and rearranged so they match the shape of the object.)  || Volume Formulas Table 9.6.   Figure Volume Formula Statement Rectangular solid The volume of a rectangular solid is the length times the width times the height. Sphere The volume of a sphere is times π times the cube of the radius. Cylinder The volume of a cylinder is π times the square of the radius times the height. Cone The volume of a cone is times π times the square of the radius times the height.  || Finding Volumes of Some Common Geometric Objects Sample Set B Example 9.32.  Find the volume of the rectangular solid. The volume of this rectangular solid is 270 cu in. Example 9.33.  Find the approximate volume of the sphere. The approximate volume of this sphere is 904.32 cu cm, which is often written as 904.32 cm3. Example 9.34.  Find the approximate volume of the cylinder. The volume of this cylinder is approximately 588.05292 cu ft. The volume is approximate because we approximated π with 3.14. Example 9.35.  Find the approximate volume of the cone. Round to two decimal places. The volume of this cone is approximately 20.93 cu mm. The volume is approximate because we approximated π with 3.14. Practice Set B Find the volume of each geometric object. If π is required, approximate it with 3.14 and find the approximate volume. Exercise 9.6.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 9.6.8.
