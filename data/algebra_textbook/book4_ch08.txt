 ||  || Estimation by Rounding The rounding technique estimates the result of a computation by rounding the numbers involved in the computation to one or two nonzero digits. Sample Set A Example 8.1.  Estimate the sum: 2,357 + 6,106. Notice that 2,357 is near and that 6,106 is near The sum can be estimated by 2,400 + 6,100 = 8,500. (It is quick and easy to add 24 and 61.) Thus, 2,357 + 6,106 is about 8,400. In fact, 2,357 + 6,106 = 8,463. Practice Set A Exercise 8.2.1. (Go to Solution) Estimate the sum: 4,216 + 3,942. Exercise 8.2.2. (Go to Solution) Estimate the sum: 812 + 514. Exercise 8.2.3. (Go to Solution) Estimate the sum: 43,892 + 92,106. Sample Set B Example 8.2.  Estimate the difference: 5,203 – 3,015. Notice that 5,203 is near and that 3,015 is near The difference can be estimated by 5,200 – 3,000 = 2,200. Thus, 5,203 – 3,015 is about 2,200. In fact, 5,203 – 3,015 = 2,188. We could make a less accurate estimation by observing that 5,203 is near 5,000. The number 5,000 has only one nonzero digit rather than two (as does 5,200). This fact makes the estimation quicker (but a little less accurate). We then estimate the difference by 5,000 – 3,000 = 2,000, and conclude that 5,203 – 3,015 is about 2,000. This is why we say "answers may vary." Practice Set B Exercise 8.2.4. (Go to Solution) Estimate the difference: 628 – 413. Exercise 8.2.5. (Go to Solution) Estimate the difference: 7,842 – 5,209. Exercise 8.2.6. (Go to Solution) Estimate the difference: 73,812 – 28,492. Sample Set C Example 8.3.  Estimate the product: 73 ⋅ 46. Notice that 73 is near and that 46 is near The product can be estimated by 70 ⋅ 50 = 3,500. (Recall that to multiply numbers ending in zeros, we multiply the nonzero digits and affix to this product the total number of ending zeros in the factors. See Section 2.2 for a review of this technique.) Thus, 73 ⋅ 46 is about 3,500. In fact, 73 ⋅ 46 = 3,358. Example 8.4.  Estimate the product: 87 ⋅ 4,316. Notice that 87 is close to and that 4,316 is close to The product can be estimated by 90 ⋅ 4,000 = 360,000. Thus, 87 ⋅ 4,316 is about 360,000. In fact, 87 ⋅ 4,316 = 375,492. Practice Set C Exercise 8.2.7. (Go to Solution) Estimate the product: 31 ⋅ 87. Exercise 8.2.8. (Go to Solution) Estimate the product: 18 ⋅ 42. Exercise 8.2.9. (Go to Solution) Estimate the product: 16 ⋅ 94. Sample Set D Example 8.5.  Estimate the quotient: 153 ÷ 17. Notice that 153 is close to and that 17 is close to The quotient can be estimated by 150 ÷ 15 = 10. Thus, 153 ÷ 17 is about 10. In fact, 153 ÷ 17 = 9. Example 8.6.  Estimate the quotient: 742,000 ÷ 2,400. Notice that 742,000 is close to , and that 2,400 is close to The quotient can be estimated by 700,000 ÷ 2,000 = 350. Thus, 742,000 ÷ 2,400 is about 350. In fact, . Practice Set D Exercise 8.2.10. (Go to Solution) Estimate the quotient: 221 ÷ 18. Exercise 8.2.11. (Go to Solution) Estimate the quotient: 4,079 ÷ 381. Exercise 8.2.12. (Go to Solution) Estimate the quotient: 609,000 ÷ 16,000. Sample Set E Example 8.7.  Estimate the sum: 53.82 + 41.6. Notice that 53.82 is close to and that 41.6 is close to The sum can be estimated by 54 + 42 = 96. Thus, 53.82 + 41.6 is about 96. In fact, 53.82 + 41.6 = 95.42. Practice Set E Exercise 8.2.13. (Go to Solution) Estimate the sum: 61.02 + 26.8. Exercise 8.2.14. (Go to Solution) Estimate the sum: 109.12 + 137.88. Sample Set F Example 8.8.  Estimate the product: (31.28)(14.2). Notice that 31.28 is close to and that 14.2 is close to The product can be estimated by 30 ⋅ 15 = 450. ( 3 ⋅ 15 = 45, then affix one zero.) Thus, (31.28)(14.2) is about 450. In fact, (31.28)(14.2) = 444.176. Example 8.9.  Estimate 21% of 5.42. Notice that 21% = .21 as a decimal, and that .21 is close to Notice also that 5.42 is close to Then, 21% of 5.42 can be estimated by (.2)(5) = 1. Thus, 21% of 5.42 is about 1. In fact, 21% of 5.42 is 1.1382. Practice Set F Exercise 8.2.15. (Go to Solution) Estimate the product: (47.8)(21.1). Exercise 8.2.16. (Go to Solution) Estimate 32% of 14.88.  ||  ||  || The Distributive Property Distributive Property The distributive property is a characteristic of numbers that involves both addition and multiplication. It is used often in algebra, and we can use it now to obtain exact results for a multiplication. Suppose we wish to compute 3(2 + 5). We can proceed in either of two ways, one way which is known to us already (the order of operations), and a new way (the distributive property). Compute 3(2 + 5) using the order of operations. 3 ( 2 + 5 ) Operate inside the parentheses first: 2 + 5 = 7. 3 ( 2 + 5 ) = 3 ⋅ 7 Now multiply 3 and 7. 3 ( 2 + 5 ) = 3 ⋅ 7 = 21 Thus, 3(2 + 5) = 21. Compute 3(2 + 5) using the distributive property. We know that multiplication describes repeated addition. Thus, Thus, 3(2 + 5) = 21. Let's look again at this use of the distributive property. The 3 has been distributed to the 2 and 5. This is the distributive property. We distribute the factor to each addend in the parentheses. The distributive property works for both sums and differences. Sample Set A Example 8.15.  Using the order of operations, we get Example 8.16.  Using the order of operations, we get Example 8.17.  Example 8.18.  Practice Set A Use the distributive property to compute each value.

(Go to Solution) 15(30 – 8)  || Estimation Using the Distributive Property We can use the distributive property to obtain exact results for products such as 25 ⋅ 23. The distributive property works best for products when one of the factors ends in 0 or 5. We shall restrict our attention to only such products. Sample Set B Use the distributive property to compute each value. Example 8.19.  25 ⋅ 23 Notice that 23 = 20 + 3. We now write Thus, 25 ⋅ 23 = 575 We could have proceeded by writing 23 as 30 – 7. Example 8.20.  15 ⋅ 37 Notice that 37 = 30 + 7. We now write Thus, 15 ⋅ 37 = 555 We could have proceeded by writing 37 as 40 – 3. Example 8.21.  15 ⋅ 86 Notice that 86 = 80 + 6. We now write We could have proceeded by writing 86 as 90 – 4. Practice Set B Use the distributive property to compute each value. Exercise 8.4.8. (Go to Solution) 25 ⋅ 12 Exercise 8.4.9.
