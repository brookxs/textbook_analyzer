Rate-Time Problems ·        Rate = Quantity/Time or ·        Quantity = Rate × Time Example:  A fast employee can assemble 7 radios in an hour, and another slower employee can only assemble 5 radios per hour. If both employees work together, how long will it take to assemble 26 radios? The two together will build 7 + 5 = 12 radios in an hour, so their combined rate is 12 radios/hr. Using Time = Quantity/Rate, Time = 26/12 = 2 1/6 h or 2 hours 10 minutes Example:  you are driving along at 55 mph when you are passed by a car doing 85 mph. How long will it take for the car that passed you to be one mile ahead of you? We know the two rates, and we know that the difference between the two distances traveled will be one mile, but we don’t know the actual distances. Let D be the distance that you travel in time t, and D + 1 be the distance that the other car traveled in time t. Using the rate equation in the form distance = speed • time for each car we can write D = 55 t, and D + 1 = 85 t Substituting the first equation into the second, 55t + 1 = 85t -30t = -1 t = 1/30 hr(or 2 minutes) Rate-Time Problems ·        Rate = Quantity/Time or ·        Quantity = Rate × Time Example:  A fast employee can assemble 7 radios in an hour, and another slower employee can only assemble 5 radios per hour.
