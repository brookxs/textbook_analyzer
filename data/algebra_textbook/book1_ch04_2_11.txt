Coefficients Coefficient In algebra, as we now know, a letter is often used to represent some quantity. Suppose we represent some quantity by the letter x . The notation 5x means x + x + x + x + x . We can now see that we have five of these quantities. In the expression 5x , the number 5 is called the numerical coefficient of the quantity x . Often, the numerical coefficient is just called the coefficient. The coefficient of a quantity records how many of that quantity there are.
