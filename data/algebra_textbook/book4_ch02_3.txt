 || Division Division is a description of repeated subtraction. In the process of division, the concern is how many times one number is contained in another number. For example, we might be interested in how many 5's are contained in 15. The word times is significant because it implies a relationship between division and multiplication. There are several notations used to indicate division. Suppose Q records the number of times 5 is contained in 15. We can indicate this by writing Each of these division notations describes the same number, represented here by the symbol . Each notation also converts to the same multiplication form. It is In division, Dividend the number being divided into is called the dividend. Divisor the number dividing into the dividend is the divisor. Quotient the result of the division is called the quotient. Sample Set A Find the following quotients using multiplication facts. Example 2.12.  Since , Notice also that Thus, 6 is contained in 18 three times. Example 2.13.  Since , Notice also that 3 could be subtracted exactly 8 times from 24. This implies that 3 is contained in 24 eight times. Example 2.14.  Since , Thus, there are 6 sixes in 36. Example 2.15.  Since , Thus, there are 8 nines in 72. Practice Set A Use multiplication facts to determine the following quotients. Exercise 2.3.1. (Go to Solution) Exercise 2.3.2. (Go to Solution) Exercise 2.3.3. (Go to Solution) Exercise 2.3.4.

The question is What number, if any, is ? Let's represent this unknown quotient by . Then, Converting this division problem to its corresponding multiplication problem, we get From our knowledge of multiplication, we can understand that if the product of two whole numbers is zero, then one or both of the whole numbers must be zero. Since any nonzero whole number is certainly not zero, must represent zero. Then, Zero Divided By Any Nonzero Whole Number Is Zero Zero divided any nonzero whole number is zero.  || Division by Zero (Zero as a Divisor: , a ≠ 0) Now we ask, What number, if any, is ? Letting represent a possible quotient, we get Converting to the corresponding multiplication form, we have Since , . But this is absurd. This would mean that , or . A nonzero whole number cannot equal 0! Thus, does not name a number Division by Zero is Undefined Division by zero does not name a number. It is, therefore, undefined.  || Division by and Into Zero (Zero as a Dividend and Divisor:) We are now curious about zero divided by zero . If we let represent a potential quotient, we get Converting to the multiplication form, This results in This is a statement that is true regardless of the number used in place of . For example, , since . , since . , since . A unique quotient cannot be determined. Indeterminant Since the result of the division is inconclusive, we say that is indeterminant. is Indeterminant The division is indeterminant. Sample Set B Perform, if possible, each division. Example 2.16.  . Since division by 0 does not name a whole number, no quotient exists, and we state is undefined Example 2.17.  . Since division by 0 does not name a defined number, no quotient exists, and we state is undefined Example 2.18.  . Since division into 0 by any nonzero whole number results in 0, we have Example 2.19.  . Since division into 0 by any nonzero whole number results in 0, we have Practice Set B Perform, if possible, the following divisions. Exercise 2.3.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 2.3.8.

Display Reads Type 24 24 Press ÷ 24 Type 3 3 Press = 8 The display now reads 8, and we conclude that . Example 2.21.  Divide 0 by 7. Table 2.5. Display Reads Type 0 0 Press ÷ 0 Type 7 7 Press = 0 The display now reads 0, and we conclude that . Example 2.22.  Divide 7 by 0. Since division by zero is undefined, the calculator should register some kind of error message. Table 2.6. Display Reads Type 7 7 Press ÷ 7 Type 0 0 Press = Error The error message indicates an undefined operation was attempted, in this case, division by zero.
