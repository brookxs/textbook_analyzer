Combining Like terms Combining like terms is permitted because of the distributive law. For example, 3x2 + 5x2 = (3 + 5)x2 = 8x2 What happened here is that the distributive law was used in reverse—we “undistributed” a common factor of x2 from each term. The way to think about this operation is that if you have three x-squareds, and then you get five more x-squareds, you will then have eight x-squareds. Example:  x2 + 2x + 3x2 + 2 + 4x + 7 Starting with the highest power of x, we see that there are four x-squareds in all (1x2 + 3x2). Then we collect the first powers of x, and see that there are six of them (2x + 4x). The only thing left is the constants 2 + 7 = 9. Putting this all together we get x2 + 2x + 3x2 + 2 + 4x + 7 = 4x2 + 6x + 9 Combining Like terms Combining like terms is permitted because of the distributive law.
