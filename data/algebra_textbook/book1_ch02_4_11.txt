The Distributive Properties When we were first introduced to multiplication we saw that it was developed as a description for repeated addition. 4 + 4 + 4 = 3⋅4 Notice that there are three 4’s, that is, 4 appears 3 times. Hence, 3 times 4.We know that algebra is generalized arithmetic. We can now make an important generalization. When a number a is added repeatedly n times, we have Then, using multiplication as a description for repeated addition, we can replace For example: Example 2.47.  x + x + x + x can be written as 4x since x is repeatedly added 4 times. x + x + x + x = 4x Example 2.48.  r + r can be written as 2r since r is repeatedly added 2 times. r + r = 2r The distributive property involves both multiplication and addition. Let’s rewrite 4(a + b). We proceed by reading 4(a + b) as a multiplication: 4 times the quantity (a + b) . This directs us to write Now we use the commutative property of addition to collect all the a ' s together and all the b ' s together. Now, using multiplication as a description for repeated addition, we have We have distributed the 4 over the sum to both a and b . The Distributive Property The distributive property is useful when we cannot or do not wish to perform operations inside parentheses.
