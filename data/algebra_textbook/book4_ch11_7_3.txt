Number Problems Sample Set A Example 11.44.  What number decreased by six is five? Let represent the unknown number. Translate the words to mathematical symbols and construct an equation. Read phrases. Solve this equation. Add 6 to both sides. Check the result. When 11 is decreased by 6, the result is , which is equal to 5. The solution checks. The number is 11. Example 11.45.  When three times a number is increased by four, the result is eight more than five times the number. Let the unknown number. Translate the phrases to mathematical symbols and construct an equation. Check this result. Three times is . Increasing by 4 results in . Now, five times is . Increasing by results in . The results agree, and the solution checks. The number is Example 11.46.  Consecutive integers have the property that if Consecutive odd or even integers have the property that if The sum of three consecutive odd integers is equal to one less than twice the first odd integer. Find the three integers. Translate the words to mathematical symbols and construct an equation. Read phrases. Check this result. The sum of the three integers is One less than twice the first integer is . Since these two results are equal, the solution checks. The three odd integers are -7, -5, -3.
