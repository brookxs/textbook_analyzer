The Method Of Extraction Of Roots Extraction of Roots Quadratic equations of the form x 2 − K = 0 can be solved by the method of extraction of roots by rewriting it in the form x 2 = K. To solve x 2 = K, we are required to find some number, x, that when squared produces K. This number, x, must be a square root of K. If K is greater than zero, we know that it possesses two square roots, and We also know thatWe now have two replacements for x that produce true statements when substituted into the equation. Thus, and are both solutions to x 2 = K. We use the notation to denote both the principal and the secondary square roots.
