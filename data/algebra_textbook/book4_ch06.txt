 ||  || Digits to the Right of the Ones Position We began our study of arithmetic (Section 1.2) by noting that our number system is called a positional number system with base ten. We also noted that each position has a particular value. We observed that each position has ten times the value of the position to its right. This means that each position has the value of the position to its left. Thus, a digit written to the right of the units position must have a value of of 1. Recalling that the word "of" translates to multiplication (⋅), we can see that the value of the first position to the right of the units digit is of 1, or The value of the second position to the right of the units digit is of , or The value of the third position to the right of the units digit is of , or This pattern continues. We can now see that if we were to write digits in positions to the right of the units positions, those positions have values that are fractions. Not only do the positions have fractional values, but the fractional values are all powers of 10 (10,102 ,103 ,…).  || Decimal Fractions Decimal Point, Decimal If we are to write numbers with digits appearing to the right of the units digit, we must have a way of denoting where the whole number part ends and the fractional part begins. Mathematicians denote the separation point of the units digit and the tenths digit by writing a decimal point. The word decimal comes from the Latin prefix "deci" which means ten, and we use it because we use a base ten number system. Numbers written in this form are called decimal fractions, or more simply, decimals. Notice that decimal numbers have the suffix "th." Decimal Fraction A decimal fraction is a fraction in which the denominator is a power of 10. The following numbers are examples of decimals. 42.6 The 6 is in the tenths position. 9.8014 The 8 is in the tenths position. The 0 is in the hundredths position. The 1 is in the thousandths position. The 4 is in the ten thousandths position. 0.93 The 9 is in the tenths position. The 3 is in the hundredths position. Note Quite often a zero is inserted in front of a decimal point (in the units position) of a decimal fraction that has a value less than one. This zero helps keep us from overlooking the decimal point. 0.7 The 7 is in the tenths position. Note We can insert zeros to the right of the right-most digit in a decimal fraction without changing the value of the number.  || Reading Decimal Fractions Reading a Decimal Fraction To read a decimal fraction, Read the whole number part as usual. (If the whole number is less than 1, omit steps 1 and 2.) Read the decimal point as the word "and." Read the number to the right of the decimal point as if it were a whole number. Say the name of the position of the last digit. Sample Set A Read the following numbers. Example 6.1.  6.8 Note Some people read this as "six point eight." This phrasing gets the message across, but technically, "six and eight tenths" is the correct phrasing. Example 6.2.  14.116 Example 6.3.  0.0019 Example 6.4.  81 Eighty-one In this problem, the indication is that any whole number is a decimal fraction. Whole numbers are often called decimal numbers. 81 = 81 . 0 Practice Set A Read the following decimal fractions. Exercise 6.2.1. (Go to Solution) 12.9 Exercise 6.2.2.

Write the decimal part of the number so that the right-most digit appears in the position indicated in the word name. If necessary, insert zeros to the right of the decimal point in order that the right-most digit appears in the correct position. Sample Set B Write each number. Example 6.5.  Thirty-one and twelve hundredths. The decimal position indicated is the hundredths position. 31.12 Example 6.6.  Two and three hundred-thousandths. The decimal position indicated is the hundred thousandths. We'll need to insert enough zeros to the immediate right of the decimal point in order to locate the 3 in the correct position. 2.00003 Example 6.7.  Six thousand twenty-seven and one hundred four millionths. The decimal position indicated is the millionths position. We'll need to insert enough zeros to the immediate right of the decimal point in order to locate the 4 in the correct position. 6,027.000104 Example 6.8.  Seventeen hundredths. The decimal position indicated is the hundredths position. 0.17 Practice Set B Write each decimal fraction. Exercise 6.2.5. (Go to Solution) Three hundred six and forty-nine hundredths. Exercise 6.2.6. (Go to Solution) Nine and four thousandths. Exercise 6.2.7. (Go to Solution) Sixty-one millionths.  ||  || Converting an Ordinary Decimal to a Fraction We can convert a decimal fraction to a fraction, essentially, by saying it in words, then writing what we say. We may have to reduce that fraction. Sample Set A Convert each decimal fraction to a proper fraction or a mixed number. Example 6.9.  Reading: six tenths→ . Reduce: . Example 6.10.  Reading: nine hundred three thousands→ . Example 6.11.  Reading: eighteen and sixty-one hundredths→ . Example 6.12.  Reading: five hundred eight and five ten thousandths→ . Reduce: .

(Go to Solution) Exercise 6.3.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 6.3.8. (Go to Solution)  ||  || Rounding Decimal Numbers We first considered the concept of rounding numbers in Section 1.4 where our concern with rounding was related to whole numbers only. With a few minor changes, we can apply the same rules of rounding to decimals. To round a decimal to a particular position: Mark the position of the round-off digit (with an arrow or check). Note whether the digit to the immediate right of the marked digit is less than 5. If so, leave the round-off digit unchanged. 5 or greater. If so, add 1 to the round-off digit. If the round-off digit is to the right of the decimal point, eliminate all the digits to its right. to the left of the decimal point, replace all the digits between it and the decimal point with zeros and eliminate the decimal point and all the decimal digits. Sample Set A Round each decimal to the specified position. (The numbers in parentheses indicate which step is being used.) Example 6.15.  Round 32.116 to the nearest hundredth. 1) 2b) The digit immediately to the right is 6, and 6 > 5, so we add 1 to the round-off digit: 1 + 1 = 2 3a) The round-off digit is to the right of the decimal point, so we eliminate all digits to its right. 32.12 The number 32.116 rounded to the nearest hundredth is 32.12. Example 6.16.  Round 633.14216 to the nearest hundred. 1) 2a) The digit immediately to the right is 3, and 3 < 5 so we leave the round-off digit unchanged. 3b) The round-off digit is to the left of 0, so we replace all the digits between it and the decimal point with zeros and eliminate the decimal point and all the decimal digits. 600 The number 633.14216 rounded to the nearest hundred is 600. Example 6.17.  1,729.63 rounded to the nearest ten is 1,730. Example 6.18.  1.0144 rounded to the nearest tenth is 1.0. Example 6.19.  60.98 rounded to the nearest one is 61. Sometimes we hear a phrase such as "round to three decimal places." This phrase means that the round-off digit is the third decimal digit (the digit in the thousandths position). Example 6.20.  67.129 rounded to the second decimal place is 67.13. Example 6.21.  67.129558 rounded to 3 decimal places is 67.130. Practice Set A Round each decimal to the specified position. Exercise 6.4.1. (Go to Solution) 4.816 to the nearest hundredth. Exercise 6.4.2. (Go to Solution) 0.35928 to the nearest ten thousandths. Exercise 6.4.3. (Go to Solution) 82.1 to the nearest one. Exercise 6.4.4. (Go to Solution) 753.98 to the nearest hundred. Exercise 6.4.5. (Go to Solution) Round 43.99446 to three decimal places. Exercise 6.4.6. (Go to Solution) Round 105.019997 to four decimal places. Exercise 6.4.7. (Go to Solution) Round 99.9999 to two decimal places.  ||  || The Logic Behind the Method Consider the sum of 4.37 and 3.22. Changing each decimal to a fraction, we have Performing the addition, we get Thus, 4.37 + 3.22 = 7.59.  || The Method of Adding and Subtracting Decimals When writing the previous addition, we could have written the numbers in col­umns. This agrees with our previous result. From this observation, we can suggest a method for adding and subtracting decimal numbers. Method of Adding and Subtracting Decimals To add or subtract decimals: Align the numbers vertically so that the decimal points line up under each other and the corresponding decimal positions are in the same column. Add or subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Place a decimal point in the resulting sum or difference directly under the other decimal points. Sample Set A Find the following sums and differences. Example 6.22.  9.813 + 2.140 Example 6.23.  841.0056 + 47.016 + 19.058 To insure that the columns align properly, we can write a 0 in the position at the end of the numbers 47.016 and 19.058 without changing their values. Example 6.24.  1.314 – 0.58 Example 6.25.  16.01 – 7.053 Example 6.26.  Find the sum of 6.88106 and 3.5219 and round it to three decimal places. We need to round the sum to the thousandths position. Since the digit in the position immediately to the right is 9, and 9>5, we get 10.403 Example 6.27.  Wendy has $643.12 in her checking account. She writes a check for $16.92. How much is her new account balance? To find the new account balance, we need to find the difference between 643.12 and 16.92. We will subtract 16.92 from 643.12. After writing a check for $16.92, Wendy now has a balance of $626.20 in her checking account. Practice Set A Find the following sums and differences. Exercise 6.5.1. (Go to Solution) 3.187 + 2.992 Exercise 6.5.2. (Go to Solution) 14.987 – 5.341 Exercise 6.5.3. (Go to Solution) 0.5261 + 1.0783 Exercise 6.5.4. (Go to Solution) 1.06 – 1.0535 Exercise 6.5.5. (Go to Solution) 16,521.07 + 9,256.15 Exercise 6.5.6. (Go to Solution) Find the sum of 11.6128 and 14.07353, and round it to two decimal places.  || Calculators The calculator can be useful for finding sums and differences of decimal numbers. However, calculators with an eight-digit display cannot be used when working with decimal numbers that contain more than eight digits, or when the sum results in more than eight digits. In practice, an eight-place decimal will seldom be encoun­tered. There are some inexpensive calculators that can handle 13 decimal places. Sample Set B Use a calculator to find each sum or difference. Example 6.28.  42.0638 + 126.551 Table 6.16.     Display Reads Type 42.0638 42.0638 Press + 42.0638 Type 126.551 126.551 Press = 168.6148 The sum is 168.6148. Example 6.29.  Find the difference between 305.0627 and 14.29667.

We can, however, find the sum by hand. The sum is 3,942.071786. Practice Set B Use a calculator to perform each operation. Exercise 6.5.7. (Go to Solution) 4.286 + 8.97 Exercise 6.5.8.

(Go to Solution) Find the sum of 2,776.00019 and 2,009.00012.  ||  || The Logic Behind the Method Consider the product of 3.2 and 1.46. Changing each decimal to a fraction, we have Thus, (3.2)(1.46) = 4.672. Notice that the factor Using this observation, we can suggest that the sum of the number of decimal places in the factors equals the number of decimal places in the product.  || The Method of Multiplying Decimals Method of Multiplying Decimals To multiply decimals, Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Find the sum of the number of decimal places in the factors. The number of decimal places in the product is the sum found in step 2. Sample Set A Find the following products. Example 6.31.  6.5 ⋅ 4.3 Thus, 6.5⋅4.3 = 27.95. Example 6.32.  23.4⋅1.96 Thus, 23.4⋅1.96 = 45.864. Example 6.33.  Find the product of 0.251 and 0.00113 and round to three decimal places. Now, rounding to three decimal places, we get Practice Set A Find the following products. Exercise 6.6.1. (Go to Solution) 5.3⋅ 8.6 Exercise 6.6.2. (Go to Solution) 2.12⋅ 4.9 Exercise 6.6.3.

(Go to Solution) 10,000 ⋅ 5.394  || Calculators Calculators can be used to find products of decimal numbers. However, a calculator that has only an eight-digit display may not be able to handle numbers or products that result in more than eight digits. But there are plenty of inexpensive ($50 - $75) calculators with more than eight-digit displays. Sample Set B Find the following products, if possible, using a calculator. Example 6.34.  2.58 ⋅ 8.61 Table 6.18.     Display Reads Type 2.58 2.58 Press × 2.58 Type 8.61 8.61 Press = 22.2138 The product is 22.2138. Example 6.35.  0.006 ⋅ 0.0042 Table 6.19.     Display Reads Type .006 .006 Press × .006 Type .0042 0.0042 Press = 0.0000252 We know that there will be seven decimal places in the product (since 3 + 4 = 7). Since the display shows 7 decimal places, we can assume the product is correct. Thus, the product is 0.0000252. Example 6.36.  0.0026 ⋅ 0.11976 Since we expect 4 + 5 = 9 decimal places in the product, we know that an eight-digit display calculator will not be able to provide us with the exact value. To obtain the exact value, we must use "hand technology." Suppose, however, that we agree to round off this product to three decimal places. We then need only four decimal places on the display. Table 6.20.     Display Reads Type .0026 .0026 Press × .0026 Type .11976 0.11976 Press = 0.0003114 Rounding 0.0003114 to three decimal places we get 0.000. Thus, 0.0026 ⋅ 0.11976 = 0.000 to three decimal places. Practice Set B Use a calculator to find each product. If the calculator will not provide the exact product, round the result to four decimal places. Exercise 6.6.10. (Go to Solution) 5.126 ⋅ 4.08 Exercise 6.6.11.

Multiplication Number of Zeros in the Power of 10 Number of Positions the Decimal Point Has Been Moved to the Right 10 ⋅ 8 . 315274 = 83 . 15274 1 1 100 ⋅ 8 . 315274 = 831 . 5274 2 2 1, 000 ⋅ 8 . 315274 = 8, 315 . 274 3 3 10 , 000 ⋅ 8 . 315274 = 83 , 152 . 74 4 4 Multiplying a Decimal by a Power of 10 To multiply a decimal by a power of 10, move the decimal place to the right of its current position as many places as there are zeros in the power of 10. Add zeros if necessary. Sample Set C Find the following products. Example 6.37.  100⋅34.876. Since there are 2 zeros in 100, Move the decimal point in 34.876 two places to the right. Example 6.38.  1,000⋅4.8058. Since there are 3 zeros in 1,000, move the decimal point in 4.8058 three places to the right. Example 6.39.  10,000⋅56.82. Since there are 4 zeros in 10,000, move the decimal point in 56.82 four places to the right. We will have to add two zeros in order to obtain the four places. Since there is no fractional part, we can drop the decimal point. Example 6.40.  Example 6.41.  Practice Set C Find the following products. Exercise 6.6.14.

(Go to Solution) Find 1.1 of the sum of 8.6 and 4.2.  ||  || The Logic Behind the Method As we have done with addition, subtraction, and multiplication of decimals, we will study a method of division of decimals by converting them to fractions, then we will make a general rule. We will proceed by using this example: Divide 196.8 by 6. We have, up to this point, divided 196.8 by 6 and have gotten a quotient of 32 with a remainder of 4. If we follow our intuition and bring down the .8, we have the division 4.8÷6. Thus, 4.8÷6 = .8. Now, our intuition and experience with division direct us to place the .8 immedi­ately to the right of 32. From these observations, we suggest the following method of division.  || A Method of Dividing a Decimal by a Nonzero Whole Number Method of Dividing a Decimal by a Nonzero Whole Number To divide a decimal by a nonzero whole number: Write a decimal point above the division line and directly over the decimal point of the dividend. Proceed to divide as if both numbers were whole numbers. If, in the quotient, the first nonzero digit occurs to the right of the decimal point, but not in the tenths position, place a zero in each position between the decimal point and the first nonzero digit of the quotient. Sample Set A Find the decimal representations of the following quotients. Example 6.44.  114.1÷7 = 7 Thus, 114.1÷7 = 16.3. Check: If 114.1÷7 = 16.3, then 7⋅16.3 should equal 114.1. Example 6.45.  0.02068÷4 Place zeros in the tenths and hundredths positions. (See Step 3.) Thus, 0.02068÷4 = 0.00517. Practice Set A Find the following quotients. Exercise 6.7.1. (Go to Solution) 184.5÷3 Exercise 6.7.2. (Go to Solution) 16.956÷9 Exercise 6.7.3. (Go to Solution) 0.2964÷4 Exercise 6.7.4. (Go to Solution) 0.000496÷8  || A Method of Dividing a Decimal By a Nonzero Decimal Now that we can divide decimals by nonzero whole numbers, we are in a position to divide decimals by a nonzero decimal. We will do so by converting a division by a decimal into a division by a whole number, a process with which we are already familiar. We'll illustrate the method using this example: Divide 4.32 by 1.8. Let's look at this problem as . The divisor is . We can convert into a whole number if we multiply it by 10. But, we know from our experience with fractions, that if we multiply the denomina­tor of a fraction by a nonzero whole number, we must multiply the numerator by that same nonzero whole number. Thus, when converting to a whole number by multiplying it by 10, we must also multiply the numerator by 10. We have converted the division 4.32÷1.8 into the division 43.2÷18, that is, Notice what has occurred. If we "move" the decimal point of the divisor one digit to the right, we must also "move" the decimal point of the dividend one place to the right. The word "move" actually indicates the process of multiplication by a power of 10. Method of Dividing a Decimal by a Decimal Number To divide a decimal by a nonzero decimal, Convert the divisor to a whole number by moving the decimal point to the position immediately to the right of the divisor's last digit. Move the decimal point of the dividend to the right the same number of digits it was moved in the divisor. Set the decimal point in the quotient by placing a decimal point directly above the newly located decimal point in the dividend. Divide as usual. Sample Set B Find the following quotients. Example 6.46.  32.66÷7.1 The divisor has one decimal place. Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 1 place to the right. Set the decimal point. Divide as usual. Thus, 32.66÷7.1 = 4.6. Check: 32.66÷7.1 = 4.6 if 4.6 × 7.1 = 32.66 Example 6.47.  1.0773÷0.513 The divisor has 3 decimal places. Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 3 places to the right. Set the decimal place and divide. Thus, 1.0773÷0.513 = 2.1. Checking by multiplying 2.1 and 0.513 will convince us that we have obtained the correct result. (Try it.) Example 6.48.  12÷0.00032 The divisor has 5 decimal places. Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 5 places to the right. We will need to add 5 zeros to 12. Set the decimal place and divide. This is now the same as the division of whole numbers. Checking assures us that 12÷0.00032 = 37,500. Practice Set B Find the decimal representation of each quotient. Exercise 6.7.5.

(Go to Solution) 8,162.41÷10,000  || Calculators Calculators can be useful for finding quotients of decimal numbers. As we have seen with the other calculator operations, we can sometimes expect only approximate results. We are alerted to approximate results when the calculator display is filled with digits. We know it is possible that the operation may produce more digits than the calculator has the ability to show. For example, the multiplication produces 5 + 4 = 9 decimal places. An eight-digit display calculator only has the ability to show eight digits, and an approximation results. The way to recognize a possible approximation is illustrated in problem 3 of the next sample set. Sample Set C Find each quotient using a calculator. If the result is an approximation, round to five decimal places. Example 6.49.  12.596÷4.7 Table 6.30.     Display Reads Type 12.596 12.596 Press ÷ 12.596 Type 4.7 4.7 Press = 2.68 Since the display is not filled, we expect this to be an accurate result. Example 6.50.  0.5696376÷0.00123 Table 6.31.     Display Reads Type .5696376 0.5696376 Press ÷ 0.5696376 Type .00123 0.00123 Press = 463.12 Since the display is not filled, we expect this result to be accurate. Example 6.51.  0.8215199÷4.113 Table 6.32.     Display Reads Type .8215199 0.8215199 Press ÷ 0.8215199 Type 4.113 4.113 Press = 0.1997373 There are EIGHT DIGITS — DISPLAY FILLED! BE AWARE OF POSSIBLE APPROXI­MATIONS. We can check for a possible approximation in the following way. Since the division can be checked by multiplying 4 and 3, we can check our division by performing the multiplication This multiplication produces 3 + 7 = 10 decimal digits. But our suspected quotient contains only 8 decimal digits. We conclude that the answer is an approximation. Then, rounding to five decimal places, we get 0.19974.

Let's look at each of these again and then, from these observations, make a general statement regarding division of a decimal num­ber by a power of 10. Thus, 8,162.41÷10 = 816.241. Notice that the divisor 10 is composed of one 0 and that the quotient 816.241 can be obtained from the dividend 8,162.41 by moving the decimal point one place to the left. Thus, 8,162.41÷100 = 81.6241. Notice that the divisor 100 is composed of two 0's and that the quotient 81.6241 can be obtained from the dividend by moving the decimal point two places to the left. Using these observations, we can suggest the following method for dividing decimal numbers by powers of 10. Dividing a Decimal Fraction by a Power of 10 To divide a decimal fraction by a power of 10, move the decimal point of the decimal fraction to the left as many places as there are zeros in the power of 10. Add zeros if necessary. Sample Set D Find each quotient. Example 6.52.  9,248.6÷100 Since there are 2 zeros in this power of 10, we move the decimal point 2 places to the left. Example 6.53.  3.28÷10,000 Since there are 4 zeros in this power of 10, we move the decimal point 4 places to the left. To do so, we need to add three zeros.

A terminating division is a division in which the quotient terminates after several divisions (the remainder is zero). Exact Divisions The quotient in this problem terminates in the tenths position. Terminating divi­sions are also called exact divisions. Nonterminating Division The division in example 2 is an example of a nonterminating division. A non-terminating division is a division that, regardless of how far we carry it out, always has a remainder. Repeating Decimal We can see that the pattern in the brace is repeated endlessly. Such a decimal quotient is called a repeating decimal.  || Denoting Nonterminating Quotients We use three dots at the end of a number to indicate that a pattern repeats itself endlessly. 4 ÷ 3 = 1 . 333 … Another way, aside from using three dots, of denoting an endlessly repeating pattern is to write a bar ( ¯ ) above the repeating sequence of digits. The bar indicates the repeated pattern of 3. Repeating patterns in a division can be discovered in two ways: As the division process progresses, should the remainder ever be the same as the dividend, it can be concluded that the division is nonterminating and that the pattern in the quotient repeats. This fact is illustrated in Example 6.54 of the section called “Sample Set A”. As the division process progresses, should the "product, difference" pattern ever repeat two consecutive times, it can be concluded that the division is nonter­minating and that the pattern in the quotient repeats. This fact is illustrated in Example 6.55 and 4 of the section called “Sample Set A”. Sample Set A Carry out each division until the repeating pattern can be determined. Example 6.54.  100 ÷ 27 When the remainder is identical to the dividend, the division is nonterminating. This implies that the pattern in the quotient repeats. 100÷27 = 3.70370370… The repeating block is 703. Example 6.55.  1 ÷ 9 We see that this “product, difference”pattern repeats. We can conclude that the division is nonterminating and that the quotient repeats. 1÷9 = 0.111… The repeating block is 1. Example 6.56.  Divide 2 by 11 and round to 3 decimal places. Since we wish to round the quotient to three decimal places, we'll carry out the division so that the quotient has four decimal places. The number .1818 rounded to three decimal places is .182. Thus, correct to three decimal places, 2 ÷ 11 = 0 . 182 Example 6.57.  Divide 1 by 6. We see that this “product, difference” pattern repeats. We can conclude that the division is nonterminating and that the quotient repeats at the 6. Practice Set A Carry out the following divisions until the repeating pattern can be determined.
