 || Definition of Subtraction We know from experience with arithmetic that the subtraction 5 – 2 produces 3, that is 5 – 2 = 3. We can suggest a rule for subtracting signed numbers by illus­trating this process on the number line. Begin at 0, the origin. Since 5 is positive, move 5 units to the right. Then, move 2 units to the left to get to 6. (This reminds us of addition with a negative number.) From this illustration we can see that 5 – 2 is the same as 5 + ( – 2). This leads us directly to the definition of subtraction. Definition of Subtraction If a and b are real numbers, a – b is the same as a + ( – b), where – b is the opposite of b .  || The Process of Subtraction From this definition, we suggest the following rule for subtracting signed numbers. Subtraction of Signed Numbers To perform the subtraction a – b , add the opposite of b to a , that is, change the sign of b and add. Sample Set A Perform the indicated subtractions. Example 10.26.  5 − 3 = 5 + ( − 3) = 2 Example 10.27.  4 – 9 = 4 + ( – 9) = – 5 Example 10.28.  − 4 − 6 = − 4 + ( − 6) = − 10 Example 10.29.  − 3 − ( − 12) = − 3 + 12 = 9 Example 10.30.  0 – ( – 15) = 0 + 15 = 15 Example 10.31.  The high temperature today in Lake Tahoe was 26°F. The low temperature tonight is expected to be -7°F. How many degrees is the temperature expected to drop? We need to find the difference between 26 and -7. 26 – ( – 7 ) = 26 + 7 = 33 Thus, the expected temperature drop is 33°F. Example 10.32.  Practice Set A Perform the indicated subtractions.

The most efficient calculators are those with a key. Sample Set B Use a calculator to find each difference. Example 10.33.  3,187 − 8,719 Table 10.2. Display Reads Type 3187 3187 Press - 3187 Type 8719 8719 Press = -5532 Thus, 3,187 − 8,719 = − 5,532. Example 10.34.  − 156 − ( − 211) Method A: Table 10.3. Display Reads Type 156 156 Press -156 Type - -156 Press 211 211 Type -211 Press = 55 Thus, − 156 − ( − 211) = 55. Method B: We manually change the subtraction to an addition and change the sign of the number to be subtracted. − 156 − ( − 211) becomes − 156 + 211 Table 10.4.
