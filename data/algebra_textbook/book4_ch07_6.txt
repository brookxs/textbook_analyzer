 || Conversions Involving Fractions of One Percent Percents such as %, %, %, and %, where 1% has not been attained, are fractions of 1%. This implies that Since "percent" means "for each hundred," and "of" means "times," we have Sample Set A Example 7.31.  Convert % to a fraction. Example 7.32.  Convert % to a decimal. Practice Set A Exercise 7.6.1. (Go to Solution) Convert % to a fraction. Exercise 7.6.2. (Go to Solution) Convert % to a fraction. Exercise 7.6.3. (Go to Solution) Convert % to a fraction.  || Conversions Involving Nonterminating Fractions We must be careful when changing a fraction of 1% to a decimal. The number , as we know, has a nonterminating decimal representation. Therefore, it cannot be expressed exactly as a decimal. When converting nonterminating fractions of 1% to decimals, it is customary to express the fraction as a rounded decimal with at least three decimal places. Converting a Nonterminating Fraction to a Decimal To convert a nonterminating fraction of 1% to a decimal: Convert the fraction as a rounded decimal. Move the decimal point two digits to the left and remove the percent sign. Sample Set B Example 7.33.  Convert % to a three-place decimal. Convert to a decimal. Since we wish the resulting decimal to have three decimal digits, and removing the percent sign will account for two of them, we need to round to one place (2 + 1 = 3). % to one decimal place. Move the decimal point two digits to the left and remove the % sign. We'll need to add zeros to locate the decimal point in the correct location. to 3 decimal places Example 7.34.  Convert % to a four-place decimal. Since we wish the resulting decimal to have four decimal places, and removing the percent sign will account for two, we to round to two places. to two decimal places. Move the decimal point two places to the left and drop the percent sign. to four decimal places. Example 7.35.  Convert % to a decimal rounded to ten thousandths. Since we wish the resulting decimal to be rounded to ten thousandths (four decimal places), and removing the percent sign will account for two, we need to round to two places. to two decimal places. Move the decimal point to the left two places and drop the percent sign. correct to ten thousandths. Practice Set B Exercise 7.6.4. (Go to Solution) Convert % to a three-place decimal. Exercise 7.6.5. (Go to Solution) Convert to a decimal rounded to ten thousandths.  ||
