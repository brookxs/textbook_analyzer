Raising a Quotient to a Power Raising a quotient to a power is similar to raising a product to a power. For example, raising (x/y)3 requires that we write x/y as a factor three times.( x y )3 = x y · x y · x y = x · x · x y · y · y = x3 y3 5.5. LAWS OF EXPONENTS 351 However, it is much simpler to realize that when you raise a quotient to a power, you raise both numerator and denominator to that power. In symbols:( x y )3 = x3 y3 This leads to the fifth and final law of exponents. Raising a Quotient to a Power. To raise a quotient to a power, raise both numerator and denominator to that power. Given b != 0,(a b )n = an bn You Try It! EXAMPLE 12. Simplify each of the following expressions: Simplify: ( 5 4 )3 (a) ( 2 3 )2 (b) (x 3 )3 (c) ( −2 y )4 Solution: In each example we are raising a quotient to a power. Hence, in each case, we raise both numerator and denominator to that power. (a) ( 2 3 )2 = 22 32 = 4 9 (b) (x 3 )3 = x3 33 = x3 27 (c) ( −2 y )4 = 24 y4 = 16 y4 Note that in example (c), raising a negative base to an even power produces a positive result. With a little practice, each of the examples can be simplified mentally. Raise numerator and denominator to the indicated power in your head: (2/3)2 = 4/9, (x/3)3 = x3/27, and (−2/y)4 = 16/y4 Answer: 125 64 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 13. Simplify: ( 2x5 y3 )2 Simplify: ( a4 3b2 )3 Solution: Raise both numerator and denominator to the second power, then simplify.( 2x5 y3 )2 = (2x5)2 (y3)2 Raise numerator and denominator to the second power. 352 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS In the numerator, we need to raise each factor of the product to the second power. Then we need to remind ourselves that when we raise a power to a power, we multiply the exponents. = 22(x5)2 (y3)2 Raise each factor in the numerator to the second power = 4x10 y6 Simplify: 22 = 4, (x5)2 = x10, and (y3)2 = y6.
