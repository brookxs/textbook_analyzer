Base, Percent, and Percentage There are three basic types of percent problems. Each type involves a base, a percent, and a percentage, and when they are translated from words to mathemati­cal symbols each becomes a multiplication statement. Examples of these types of problems are the following: What number is 30% of 50? (Missing product statement.) 15 is what percent of 50? (Missing factor statement.) 15 is 30% of what number? (Missing factor statement.) In problem 1, the product is missing. To solve the problem, we represent the missing product with P . P = 30% ⋅ 50 Percentage The missing product P is called the percentage. Percentage means part, or por­tion. In P = 30% ⋅50, P represents a particular part of 50. In problem 2, one of the factors is missing. Here we represent the missing factor with Q . 15 = Q ⋅ 50 Percent The missing factor is the percent. Percent, we know, means per 100, or part of 100. In 15 = Q ⋅50, Q indicates what part of 50 is being taken or considered. Specifi­cally, 15 = Q ⋅50 means that if 50 was to be divided into 100 equal parts, then Q indicates 15 are being considered. In problem 3, one of the factors is missing. Represent the missing factor with B . 15 = 30% ⋅ B Base The missing factor is the base. Some meanings of base are a source of supply, or a starting place. In 15 = 30% ⋅B , B indicates the amount of supply. Specifically, 15 = 30% ⋅B indicates that 15 represents 30% of the total supply. Each of these three types of problems is of the form ( percentage ) = ( percent ) ⋅ ( base ) We can determine any one of the three values given the other two using the methods discussed in Section 4.7.
