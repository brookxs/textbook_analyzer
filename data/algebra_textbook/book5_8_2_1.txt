Simple Radical Form We can also use the property √ a √ b = √ ab in reverse to factor out a perfect square. For example: √ 50 = √ 25 √ 2 Factor out a perfect square. = 5 √ 2 Simplify: √ 25 = 5. The expression 5 √ 2 is said to be in simple radical form. Like reducing a fraction to lowest terms, you should always look to factor out a perfect square when possible. Simple radical form. If possible, always factor out a perfect square. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Place √ 8 in simple radical form.Place √ 12 in simple radical form. Solution: From √ 8, we can factor out a perfect square, in this case √ 4. √ 8 = √ 4 √ 2 Factor out a perfect square. = 2 √ 2 Simplify: √ 4 = 2. Answer: 2 √ 3 ! Sometimes, after factoring out a perfect square, you can still factor out another perfect square. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Place √ 72 in simple radical form.Place √ 200 in simple radical form. Solution: From √ 72, we can factor out a perfect square, in this case √ 9. √ 72 = √ 9 √ 8 Factor out a perfect square. = 3 √ 8 Simplify: √ 9 = 3. 8.2. SIMPLIFYING RADICAL EXPRESSIONS 549 However, from √ 8 we can factor out another perfect square, in this case √ 4. = 3 √ 4 √ 2 Factor out another perfect square. = 3 · 2 ·√2 Simplify: √4 = 2. = 6 √ 2 Multiply: 3 · 2 = 6. Alternate solution. We can simplify the process by noting that we can factor out √ 36 from √ 72 to start the process. √ 72 = √ 36 √ 2 Factor out a perfect square. = 6 √ 2 Simplify: √ 36 = 6. Although the second solution is more efficient, the first solution is still math- ematically correct. The point to make here is that we must continue to factor out a perfect square whenever possible. Our answer is not in simple radical form until we can no longer factor out a perfect square. Answer: 10 √ 2 ! Simple Radical Form We can also use the property √ a √ b = √ ab in reverse to factor out a perfect square. For example: √ 50 = √ 25 √ 2 Factor out a perfect square. = 5 √ 2 Simplify: √ 25 = 5.
