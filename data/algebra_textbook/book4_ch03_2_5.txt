Reading Exponential Notation In a number such as 85 , Base 8 is called the base. Exponent, Power 5 is called the exponent, or power. 85 is read as "eight to the fifth power," or more simply as "eight to the fifth," or "the fifth power of eight." Squared When a whole number is raised to the second power, it is said to be squared. The number 52 can be read as 5 to the second power, or 5 to the second, or 5 squared. Cubed When a whole number is raised to the third power, it is said to be cubed. The number 53 can be read as 5 to the third power, or 5 to the third, or 5 cubed. When a whole number is raised to the power of 4 or higher, we simply say that that number is raised to that particular power. The number 58 can be read as 5 to the eighth power, or just 5 to the eighth. Reading Exponential Notation In a number such as 85 , Base 8 is called the base.
