Parallel Lines Recall that slope is a number that measures the steepness of the line. If two lines are parallel (never intersect), they have the same steepness. Parallel lines. If two lines are parallel, they have the same slope. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Sketch the line y = 34x − 2, then sketch the line passing Find the equation of the line which passes through the point (2,−3) and is parallel to the line y = 3 2 x+ 1. through the point (−1, 1) that is parallel to the line y = 34x − 2. Find the equation of this parallel line. Solution: Note that y = 34x− 2 is in slope-intercept form y = mx+ b. Hence, its slope is 3/4 and its y-intercept is (0,−2). Plot the y-intercept (0,−2), move up 3 units, right 4 units, then draw the line (see Figure 3.74). −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 3 ∆x = 4 (0,−2) Figure 3.74: The line y = 34x− 2. −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 3 ∆x = 4 (−1, 1) Figure 3.75: Adding a line parallel to y = 34x− 2. The second line must be parallel to the first, so it must have the same slope 3/4. Plot the point (−1, 1), move up 3 units, right 4 units, then draw the line (see the red line in Figure 3.75). 218 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING To find the equation of the parallel red line in Figure 3.75, use the point- slope form, substitute 3/4 for m, then (−1, 1) for (x0, y0). That is, substitute −1 for x0 and 1 for y0. y − y0 = m(x− x0) Point-slope form. y − 1 = 3 4 ( x− (−1)) Substitute: 3/4 for m, −1 for x0, and 1 for y0. y − 1 = 3 4 (x+ 1) Simplify. Check: In this example, we were not required to solve for y, so we can save ourselves some checking work by writing the equation y − 1 = 3 4 (x+ 1) in the form y = 3 4 (x+ 1) + 1 by adding 1 to both sides of the first equation. Next, enter each equation as shown in Figure 3.76, then change the WINDOW setting as shown in Figure 3.77. Figure 3.76: Enter equations of parallel lines.
