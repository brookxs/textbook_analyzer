 || Addition and Subtraction (+, −) Visualize adding 3 + 2 on the number line by moving from zero three units to the right then another two units to the right, as illustrated below: The illustration shows that 3 + 2 = 5. Similarly, visualize adding two negative numbers (−3) + (−2) by first moving from the origin three units to the left and then moving another two units to the left. In this example, the illustration shows (−3) + (−2) = −5, which leads to the following two properties of real numbers. Next, we will explore addition of numbers with unlike signs. To add 3 + (−7), first move from the origin three units to the right, then move seven units to the left as shown: In this case, we can see that adding a negative number is equivalent to subtraction: It is tempting to say that a positive number plus a negative number is negative, but that is not always true: 7 + ( − 3 ) = 7 − 3 = 4 . The result of adding numbers with unlike signs may be positive or negative. The sign of the result is the same as the sign of the number with the greatest distance from the origin. For example, the following results depend on the sign of the number 12 because it is farther from zero than 5:   Example 1: Simplify: 14 + ( − 25 ) . Solution: Here −25 is the greater distance from the origin. Therefore, the result is negative. Answer: −11   Given any real numbers a, b, and c, we have the following properties of addition: Additive identity property Given any real number a, a + 0 = 0 + a = a   . : a + 0 = 0 + a = a Additive inverse property Given any real number a, a + ( − a ) = ( − a ) + a = 0 . : a + ( − a ) = ( − a ) + a = 0 Associative property Given real numbers a, b and c, ( a + b ) + c = a + ( b + c ) . : ( a + b ) + c = a + ( b + c ) Commutative property Given real numbers a and b, a + b = b + a . : a + b = b + a   Example 2: Simplify: a. 5 + 0 b. 10 + ( − 10 ) Solution: a. Adding zero to any real number results in the same real number. b. Adding opposites results in zero. Answers: a. 5; b. 0   Example 3: Simplify: a. ( 3 + 7 ) + 4 b. 3 + ( 7 + 4 ) Solution: Parentheses group the operations that are to be performed first. a. b. These two examples both result in 14: changing the grouping of the numbers does not change the result. Answers: a. 14; b. 14   At this point, we highlight the fact that addition is commutative: the order in which we add does not matter and yields the same result. On the other hand, subtraction is not commutative. We will use these properties, along with the double-negative property for real numbers, to perform more involved sequential operations. To simplify things, we will make it a general rule to first replace all sequential operations with either addition or subtraction and then perform each operation in order from left to right.   Example 4: Simplify: 4 − ( − 10 ) + ( − 5 ) . Solution: Replace the sequential operations and then perform them from left to right. Answer: 9   Example 5: Simplify: − 3 + ( − 8 ) − ( − 7 ) . Solution: Answer: −4   Try this! Simplify: 12 − ( − 9 ) + ( − 6 ) . Answer: 15 Video Solution Often we find the need to translate English sentences involving addition and subtraction to mathematical statements. Listed below are some key words that translate to the given operation. Key Words Operation Sum, increased by, more than, plus, added to, total + Difference, decreased by, subtracted from, less, minus −   Example 6: What is the difference of 7 and −3? Solution: The key word “difference” implies that we should subtract the numbers. Answer: The difference of 7 and −3 is 10.   Example 7: What is the sum of the first five positive integers? Solution: The initial key word to focus on is “sum”; this means that we will be adding the five numbers. The first five positive integers are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Recall that 0 is neither positive nor negative. Answer: The sum of the first five positive integers is 15.   Example 8: What is 10 subtracted from the sum of 8 and 6? Solution: We know that subtraction is not commutative; therefore, we must take care to subtract in the correct order. First, add 8 and 6 and then subtract 10 as follows: It is important to notice that the phrase “10 subtracted from” does not translate to a mathematical statement in the order it appears. In other words, 10 − ( 8 + 6 ) would be an incorrect translation and leads to an incorrect answer. After translating the sentence, perform the operations. Answer: Ten subtracted from the sum of 8 and 6 is 4.  || Distance on a Number Line One application of the absolute value is to find the distance between any two points on a number line. For real numbers a and b, the distance formula for a number line The distance between any two real numbers a and b on a number line can be calculated using the formula d = | b − a | . is given as,   Example 9: Determine the distance between 2 and 7 on a number line. Solution: On the graph we see that the distance between the two given integers is 5 units. Using the distance formula we obtain the same result. Answer: 5 units   Example 10: Determine the distance between −4 and 7 on a number line. Solution: Use the distance formula for a number line d = | b − a | , where a = − 4 and b = 7 . Answer: 11 units   It turns out that it does not matter which points are used for a and b; the absolute value always ensures a positive result. Using a = −4 and b = 7 Using a = 7 and b = −4 d = | 7 − ( − 4 ) | = | 7 + 4 | = | 11 | = 11 d = | − 4 − 7 | = | − 11 | = 11   Try this! Determine the distance between −12 and −9 on the number line.
