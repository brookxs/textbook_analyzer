Vertical Lines A vertical line presents a different problem. If you look at the formula , you see that there is a problem with the denominator. It is not possible to get two different values for xl and x2, because if x changes then you are not on the vertical line anymore. Any two points on a vertical line will have the same x coordinates, and so x2 – x1 = 0. Since the denominator of a fraction cannot be zero, we have to say that a vertical line has undefined slope. Do not confuse this with the case of the horizontal line, which has a well-defined slope that just happens to equal zero. Vertical Lines A vertical line presents a different problem.
