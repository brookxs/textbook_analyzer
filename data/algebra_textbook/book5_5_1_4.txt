Function Notation Although the mapping diagram notation f : x→ 3− 4x is quite easy to understand, the standard function notation used is f(x) = 3− 4x. With mapping diagram notation, if we want to answer the question “where does f send 12?”, we write: f : x→ 3− 4x f : 12→ 3− 4(12) f : 12→ 3− 48 f : 12→ −45 Hence, f : 12 → −45; i.e., f sends 12 to −45. Function notation uses exactly the same concept; i.e, substitute 12 for x. 302 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Tips for Using Function Notation. 1. Replace all occurrences of variables in the notation with open parentheses. Leave room between the parentheses to substitute the given value of the variable. 2. Substitute the given values of variables in the open parentheses prepared in the first step. 3. Evaluate the resulting expression according to the Rules Guiding Order of Operations. Given f(x) = 3−4x, to evaluate f(12), first restate the function notation, then replace each occurrence of the variable with open parentheses. f(x) = 3− 4x Original function notation. f( ) = 3− 4( ) Replace each occurrence of x with open parentheses. Now substitute 12 for x in the open parentheses prepared in the last step. f(12) = 3− 4(12) Substitute 12 for x in the open parentheses positions. f(12) = 3− 48 Multiply. f(12) = −45 Subtract. Hence, f(12) = −45; i.e., f sends 12 to −45. You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Given f(x) = 4− 5x− x2, evaluate f(−3). Solution: Start by replacing each occurrence of the variable x with open parentheses. f(x) = 4− 5x− x2 Original function notation. f( ) = 4− 5( )− ( )2 Replace each occurrence of x with open parentheses.

Thus, f(−1) = 6. We’re next asked to find g(−2).
