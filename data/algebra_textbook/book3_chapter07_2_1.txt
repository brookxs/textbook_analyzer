Multiplication and Division Same rules as for rational numbers! Multiplication Both the numerators and the denominators multiply together Common factors may be cancelled before multiplying Example:    Given Equation: First factor all the expressions: (I also put the denominators in parentheses because then it is easier to see them as distinct factors) Now cancel common factors—any factor on the top can cancel with any factor on the bottom: Now just multiply what’s left. You usually do not have to multiply out the factors, just leave them as shown.   Division Multiply by the reciprocal of the divisor Invert the second fraction, then proceed with multiplication as above Do not attempt to cancel factors before it is written as a multiplication Multiplication and Division Same rules as for rational numbers!
