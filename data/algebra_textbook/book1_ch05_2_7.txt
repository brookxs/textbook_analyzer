Solving Equation of the form x + a = b and x − a = b Recall that the equal sign of an equation indicates that the number represented by the expression on the left side is the same as the number represented by the expression on the right side. This suggests the following procedures: We can obtain an equivalent equation (an equation having the same solutions as the original equation) by adding the same number to both sides of the equation. We can obtain an equivalent equation by subtracting the same number from both sides of the equation. We can use these results to isolate x , thus solving for x . Example 5.4. Solving x + a = b for x Example 5.5. Solving x − a = b for x Example 5.6. Method for Solving x + a = b and x − a = b for x To solve the equation x + a = b for x , subtract a from both sides of the equation. To solve the equation x − a = b for x , add a to both sides of the equation.
