The Five-Step Method We are now in a position to study some applications of rational equations. Some of these problems will have practical applications while others are intended as logic developers. We will apply the five-step method for solving word problems. Five-Step Method Represent all unknown quantities in terms of x or some other letter. Translate the verbal phrases to mathematical symbols and form an equation. Solve this equation. Check the solution by substituting the result into the original statement of the problem. Write the conclusion. Remember, step 1 is very important: always Introduce a variable. The Five-Step Method We are now in a position to study some applications of rational equations.
