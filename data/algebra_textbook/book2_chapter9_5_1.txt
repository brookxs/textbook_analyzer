The Graph of a Quadratic Equation We know that any linear equation with two variables can be written in the form y = m x + b and that its graph is a line. In this section, we will see that any quadratic equation of the form y = a x 2 + b x + c has a curved graph called a parabola The graph of any quadratic equation y = a x 2 + b x + c , where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0 . . Two points determine any line. However, since a parabola is curved, we should find more than two points. In this text, we will determine at least five points as a means to produce an acceptable sketch. To begin, we graph our first parabola by plotting points. Given a quadratic equation of the form y = a x 2 + b x + c , x is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable. Choose some values for x and then determine the corresponding y-values. Then plot the points and sketch the graph.   Example 1: Graph by plotting points: y = x 2 − 2 x − 3 . Solution: In this example, choose the x-values {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and calculate the corresponding y-values. Plot these points and determine the shape of the graph. Answer: When graphing, we want to include certain special points in the graph. The y-intercept is the point where the graph intersects the y-axis. The x-intercepts are the points where the graph intersects the x-axis. The vertex The point that defines the minimum or maximum of a parabola. is the point that defines the minimum or maximum of the graph. Lastly, the line of symmetry The vertical line through the vertex, x = − b 2 a , about which the parabola is symmetric. (also called the axis of symmetry A term used when referencing the line of symmetry. ) is the vertical line through the vertex, about which the parabola is symmetric. For any parabola, we will find the vertex and y-intercept. In addition, if the x-intercepts exist, then we will want to determine those as well. Guessing at the x-values of these special points is not practical; therefore, we will develop techniques that will facilitate finding them. Many of these techniques will be used extensively as we progress in our study of algebra. Given a quadratic equation of the form y = a x 2 + b x + c , find the y-intercept by setting x = 0 and solving. In general, y = a ( 0 ) 2 + b ( 0 ) + c = c , and we have Next, recall that the x-intercepts, if they exist, can be found by setting y = 0 . Doing this, we have 0 = a 2 + b x + c , which has general solutions given by the quadratic formula, x = − b ± b 2 − 4 a c √ 2 a . Therefore, the x-intercepts have this general form: Using the fact that a parabola is symmetric, we can determine the vertical line of symmetry using the x-intercepts. To do this, we find the x-value midway between the x-intercepts by taking an average as follows: Therefore, the line of symmetry is the vertical line: We can use the line of symmetry to find the x-value of the vertex. The steps for graphing a parabola are outlined in the following example.   Example 2: Graph: y = − x 2 − 2 x + 3 . Solution: Step 1: Determine the y-intercept. To do this, set x = 0 and solve for y. The y-intercept is (0, 3). Step 2: Determine the x-intercepts. To do this, set y = 0 and solve for x. Here when y = 0, we obtain two solutions. There are two x-intercepts, (−3, 0) and (1, 0). Step 3: Determine the vertex. One way to do this is to use the equation for the line of symmetry, x = − b 2 a , to find the x-value of the vertex. In this example, a = −1 and b = −2: Substitute −1 into the original equation to find the corresponding y-value. The vertex is (−1, 4). Step 4: Determine extra points so that we have at least five points to plot. In this example, one other point will suffice. Choose x = −2 and find the corresponding y-value. Our fifth point is (−2, 3). Step 5: Plot the points and sketch the graph. To recap, the points that we have found are y-intercept: (0, 3) x-intercept: (−3, 0) and (1, 0) Vertex: (−1, 4) Extra point: (−2, 3) Answer: The parabola opens downward. In general, use the leading coefficient to determine whether the parabola opens upward or downward. If the leading coefficient is negative, as in the previous example, then the parabola opens downward. If the leading coefficient is positive, then the parabola opens upward. All quadratic equations of the form y = a x 2 + b x + c have parabolic graphs with y-intercept (0, c). However, not all parabolas have x intercepts.   Example 3: Graph: y = 2 x 2 + 4 x + 5 . Solution: Because the leading coefficient 2 is positive, note that the parabola opens upward. Here c = 5 and the y-intercept is (0, 5). To find the x-intercepts, set y = 0. In this case, a = 2, b = 4, and c = 5. Use the discriminant to determine the number and type of solutions. Since the discriminant is negative, we conclude that there are no real solutions. Because there are no real solutions, there are no x-intercepts. Next, we determine the x-value of the vertex. Given that the x-value of the vertex is −1, substitute into the original equation to find the corresponding y-value. The vertex is (−1, 3). So far, we have only two points. To determine three more, choose some x-values on either side of the line of symmetry, x = −1. Here we choose x-values −3, −2, and 1. To summarize, we have y-intercept: (0, 5) x-intercepts: None Vertex: (−1, 3) Extra points: (−3, 11), (−2, 5), (1, 11) Plot the points and sketch the graph. Answer:   Example 4: Graph: y = − 2 x 2 + 12 x − 18 . Solution: Note that a = −2: the parabola opens downward. Since c = −18, the y-intercept is (0, −18). To find the x-intercepts, set y = 0. Solve by factoring. Here x = 3 is a double root, so there is only one x-intercept, (3, 0). From the original equation, a = −2, b = 12, and c = −18. The x-value of the vertex can be calculated as follows: Given that the x-value of the vertex is 3, substitute into the original equation to find the corresponding y-value. Therefore, the vertex is (3, 0), which happens to be the same point as the x-intercept. So far, we have only two points. To determine three more, choose some x-values on either side of the line of symmetry, x = 3 in this case. Choose x-values 1, 5, and 6. To summarize, we have y-intercept: (0, −18) x-intercept: (3, 0) Vertex: (3, 0) Extra points: (1, −8), (5, −8), (6, −18) Plot the points and sketch the graph. Answer:   Example 5: Graph: y = x 2 − 2 x − 1 . Solution: Since a = 1, the parabola opens upward. Furthermore, c = −1, so the y-intercept is (0, −1). To find the x-intercepts, set y = 0. In this case, solve using the quadratic formula with a = 1, b = −2, and c = −1. Here we obtain two real solutions for x, and thus there are two x-intercepts: Approximate values using a calculator: Use the approximate answers to place the ordered pair on the graph. However, we will present the exact x-intercepts on the graph. Next, find the vertex. Given that the x-value of the vertex is 1, substitute into the original equation to find the corresponding y-value. The vertex is (1, −2). We need one more point. To summarize, we have y-intercept: (0, −1) x-intercepts: ( 1 − 2 √ , 0) and ( 1 + 2 √ , 0) Vertex: (1, −2) Extra point: (2, −1) Plot the points and sketch the graph. Answer:   Try this!
