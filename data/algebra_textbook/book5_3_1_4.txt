Graphing Equations in Two Variables Let’s first define what is meant by the graph of an equation in two variables. The graph of an equation. The graph of an equation is the set of all points that satisfy the given equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Sketch the graph of the equation y = x+ 1. Sketch the graph of the equation y = −x+ 2. Solution: The definition requires that we plot all points in the Cartesian Coordinate System that satisfy the equation y = x + 1. Let’s first create a table of points that satisfy the equation. Start by creating three columns with headers x, y, and (x, y), then select some values for x and put them in the first column. 158 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING Take the first value of x, namely x = −3, and substitute it into the equation y = x+ 1. y = x+ 1 y = −3 + 1 y = −2 Thus, when x = −3, we have y = −2. Enter this value into the table. x y = x+ 1 (x, y) −3 −2 (−3,−2) −2 −1 0 1 2 3 Continue substituting each tabular value of x into the equation y = x+ 1 and use each result to complete the corresponding entries in the table. x y = x+ 1 (x, y) y = −3 + 1 = −2 −3 −2 (−3,−2) y = −2 + 1 = −1 −2 −1 (−2,−1) y = −1 + 1 = 0 −1 0 (−1, 0) y = 0 + 1 = 1 0 1 (0, 1) y = 1 + 1 = 2 1 2 (1, 2) y = 2 + 1 = 3 2 3 (2, 3) y = 3 + 1 = 4 3 4 (3, 4) The last column of the table now contains seven points that satisfy the equation y = x+1. Plot these points on a Cartesian Coordinate System (see Figure 3.7). −5 5 −5 5 x y Figure 3.7: Seven points that sat- isfy the equation y = x+ 1. −5 5 −5 5 x y Figure 3.8: Adding additional points to the graph of y = x+ 1. In Figure 3.7, we have plotted seven points that satisfy the given equation y = x+ 1. However, the definition requires that we plot all points that satisfy the equation. It appears that a pattern is developing in Figure 3.7, but let’s calculate and plot a few more points in order to be sure. Add the x-values 3.1. GRAPHING EQUATIONS BY HAND 159 −2.5, −1.5, −0.5, 05, 1.5, and 2.5 to the x-column of the table, then use the equation y = x+ 1 to evaluate y at each one of these x-values. x y = x+ 1 (x, y) y = −2.5 + 1 = −1.5 −2.5 −1.5 (−2.5,−1.5) y = −1.5 + 1 = −0.5 −1.5 −0.5 (−1.5,−0.5) y = −0.5 + 1 = 0.5 −0.5 0.5 (−0.5, 0.5) y = 0.5 + 1 = 1.5 0.5 1.5 (0.5, 1.5) y = 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 1.5 2.5 (1.5, 2.5) y = 2.5 + 1 = 3.5 2.5 3.5 (2.5, 3.5) Add these additional points to the graph in Figure 3.7 to produce the image shown in Figure 3.8. There are an infinite number of points that satisfy the equation y = x+ 1. In Figure 3.8, we’ve plotted only 13 points that satisfy the equation. However, the collection of points plotted in Figure 3.8 suggest that if we were to plot the remainder of the points that satisfy the equation y = x + 1, we would get the graph of the line shown in Figure 3.9. −5 5 −5 5 x y y = x+ 1 Figure 3.9: The graph of y = x+ 1 is a line.
