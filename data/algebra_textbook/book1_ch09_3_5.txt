Square Roots Not Involving Fractions A square root that does not involve fractions is in simplified form if there are no perfect square in the radicand. The square roots are in simplified form since none of the radicands contains a perfect square. The square roots are not in simplified form since each radicand contains a perfect square. To simplify a square root expression that does not involve a fraction, we can use the following two rules: SIMPLIFYING SQUARE ROOTS WITHOUT FRACTIONS If a factor of the radicand contains a variable with an even exponent, the square root is obtained by dividing the exponent by 2. If a factor of the radicand contains a variable with an odd exponent, the square root is obtained by first factoring the variable factor into two factors so that one has an even exponent and the other has an exponent of 1, then using the product property of square roots.
