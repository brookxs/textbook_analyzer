The Process Let’s consider the expression There are two ways to look at the simplification process: We are asking, “How many square roots of 3 do we have?” means we have 4 “square roots of 3” means we have 8 “square roots of 3”Thus, altogether we have 12 “square roots of 3.” We can also use the idea of combining like terms. If we recall, the process of combining like terms is based on the distributive propertyWe could simplify using the distributive property. Both methods will give us the same result. The first method is probably a bit quicker, but keep in mind, however, that the process works because it is based on one of the basic rules of algebra, the distributive property of real numbers.
