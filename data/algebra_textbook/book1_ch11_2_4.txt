Graphs of Systems of Equations One method of solving a system of equations is by graphing. We know that the graph of a linear equation in two variables is a straight line. The graph of a system will consist of two straight lines. When two straight lines are graphed, one of three possibilities may result. Example 11.1.  The lines intersect at the point ( a, b ) . The point ( a, b ) is the solution to the corresponding system. Example 11.2.  The lines are parallel. They do not intersect. The system has no solution. Example 11.3.  The lines are coincident (one on the other). They intersect at infinitely many points. The system has infinitely many solutions.
