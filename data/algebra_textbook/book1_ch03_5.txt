 || Definition of Subtraction We know from our experience with arithmetic that the subtraction 5 − 2 produces 3, that is, 5 − 2 = 3 . Illustrating this process on the number line suggests a rule for subtracting signed numbers. We begin at 0, the origin. Since 5 is positive, we move 5 units to the right. Then, we move 2 units to the left to get to 3. (This reminds us of addition with a negative number.) This illustration suggests that 5 − 2 is the same as 5 + ( − 2) .This leads us directly to the definition of subtraction. Definition of Subtraction If a and b are real numbers, a − b is the same as a + ( − b) , where − b is the opposite of b .  || Subtraction of Signed Numbers The preceding definition suggests the rule for subtracting signed numbers. Subtraction of Signed Numbers To perform the subtraction a − b , add the opposite of b to a , that is, change the sign of b and add.  ||
