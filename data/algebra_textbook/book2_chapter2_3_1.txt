Linear Equations with One Variable and Their Solutions Learning how to solve various algebraic equations is one of the main goals in algebra. This section introduces the basic techniques used for solving linear equations with one variable. An equation Statement indicating that two algebraic expressions are equal. is a statement indicating that two algebraic expressions are equal. A linear equation with one variable An equation that can be written in the general form a x + b = 0 , where a and b are real numbers and a ≠ 0 . , x, is an equation that can be written in the general form a x + b = 0 , where a and b are real numbers and a ≠ 0 . Here are some examples of linear equations, all of which are solved in this section: A solution Any value that can replace the variable in an equation to produce a true statement. to a linear equation is any value that can replace the variable to produce a true statement. The variable in the linear equation 2 x + 3 = 13 is x, and the solution is x = 5 . To verify this, substitute the value 5 for x and check that you obtain a true statement. Alternatively, when an equation is equal to a constant, we can verify a solution by substituting the value for the variable and show that the result is equal to that constant. In this sense, we say that solutions satisfy the equation After replacing the variable with a solution and simplifying, it produces a true statement. .   Example 1: Is x = 3 a solution to − 2 x − 3 = − 9 ? Answer: Yes, it is a solution, because x = 3 satisfies the equation.   Example 2: Is a = − 1 2 a solution to − 10 a + 5 = 25 ? Answer: No, it is not a solution, because a = − 1 2 does not satisfy the equation.   Recall that when evaluating expressions, it is a good practice to first replace all variables with parentheses, then substitute the appropriate values. By making use of parentheses we avoid some common errors when working the order of operations.   Example 3: Is y = − 3 a solution to 2 y − 5 = − y − 14 ? Solution: Answer: Yes, it is a solution, because y = − 3 produces a true statement.   Try this! Is x = − 3 a solution to − 2 x + 5 = − 1 ?
