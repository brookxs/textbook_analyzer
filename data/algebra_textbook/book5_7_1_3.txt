Applying the Laws of Exponents In this section we’ll simplify a few more complicated expressions using the laws of exponents. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Simplify: (2x−2y3)(−3x5y−6)Simplify: (−5x8y−2)(−2x−6y−1) Solution: All the operators involved are multiplication, so the commutative and associative properties of multiplication allow us to change the order and grouping. We’ll show this regrouping here, but this step can be done mentally. (2x−2y3)(−3x5y−6) = [(2)(−3)](x−2x5)(y3y−6) When multiplying, we repeat the base and add the exponents. = −6x−2+5y3+(−6) = −6x3y−3 In the solution above, we’ve probably shown way too much work. It’s far easier to perform all of these steps mentally, multiplying the 2 and the −3, then repeating bases and adding exponents, as in: (2x−2y3)(−3x5y−6) = −6x3y−3 Answer: 10x2y−3 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Simplify: 6x−2y5 9x3y−2Simplify: (10x3y−1) (4x−2y5) Solution: The simplest approach is to first write the expression as a product. 6x−2y5 9x3y−2 = 6 9 · x −2 x3 · y 5 y−2 Reduce 6/9 to lowest terms. Because we are dividing like bases, we repeat the base and subtract the exponents. = 2 3 x−2−3y5−(−2) = 2 3 x−2+(−3)y5+2 = 2 3 x−5y7 7.1. NEGATIVE EXPONENTS 485 In the solution above, we’ve probably shown way too much work. It’s far easier to imagine writing the expression as a product, reducing 6/9, then repeating bases and subtracting exponents, as in: 6x−2y5 9x3y−2 = 2 3 x−5y7 Answer: 5 2 x5y−6 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Simplify: (2x−2y4)−3 Simplify: (3x4y−3)−2 Solution: The fourth law of exponents ((ab)n = anbn) says that when you raise a product to a power, you must raise each factor to that power. So we begin by raising each factor to the minus three power. (2x−2y3)−3 = 2−3(x−2)−3(y4)−3 To raise two to the minus three, we must cube two and invert: 2−3 = 1/8. Secondly, raising a power to a power requires that we repeat the base and multiply exponents. = 1 8 x(−2)(−3)y(4)(−3) = 1 8 x6y−12 In the solution above, we’ve probably shown way too much work. It’s far easier raise each factor to the minus three mentally: 2−3 = 1/8, then multiply each exponent on the remaining factors by −3, as in (2x−2y4)−3 = 1 8 x6y−12 Answer: 1 9 x−8y6 !
