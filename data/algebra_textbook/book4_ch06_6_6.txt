Calculators Calculators can be used to find products of decimal numbers. However, a calculator that has only an eight-digit display may not be able to handle numbers or products that result in more than eight digits. But there are plenty of inexpensive ($50 - $75) calculators with more than eight-digit displays. Sample Set B Find the following products, if possible, using a calculator. Example 6.34.  2.58 ⋅ 8.61 Table 6.18.     Display Reads Type 2.58 2.58 Press × 2.58 Type 8.61 8.61 Press = 22.2138 The product is 22.2138. Example 6.35.  0.006 ⋅ 0.0042 Table 6.19.     Display Reads Type .006 .006 Press × .006 Type .0042 0.0042 Press = 0.0000252 We know that there will be seven decimal places in the product (since 3 + 4 = 7). Since the display shows 7 decimal places, we can assume the product is correct. Thus, the product is 0.0000252. Example 6.36.  0.0026 ⋅ 0.11976 Since we expect 4 + 5 = 9 decimal places in the product, we know that an eight-digit display calculator will not be able to provide us with the exact value. To obtain the exact value, we must use "hand technology." Suppose, however, that we agree to round off this product to three decimal places. We then need only four decimal places on the display. Table 6.20.     Display Reads Type .0026 .0026 Press × .0026 Type .11976 0.11976 Press = 0.0003114 Rounding 0.0003114 to three decimal places we get 0.000. Thus, 0.0026 ⋅ 0.11976 = 0.000 to three decimal places. Practice Set B Use a calculator to find each product. If the calculator will not provide the exact product, round the result to four decimal places. Exercise 6.6.10. (Go to Solution) 5.126 ⋅ 4.08 Exercise 6.6.11.
