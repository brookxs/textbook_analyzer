Integer Subtraction Subtraction is the inverse, or the opposite, of addition. Subtracting Integers. If a and b are any two integers, then: a− b = a+ (−b) Subtracting b is identical to adding the opposite (additive inverse) of b. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Simplify: −13− 27 Simplify: −11− 15 Solution: The “opposite” (additive inverse) of 27 is −27. So, subtracting 27 is the same as adding −27. −13− 27 = −13 + (−27) Subtracting 27 is the same as adding −27. = −50 Add the magnitudes, then prefix the common negative sign. Answer: −26 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Simplify: −27− (−50) Simplify: −18− (−54) 8 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Solution: The “opposite” (additive inverse) of −50 is −(−50), or 50. So, subtracting −50 is the same as adding 50. −27− (−50) = −27 + 50 Subtracting −50 is the same as adding 50. = 23 Subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger magnitude, then prefix the sign of the larger magnitude.Answer: 36 !
