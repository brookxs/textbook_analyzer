 || Subtraction Subtraction Subtraction is the process of determining the remainder when part of the total is removed. Suppose the sum of two whole numbers is 11, and from 11 we remove 4. Using the number line to help our visualization, we see that if we are located at 11 and move 4 units to the left, and thus remove 4 units, we will be located at 7. Thus, 7 units remain when we remove 4 units from 11 units. The Minus Symbol The minus symbol (-) is used to indicate subtraction. For example, 11 − 4 indicates that 4 is to be subtracted from 11. Minuend The number immediately in front of or the minus symbol is called the minuend, and it represents the original number of units. Subtrahend The number immediately following or below the minus symbol is called the subtrahend, and it represents the number of units to be removed. Difference The result of the subtraction is called the difference of the two numbers. For example, in 11 − 4 = 7, 11 is the minuend, 4 is the subtrahend, and 7 is the difference.  || Subtraction as the Opposite of Addition Subtraction can be thought of as the opposite of addition. We show this in the problems in Sample Set A. Sample Set A Example 1.31.  8 − 5 = 3 since 3 + 5 = 8. Example 1.32.  9 − 3 = 6 since 6 + 3 = 9. Practice Set A Complete the following statements. Exercise 1.6.1. (Go to Solution) 7 − 5 = __________ since __________ + 5 = 7. Exercise 1.6.2. (Go to Solution) 9 − 1 = __________ since __________ + 1 = 9. Exercise 1.6.3. (Go to Solution) 17 − 8 = __________ since __________ + 8 = 17.  || The Subtraction Process We'll study the process of the subtraction of two whole numbers by considering the difference between 48 and 35. which we write as 13. Example 1.33. The Process of Subtracting Whole Numbers To subtract two whole numbers, The process Write the numbers vertically, placing corresponding positions in the same column. Subtract the digits in each column. Start at the right, in the ones position, and move to the left, placing the difference at the bottom. Sample Set B Perform the following subtractions. Example 1.34.  Example 1.35.  Example 1.36.  Find the difference between 977 and 235. Write the numbers vertically, placing the larger number on top. Line up the columns properly. The difference between 977 and 235 is 742. Example 1.37.  In Keys County in 1987, there were 809 cable television installations. In Flags County in 1987, there were 1,159 cable television installations. How many more cable television installations were there in Flags County than in Keys County in 1987? We need to determine the difference between 1,159 and 809. There were 350 more cable television installations in Flags County than in Keys County in 1987. Practice Set B Perform the following subtractions. Exercise 1.6.4. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.5. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.6. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.8. (Go to Solution) Find the difference between 88,526 and 26,412. In each of these problems, each bottom digit is less than the corresponding top digit. This may not always be the case. We will examine the case where the bottom digit is greater than the corresponding top digit in the next section.  || Subtraction Involving Borrowing Minuend and Subtrahend It often happens in the subtraction of two whole numbers that a digit in the minuend (top number) will be less than the digit in the same position in the subtrahend (bottom number). This happens when we subtract 27 from 84. We do not have a name for 4 − 7. We need to rename 84 in order to continue. We'll do so as follows: Our new name for 84 is 7 tens + 14 ones. Notice that we converted 8 tens to 7 tens + 1 ten, and then we converted the 1 ten to 10 ones. We then had 14 ones and were able to perform the subtraction. Borrowing The process of borrowing (converting) is illustrated in the problems of Sample Set C. Sample Set C Example 1.38.  Borrow 1 ten from the 8 tens. This leaves 7 tens. Convert the 1 ten to 10 ones. Add 10 ones to 4 ones to get 14 ones. Example 1.39.  Borrow 1 hundred from the 6 hundreds. This leaves 5 hundreds. Convert the 1 hundred to 10 tens. Add 10 tens to 7 tens to get 17 tens. Practice Set C Perform the following subtractions. Show the expanded form for the first three problems. Exercise 1.6.9. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.10.

(Go to Solution) Borrowing More Than Once Sometimes it is necessary to borrow more than once. This is shown in the problems in the section called “Sample Set D”. Sample Set D Perform the Subtractions. Borrowing more than once if necessary Example 1.40.  Borrow 1 ten from the 4 tens. This leaves 3 tens. Convert the 1 ten to 10 ones. Add 10 ones to 1 one to get 11 ones. We can now perform 11 − 8. Borrow 1 hundred from the 6 hundreds. This leaves 5 hundreds. Convert the 1 hundred to 10 tens. Add 10 tens to 3 tens to get 13 tens. Now 13 − 5 = 8. 5 − 3 = 2. Example 1.41.  Borrow 1 ten from the 3 tens. This leaves 2 tens. Convert the 1 ten to 10 ones. Add 10 ones to 4 ones to get 14 ones. We can now perform 14 − 5. Borrow 1 hundred from the 5 hundreds. This leaves 4 hundreds. Convert the 1 hundred to 10 tens. Add 10 tens to 2 tens to get 12 tens. We can now perform 12 − 8 = 4. Finally, 4 − 0 = 4. Example 1.42.  After borrowing, we have Practice Set D Perform the following subtractions. Exercise 1.6.15. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.16. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.17. (Go to Solution)  || Borrowing from Zero It often happens in a subtraction problem that we have to borrow from one or more zeros. This occurs in problems such as and We'll examine each case. Example 1.43. Borrowing from a single zero. Consider the problem Since we do not have a name for 3 − 7, we must borrow from 0. Since there are no tens to borrow, we must borrow 1 hundred. One hundred = 10 tens. We can now borrow 1 ten from 10 tens (leaving 9 tens). One ten = 10 ones and 10 ones + 3 ones = 13 ones. Now we can suggest the following method for borrowing from a single zero. Borrowing from a Single Zero To borrow from a single zero, Decrease the digit to the immediate left of zero by one. Draw a line through the zero and make it a 10. Proceed to subtract as usual. Sample Set E Example 1.44.  Perform this subtraction. The number 503 contains a single zero The number to the immediate left of 0 is 5. Decrease 5 by 1. 5 − 1 = 4 Draw a line through the zero and make it a 10. Borrow from the 10 and proceed. 1 ten + 10 ones 10 ones + 3 ones = 13 ones Practice Set E Perform each subtraction. Exercise 1.6.18. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.19. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.20. (Go to Solution) Example 1.45. Borrowing from a group of zeros Consider the problem In this case, we have a group of zeros. Since we cannot borrow any tens or hundreds, we must borrow 1 thousand. One thousand = 10 hundreds. We can now borrow 1 hundred from 10 hundreds. One hundred = 10 tens. We can now borrow 1 ten from 10 tens. One ten = 10 ones. From observations made in this procedure we can suggest the following method for borrowing from a group of zeros. Borrowing from a Group of zeros To borrow from a group of zeros, Decrease the digit to the immediate left of the group of zeros by one. Draw a line through each zero in the group and make it a 9, except the rightmost zero, make it 10. Proceed to subtract as usual. Sample Set F Perform each subtraction. Example 1.46.  The number 40,000 contains a group of zeros. The number to the immediate left of the group is 4. Decrease 4 by 1. 4 − 1 = 3 Make each 0, except the rightmost one, 9. Make the rightmost 0 a 10. Subtract as usual. Example 1.47.  The number 8,000,006 contains a group of zeros. The number to the immediate left of the group is 8. Decrease 8 by 1. 8 − 1 = 7 Make each zero, except the rightmost one, 9. Make the rightmost 0 a 10. To perform the subtraction, we’ll need to borrow from the ten. Practice Set F Perform each subtraction. Exercise 1.6.21. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.22. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.23.
