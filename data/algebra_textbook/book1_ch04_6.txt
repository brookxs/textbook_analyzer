 || Multiplying a Polynomial by a Monomial Multiplying a polynomial by a monomial is a direct application of the distributive property. Distributive Property The distributive property suggests the following rule. Multiplying a Polynomial by a Monomial To multiply a polynomial by a monomial, multiply every term of the polynomial by the monomial and then add the resulting products together.  || Simplifying + (a + b) and – (a + b) + (a + b) and – (a + b)  Oftentimes, we will encounter multiplications of the form + 1(a + b) or – 1(a + b) These terms will actually appear as + (a + b) and – (a + b) Using the distributive property, we can remove the parentheses. The parentheses have been removed and the sign of each term has remained the same. The parentheses have been removed and the sign of each term has been changed to its opposite. To remove a set of parentheses preceded by a " + " sign, simply remove the parentheses and leave the sign of each term the same. To remove a set of parentheses preceded by a “ − ” sign, remove the parentheses and change the sign of each term to its opposite sign.  || Multiplying a Polynomial by a Polynomial Since we can consider an expression enclosed within parentheses as a single quantity, we have, by the distributive property, For convenience we will use the commutative property of addition to write this expression so that the first two terms contain a and the second two contain b . (a + b)(c + d) = a c + a d + b c + b d This method is commonly called the FOIL method. FFirst terms OOuter terms IInner terms LLast terms Rearranging, Combining like terms, = 5a + 5b This use of the distributive property suggests the following rule. Multiplying a Polynomial by a Polynomial To multiply two polynomials together, multiply every term of one polynomial by every term of the other polynomial.  ||
