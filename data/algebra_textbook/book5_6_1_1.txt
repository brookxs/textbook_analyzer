Finding the Greatest Common Factor of Monomials Example 4 reveals the technique used to find the greatest common factor of two or more monomials. Finding the GCF of two or more monomials. To find the greatest com- mon factor of two or more monomials, proceed as follows: 6.1. THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR 389 1. Find the greatest common factor (divisor) of the coefficients of the given monomials. Use prime factorization if necessary. 2. List each variable that appears in common in the given monomials. 3. Raise each variable that appears in common to the highest power that appears in common among the given monomials. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Find the greatest common factor of 6x3y3 and 9x2y5. Find the greatest common factor of 16xy3 and 12x4y2. Solution: To find the GCF of 6x3y3 and 9x2y5, we note that: 1. The greatest common factor (divisor) of 6 and 9 is 3. 2. The monomials 6x3y3 and 9x2y5 have the variables x and y in common. 3. The highest power of x in common is x2. The highest power of y in common is y3. Thus, the greatest common factor is GCF(6x3y3, 9x2y5) = 3x2y3. Note what happens when we write each of the given monomials as a product of the greatest common factor and a second monomial: 6x3y3 = 3x2y3 · 2x 9x2y5 = 3x2y3 · 3y Observe that the set of second monomial factors (2x and 3y) contain no addi- tional common factors.

Solution: To find the GCF of 12x4, 18x3, and 30x2, we note that: 1. The greatest common factor (divisor) of 12, 18, and 30 is 6. 2. The monomials 12x4, 18x3, and 30x2 have the variable x in common. 3. The highest power of x in common is x2. 390 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING Thus, the greatest common factor is GCF(12x4, 18x3, 30x2) = 6x2. Note what happens when we write each of the given monomials as a product of the greatest common factor and a second monomial: 12x4 = 6x2 · 2x2 18x3 = 6x2 · 3x 30x2 = 6x2 · 5 Observe that the set of second monomial factors (2x2, 3x, and 5) contain no additional common factors.Answer: 3y2 !
