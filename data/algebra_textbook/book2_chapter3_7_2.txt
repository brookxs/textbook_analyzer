Function Notation and Linear Functions With the definition of a function comes special notation. If we consider each x-value to be the input that produces exactly one output, then we can use the notation The notation f ( x ) reads “f of x” and should not be confused with multiplication. Most of our study of algebra involves functions, so the notation becomes very useful when performing common tasks. Functions can be named with different letters; some common names for functions are g(x), h(x), C(x), and R(x). First, consider nonvertical lines that we know can be expressed using slope-intercept form, y = m x + b . For any real numbers m and b, the equation defines a function, and we can replace y with the new notation f ( x ) as follows: Therefore, a linear function Any function that can be written in the form f(x) = mx + b. is any function that can be written in the form f ( x ) = m x + b . In particular, we can write the following: The notation also shows values to evaluate in the equation. If the value for x is given as 8, then we know that we can find the corresponding y-value by substituting 8 in for x and simplifying. Using function notation, this is denoted f ( 8 ) and can be interpreted as follows: Finally, simplify: We have f ( 8 ) = 4 . This notation tells us that when x = 8 (the input), the function results in 4 (the output).   Example 4: Given the linear function f ( x ) = − 5 x + 7 , find f ( − 2 ) . Solution: In this case, f ( − 2 ) indicates that we should evaluate when x = − 2 . Answer: f ( − 2 ) = 17   Example 5: Given the linear function f ( x ) = − 5 x + 7 , find x when f ( x ) = 10 . Solution: In this case, f ( x ) = 10 indicates that the function should be set equal to 10. Answer: Here x = − 3 5 , and we can write f ( − 3 5 ) = 10 .   Example 6: Given the graph of a linear function g ( x ) , a. Find g ( 2 ) . b. Find x when g ( x ) = 3 . Solution: a. The notation g ( 2 ) implies that x = 2. Use the graph to determine the corresponding y-value. Answer: g ( 2 ) = 1 b. The notation g ( x ) = 3 implies that the y-value is given as 3. Use the graph to determine the corresponding x-value. Answer: x = 4   Example 7: Graph the linear function f ( x ) = − 5 3 x + 6 and state the domain and range. Solution: From the function, we see that b = 6 and thus the y-intercept is (0, 6). Also, we can see that the slope is m = − 5 3 = − 5 3 = r i s e r u n . Starting from the y-intercept, mark a second point down 5 units and right 3 units. Given any coordinate on the x-axis, we can find a corresponding point on the graph; the domain consists of all real numbers. Also, for any coordinate on the y-axis, we can find a point on the graph; the range consists of all real numbers. Answer: Both the domain and range consist of all real numbers R.   Try this!

Answers: a. g ( − 1 2 ) = 11 2 b. x = − 13 Video Solution Function Notation and Linear Functions With the definition of a function comes special notation.
