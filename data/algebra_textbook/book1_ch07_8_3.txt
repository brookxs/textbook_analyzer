Method of Graphing The method of graphing linear inequalities in two variables is as follows: Graph the boundary line (consider the inequality as an equation, that is, replace the inequality sign with an equal sign). If the inequality is ≤ or ≥ , draw the boundary line solid. This means that points on the line are solutions and are part of the graph. If the inequality is < or > , draw the boundary line dotted. This means that points on the line are not solutions and are not part of the graph. Determine which half-plane to shade by choosing a test point. If, when substituted, the test point yields a true statement, shade the half-plane containing it. If, when substituted, the test point yields a false statement, shade the half-plane on the opposite side of the boundary line.
