Ratios and Rates Ratio A comparison, by division, of two pure numbers or two like denominate numbers is a ratio. The comparison by division of the pure numbers and the like denominate numbers are examples of ratios. Rate A comparison, by division, of two unlike denominate numbers is a rate. The comparison by division of two unlike denominate numbers, such as are examples of rates. Let's agree to represent two numbers (pure or denominate) with the letters a and b . This means that we're letting a represent some number and b represent some, perhaps different, number. With this agreement, we can write the ratio of the two numbers a and b as or The ratio is read as " a to b ." The ratio is read as " b to a ." Since a ratio or a rate can be expressed as a fraction, it may be reducible. Sample Set B Example 7.7.  The ratio 30 to 2 can be expressed as . Reducing, we get . The ratio 30 to 2 is equivalent to the ratio 15 to 1. Example 7.8.  The rate "4 televisions to 12 people" can be expressed as . The meaning of this rate is that "for every 4 televisions, there are 12 people." Reducing, we get . The meaning of this rate is that "for every 1 television, there are 3 people.” Thus, the rate of "4 televisions to 12 people" is the same as the rate of "1 television to 3 people."
