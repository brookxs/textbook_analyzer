The Pythagorean Theorem An angle that measures 90 degrees is called a right angle. If one of the angles of a triangle is a right angle, then the triangle is called a right triangle. It is traditional to mark the right angle with a little square (see Figure 8.8). A B Cb a c Figure 8.8: Right triangle &ABC has a right angle at vertex C. Right triangle terminology. • The longest side of the right triangle, the side directly opposite the right angle, is called the hypotenuse of the right triangle. • The remaining two sides of the right triangle are called the legs of the right triangle. 550 CHAPTER 8.
