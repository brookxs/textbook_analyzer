The Trial and Error Method of Factoring a x 2 + b x + c Trial and Error Method Consider the product Examining the trinomial 20 x 2 + 23 x + 6 , we can immediately see some factors of the first and last terms. Table 6.2. 20x 2 6 20x,  x 6,  1 10x,  2x 3,  2   5x,  4x   Our goal is to choose the proper combination of factors of the first and last terms that yield the middle term 23 x .Notice that the middle term comes from the sum of the outer and inner products in the multiplication of the two binomials. This fact provides us a way to find the proper combination. Look for the combination that when multiplied and then added yields the middle term.
