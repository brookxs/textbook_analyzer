Rational Equations Rational Equations When one rational expression is set equal to another rational expression, a rational equation results.Some examples of rational equations are the following (except for number 5): Example 8.93.  Example 8.94.  Example 8.95.  Example 8.96.  Example 8.97.  is a rational expression, not a rational equation.
