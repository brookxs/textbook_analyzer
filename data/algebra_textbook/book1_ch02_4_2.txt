The Closure Properties The Closure Properties If a and b are real numbers, then a + b is a unique real number, and a⋅b is a unique real number. For example, 3 and 11 are real numbers; 3 + 11 = 14 and 3⋅11 = 33, and both 14 and 33 are real numbers. Although this property seems obvious, some collections are not closed under certain operations. For example, Example 2.34.  The real numbers are not closed under division since, although 5 and 0 are real numbers, 5 / 0 and 0 / 0 are not real numbers. Example 2.35.  The natural numbers are not closed under subtraction since, although 8 is a natural number, 8 − 8 is not. ( 8 − 8 = 0 and 0 is not a natural number.)
