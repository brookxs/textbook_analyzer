Multiplication Multiplication is a description of repeated addition. In the addition of 5 + 5 + 5 the number 5 is repeated 3 times. Therefore, we say we have three times five and describe it by writing 3 × 5 Thus, 3 × 5 = 5 + 5 + 5 Multiplicand In a multiplication, the repeated addend (number being added) is called the multi­plicand. In 3 × 5, the 5 is the multiplicand. Multiplier Also, in a multiplication, the number that records the number of times the multiplicand is used is called the multiplier. In 3 × 5, the 3 is the multiplier. Sample Set A Express each repeated addition as a multiplication. In each case, specify the multiplier and the multiplicand. Example 2.1.  7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 6 × 7. Multiplier is 6. Multiplicand is 7. Example 2.2.  18 + 18 + 18 3 × 18. Multiplier is 3. Multiplicand is 18. Practice Set A Express each repeated addition as a multiplication. In each case, specify the multiplier and the multiplicand. Exercise 2.2.1. (Go to Solution) 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 __________. Multiplier is __________. Multiplicand is __________. Exercise 2.2.2. (Go to Solution) 36 + 36 + 36 + 36 + 36 + 36 + 36 + 36 __________. Multiplier is __________. Multiplicand is __________. Exercise 2.2.3. (Go to Solution) 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 __________. Multiplier is __________. Multiplicand is __________. Exercise 2.2.4. (Go to Solution) __________. Multiplier is __________. Multiplicand is __________. Factors In a multiplication, the numbers being multiplied are also called factors. Products The result of a multiplication is called the product. In 3 × 5 = 15, the 3 and 5 are not only called the multiplier and multiplicand, but they are also called factors. The product is 15. Indicators of Multiplication × ,⋅,( ) The multiplication symbol ( × ) is not the only symbol used to indicate multiplication. Other symbols include the dot ( ⋅ ) and pairs of parentheses ( ). The expressions 3 × 5, 3⋅5, 3(5), (3)5, (3)(5) all represent the same product. Multiplication Multiplication is a description of repeated addition.
