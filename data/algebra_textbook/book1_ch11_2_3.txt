Solution to A System of Equations Solution to a System We know that one of the infinitely many solutions to one linear equation in two variables is an ordered pair. An ordered pair that is a solution to both of the equations in a system is called a solution to the system of equations. For example, the ordered pair ( 3, 5 ) is a solution to the system since ( 3, 5 ) is a solution to both equations.
