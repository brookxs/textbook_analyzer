Multiplying by a Monomial Recall the product rule for exponents: if m and n are positive integers, then In other words, when multiplying two expressions with the same base, add the exponents. This rule applies when multiplying a monomial by a monomial. To find the product of monomials, multiply the coefficients and add the exponents of variable factors with the same base. For example, To multiply a polynomial by a monomial, apply the distributive property and then simplify each term.   Example 1: Multiply: − 5 x ( 4 x − 2 ) . Solution: In this case, multiply the monomial, − 5 x , by the binomial, 4 x − 2 . Apply the distributive property and then simplify. Answer: − 20 x 2 + 10 x   Example 2: Multiply: 2 x 2 ( 3 x 2 − 5 x + 1 ) . Solution: Apply the distributive property and then simplify. Answer: 6 x 4 − 10 x 3 + 2 x 2   Example 3: Multiply: − 3 a b 2 ( a 2 b 3 + 2 a 3 b − 6 a b − 4 ) . Solution: Answer: − 3 a 3 b 5 − 6 a 4 b 3 + 18 a 2 b 3 + 12 a b 2   To summarize, multiplying a polynomial by a monomial involves the distributive property and the product rule for exponents. Multiply all of the terms of the polynomial by the monomial. For each term, multiply the coefficients and add exponents of variables where the bases are the same.   Try this! Multiply: − 5 x 2 y ( 2 x y 2 − 3 x y + 6 x 2 y − 1 ) . Answer: − 10 x 3 y 3 + 15 x 3 y 2 − 30 x 4 y 2 + 5 x 2 y Video Solution Multiplying by a Monomial Recall the product rule for exponents: if m and n are positive integers, then In other words, when multiplying two expressions with the same base, add the exponents.
