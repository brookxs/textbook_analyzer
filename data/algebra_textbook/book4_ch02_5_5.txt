Division by 6, 8, 9, 10 Division by 6 A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. The number 234 is divisible by 2 since its last digit is 4. It is also divisible by 3 since 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 and 9 is divisible by 3. Therefore, 234 is divisible by 6. The number 6,532 is not divisible by 6. Although its last digit is 2, making it divisible by 2, the sum of its digits, 6 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 16, and 16 is not divisible by 3. Division by 8 A whole number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number that is divisible by 8. The number 4,000 is divisible by 8 since 000 is divisible by 8. The number 13,128 is divisible by 8 since 128 is divisible by 8. The number 1,170 is not divisible by 8 since 170 is not divisible by 8. Division by 9 A whole number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. The number 702 is divisible by 9 since 7 + 0 + 2 is divisible by 9. The number 6588 is divisible by 9 since 6 + 5 + 8 + 8 = 27 is divisible by 9. The number 14,123 is not divisible by 9 since 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 11 is not divisi­ble by 9. Division by 10 A Whole number is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0. Sample Set B Example 2.34.  The numbers 30, 170, 16,240, and 865,000 are all divisible by 10.
