Dividing Polynomial Functions We may use function notation to indicate division as follows: Division of functions: ( f / g ) ( x ) = f ( x ) g ( x ) The quotient of two polynomial functions does not necessarily have a domain of all real numbers. The values for x that make the function in the denominator 0 are restricted from the domain. This will be discussed in more detail at a later time. For now, assume all functions in the denominator are nonzero.   Example 9: Calculate: ( f / g ) ( x ) given f ( x ) = 6 x 5 − 36 x 4 + 12 x 3 − 6 x 2 and g ( x ) = − 6 x 2 . Solution: The notation indicates that we should divide: Answer: ( f / g ) ( x ) = − x 3 + 6 x 2 − 2 x + 1   Example 10: Calculate: ( f / g ) ( − 1 ) , given f ( x ) = − 3 x 3 + 7 x 2 − 11 x − 1 and g ( x ) = 3 x − 1 . Solution: First, determine ( f / g ) ( x ) . Therefore, Substitute −1 for the variable x . Answer: ( f / g ) ( − 1 ) = − 4 Dividing Polynomial Functions We may use function notation to indicate division as follows: Division of functions: ( f / g ) ( x ) = f ( x ) g ( x ) The quotient of two polynomial functions does not necessarily have a domain of all real numbers.
