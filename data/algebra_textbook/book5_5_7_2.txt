The Difference of Squares We can use the FOIL shortcut to multiply (a+ b)(a− b). 1. Multiply the terms in the “First” positions: a2 2. Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and add the results mentally: ab− ab = 0 3. Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions: −b2 Thus, (a + b)(a − b) = a2 − b2. Note how the right-hand side a2 − b2 is the difference of two squares. This leads to the following shortcut. The difference of squares. If you have identical terms in the “First” po- sitions and identical terms in the “Last” positions, but one set is separated with a plus sign while the other is separated by a minus sign, then proceed as follows: 1. Square the “First” term. 2. Square the “Last” term. 3. Place a minus sign between the results That is, (a+ b)(a− b) = a2 − b2 Note: If you don’t have identical terms in the “First” and “Last” positions, with one set separated with a plus sign and the other with a minus sign, then you do not have the difference of squares pattern and you must find some other way to multiply. For example, (x+3)(x− 3) is an example of the difference of squares pattern, but (2y + 3)(2y − 5) is not. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Use the difference of squares shortcut to simplify: (x+3)(x− Simplify: (x+ 5)(x− 5) 3) Solution: Note how the terms in the “First” position are identical, as are the terms in the “Last” position, with one set separated by a plus sign and the other with a minus sign. Hence, this is the difference of squares pattern and we proceed as follows: 1. Square the term in the “First” position: x2 2. Square the term in the “Last” position: (−3)2 = 9 3. Separate the squares with a minus sign. 374 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS That is: (x+ 3)(x− 3) = x2 − (3)2 = x2 − 9 Note: You should practice this pattern until you can go straight from the problem statement to the answer without writing down any intermediate work, as in (x+ 3)(x− 3) = x2 − 9.Answer: x2 − 25 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Use the difference of squares shortcut to simplify:Simplify: (3a− 6b)(3a+ 6b) (8y + 7z)(8y − 7z) Solution: Note how the terms in the “First” position are identical, as are the terms in the “Last” position, with one set separated by a plus sign and the other with a minus sign. Hence, this is the difference of squares pattern and we proceed as follows: 1. Square the term in the “First” position: (8y)2 = 64y2 2. Square the term in the “Last” position: (7z)2 = 49z2 3. Separate the squares with a minus sign. That is: (8y + 7z)(8y − 7z) = (8y)2 − (7z)2 = 64y2 − 49z2 Note: You should practice this pattern until you can go straight from the problem statement to the answer without writing down any intermediate work, as in (8y + 7z)(8y − 7z) = 64y2 − 49z2.Answer: 9a2 − 36b2 !
