Using the Calculator to Assist the ac-Method When using the ac-method to factor ax2+bx+c and ac is a very large number, then it can be difficult to find a pair whose product is ac and whose sum in b. For example, consider the trinomial: 12y2 − 11y − 36 We need an integer pair whose product is ac = −432 and whose sum is b = −11. We begin listing integer pair possibilities, but the process quickly becomes daunting. 1,− 432 2,− 216 · · · Note that the numbers in the second column are found by dividing ac = −432 by the number in the first column. We’ll now use this fact and the TABLE feature on our calculator to pursue the desired integer pair. 1. Enter the expression -432/X into Y1 in the Y= menu (see the first image in Figure 6.30). 2. Above the WINDOW button you’ll see TBLSET. Use the 2nd key, then press the WINDOW button to access the menu shown in the second image of Figure 6.30. Set TblStart=1, &Tbl=1, then highlight AUTO for both the independent and dependent variables. 3. Above the GRAPH button you’ll see TABLE. Use the 2nd key, then press the GRAPH button to access the table shown in the third image in Figure 6.30. Use the up- and down-arrow keys to scroll through the contents of the table. Note that you can ignore most of the pairs, be- cause they are not both integers. Pay attention only when they are both integers. In this case, remember that you are searching for a pair whose sum is b = −11. Note that the pair 16,−27 shown in the third image of Figure 6.30 is the pair we seek.

FACTORING STRATEGY 463 Now we can break the middle term of 12y2 − 11y − 36 into a sum of like terms using the ordered pair 16,−27, then factor by grouping. 12y2 − 11y − 36 = 12y2 + 16y − 27y − 36 = 4y(3y + 4)− 9(3y + 4) = (4y − 9)(3y + 4) Check: Use the FOIL method shortcut and mental calculations to multiply. (4y − 9)(3y + 4) = 12y2 − 11y − 36 The factorization checks. 464 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING ! ! !
