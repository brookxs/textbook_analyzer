Formulas Involving Radicals We next review the distance formula. Given two points and , The distance, d, between them is given by the following formula: Distance formula Given two points and calculate the distance d between them using the formula d = : Recall that this formula was derived from the Pythagorean theorem.   Example 9: Calculate the distance between (−4, 7) and (2, 1). Solution: Use the distance formula with the following points. It is a good practice to include the formula in its general form before substituting values for the variables; this improves readability and reduces the probability of making errors. Answer: units   Example 10: The period, T, of a pendulum in seconds is given by the formula where L represents the length of the pendulum in feet. If the length of a pendulum measures 6 feet, then calculate the period rounded off to the nearest tenth of a second. Solution: Substitute 6 for L and then simplify. Answer: The period is approximately 2.7 seconds. Formulas Involving Radicals We next review the distance formula.
