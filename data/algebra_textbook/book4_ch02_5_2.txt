Division by 2, 3, 4, and 5 Division by 2 A whole number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. The numbers 80, 112, 64, 326, and 1,008 are all divisible by 2 since the last digit of each is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, respectively. The numbers 85 and 731 are not divisible by 2. Division by 3 A whole number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The number 432 is divisible by 3 since 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 and 9 is divisible by 3. 432 ÷ 3 = 144 The number 25 is not divisible by 3 since 2 + 5 = 7, and 7 is not divisible by 3. Division by 4 A whole number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4. The number 31,048 is divisible by 4 since the last two digits, 4 and 8, form a number, 48, that is divisible by 4. 31048 ÷ 4 = 7262 The number 137 is not divisible by 4 since 37 is not divisible by 4. Division by 5 A whole number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. Sample Set A Example 2.33.  The numbers 65, 110, 8,030, and 16,955 are each divisible by 5 since the last digit of each is 0 or 5.
