The Double-Negative Property The number a is opposite − a on the number line. Therefore, − ( − a) is opposite − a on the number line. This means that − ( − a ) = a From this property of opposites, we can suggest the double-negative property for real numbers. Double-Negative Property: − ( − a) = a If a is a real number, then − ( − a ) = a Sample Set B Find the opposite of each number. Example 10.12.  If a = 2, then – a = – 2. Also, − ( − a) = − ( − 2) = 2. Example 10.13.  If a = – 4, then – a = – ( – 4) = 4. Also, – ( – a) = a = – 4. Practice Set B Find the opposite of each number. Exercise 10.3.7.
