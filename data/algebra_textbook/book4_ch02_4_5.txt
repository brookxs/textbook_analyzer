Division with a Multiple Digit Divisor The process of division also works when the divisor consists of two or more digits. We now make educated guesses using the first digit of the divisor and one or two digits of the dividend. Sample Set B Example 2.25.  Find 2,232÷36. Use the first digit of the divisor and the first two digits of the dividend to make the educated guess. 3 goes into 22 at most 7 times. Try 7: 7 × 36 = 252 which is greater than 223. Reduce the estimate. Try 6: 6 × 36 = 216 which is less than 223. Divide 3 into 7 to estimate the number of times 36 goes into 72. The 3 goes into 7 at most 2 times. Try 2: 2 × 36 = 72. Check: Thus, 2,232÷36 = 62. Example 2.26.  Find 2,417,228÷802. First, the educated guess: 24÷8 = 3. Then 3 × 802 = 2406, which is less than 2417. Use 3 as the guess. Since 3 × 802 = 2406, and 2406 has four digits, place the 3 above the fourth digit of the dividend. Subtract: 2417 - 2406 = 11. Bring down the 2. The divisor 802 goes into 112 at most 0 times. Use 0. The 8 goes into 11 at most 1 time, and 1 × 802 = 802, which is less than 1122. Try 1. Subtract 1122 – 802 = 320 Bring down the 8. 8 goes into 32 at most 4 times. 4 × 802 = 3208. Use 4. Check: Thus, 2,417,228÷802 = 3,014. Practice Set B Perform the following divisions. Exercise 2.4.6. (Go to Solution) 1,376÷32 Exercise 2.4.7. (Go to Solution) 6,160÷55 Exercise 2.4.8.
