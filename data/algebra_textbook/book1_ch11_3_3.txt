The Substitution Method The Substitution Method To solve a system of two linear equations in two variables, Solve one of the equations for one of the variables. Substitute the expression for the variable chosen in step 1 into the other equation. Solve the resulting equation in one variable. Substitute the value obtained in step 3 into the equation obtained in step 1 and solve to obtain the value of the other variable. Check the solution in both equations. Write the solution as an ordered pair. The Substitution Method The Substitution Method To solve a system of two linear equations in two variables, Solve one of the equations for one of the variables.
