SOLVING SYSTEMS BY GRAPHING 251 Solution: Let’s place each equation in slope-intercept form by solving each equation for y. Solve 2x+ 3y = 6 for y: 2x+ 3y = 6 2x+ 3y − 2x = 6− 2x 3y = 6− 2x 3y 3 = 6− 2x 3 y = −2 3 x+ 2 Solve 2x+ 3y = −6 for y: 2x+ 3y = −6 2x+ 3y − 2x = −6− 2x 3y = −6− 2x 3y 3 = −6− 2x 3 y = −2 3 x− 2 Comparing y = (−2/3)x+2 with the slope-intercept form y = mx+ b tells us that the slope is m = −2/3 and the y-intercept is (0, 2). Plot the intercept (0, 2), then go down 2 units and right 3 units and draw the line (see Figure 4.8). Comparing y = (−2/3)x − 2 with the slope-intercept form y = mx + b tells us that the slope is m = −2/3 and the y-intercept is (0,−2). Plot the intercept (0,−2), then go down 2 units and right 3 units and draw the line (see Figure 4.9). −5 5 −5 5 x y −2 3 (0, 2) 2x+ 3y = 6 Figure 4.8: Drawing the graph of the line 2x+ 3y = 6. −5 5 −5 5 x y −2 3 (0,−2) 2x+ 3y = −6 Figure 4.9: Drawing the graph of the line 2x+ 3y = −6. To find the solution of System 4.3, draw both lines on the same coordinate system (see Figure 4.10). Note how the lines appear to be parallel (they don’t intersect). The fact that both lines have the same slope −2/3 confirms our suspicion that the lines are parallel. However, note that the lines have differ- ent y-intercepts. Hence, we are looking at two parallel but distinct lines (see Figure 4.10) that do not intersect. Hence, System 4.3 has no solution. 252 CHAPTER 4.

Hence, the two lines are identical (see Figure 4.11). Hence, System 4.4 has an infinite number of points of intersection. Any point on either line is a solution of the system. Examples of points of intersection (solutions satisfying both equations) are (0,−3), (1,−2), and (3, 0). −5 5 −5 5 x y x− y = 3 −2x + 2y = −6 (0,−3) (1,−2) (3, 0) Figure 4.11: x − y = 3 and −2x+ 2y = −6 are the same line. 4.1.
