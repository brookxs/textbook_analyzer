Subtracting Polynomials Now that we know how to negate a polynomial (change the sign of each term of the polynomial), we’re ready to subtract polynomials. 5.4. ADDING AND SUBTRACTING POLYNOMIALS 337 You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify: Simplify: (4a2b+ 2ab− 7ab2)− (2a2b− ab− 5ab2)(y3 − 3y2z + 4yz2 + z3)− (2y3 − 8y2z + 2yz2 − 8z3) Solution: First, distribute the minus sign, changing the sign of each term of the second polynomial. (y3 − 3y2z + 4yz2 + z3)− (2y3 − 8y2z + 2yz2 − 8z3) = y3 − 3y2z + 4yz2 + z3 − 2y3 + 8y2z − 2yz2 + 8z3 Regroup, combining like terms. You may perform this next step mentally if you wish. = (y3 − 2y3) + (−3y2z + 8y2z) + (4yz2 − 2yz2) + (z3 + 8z3) = −y3 + 5y2z + 2yz2 + 9z3 Answer: 2a2b+ 3ab− 2ab2 ! Let’s subtract two polynomial functions. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Given p(x) = −5x3 + 6x − 9 and q(x) = 6x2 − 7x − 11, Given f(x) = 3x2 + 9x− 4 and g(x) = −5x2 + 4x− 6, simplify f(x)− g(x). simplify p(x) − q(x). Solution: First, replace p(x) and q(x) with their definitions. Because we are asked to subtract all of q(x) from all of p(x), it is critical to surround each polynomial with parentheses. p(x) − q(x) = (−5x3 + 6x− 9)− (6x2 − 7x− 11) Distribute the minus sign, changing the sign of each term in the second poly- nomial, then regroup and combine like terms. = −5x3 + 6x− 9− 6x2 + 7x+ 11 = −5x3 − 6x2 + (6x+ 7x) + (−9 + 11) = −5x3 − 6x2 + 13x+ 2 However, after distributing the minus sign, if we can combine like terms men- tally, eliminating the middle step, it is much more efficient to write: p(x)− q(x) = (−5x3 + 6x− 9)− (6x2 − 7x− 11) = −5x3 + 6x− 9− 6x2 + 7x+ 11 = −5x3 − 6x2 + 13x+ 2 Answer: 8x2 + 5x+ 2 ! 338 CHAPTER 5.
