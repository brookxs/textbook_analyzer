Solutions and Equivalent Equations Solutions and Solving an Equation The collection of values that make an equation true are called solutions of the equation. An equation is solved when all its solutions have been found. Equivalent Equations Some equations have precisely the same collection of solutions. Such equations are called equivalent equations. The equations are equivalent equations because the only value that makes each one true is 3.
