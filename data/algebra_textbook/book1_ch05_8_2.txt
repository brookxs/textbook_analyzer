Solutions to Linear Equations in Two Variables Solution to an Equation in Two Variables We have discovered that an equation is a mathematical way of expressing the relationship of equality between quantities. If the relationship is between two quantities, the equation will contain two variables. We say that an equation in two variables has a solution if an ordered pair of values can be found such that when these two values are substituted into the equation a true statement results. This is illustrated when we observe some solutions to the equation y = 2x + 5 . x = 4, y = 13;          since 13 = 2(4) + 5 is true . x = 1, y = 7;          since 7 = 2(1) + 5 is true . x = 0, y = 5;          since 5 = 2(0) + 5 is true . x = − 6, y = − 7;          since -7 = 2( − 6) + 5 is true .
