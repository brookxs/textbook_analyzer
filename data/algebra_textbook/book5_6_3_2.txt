Speeding Things Up a Bit Readers might again ask “Is it a coincidence that the circled pair 3,−12 seemed to ‘drop in place’ in the resulting factoriztion (x − 12)(x + 3) ?” The answer is “No,” it is not a coincidence. Provided the leading coefficient of the trinomial ax2 + bx+ c is a = 1, you can always “drop in place” the circled pair in order to arrive at the final factorization, skipping the factoring by grouping. Some readers might also be asking “Do I really have to list any of those ordered pairs if I already recognize the pair I need?” The answer is “No!” If you see the pair you need, drop it in place. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Factor: x2 − 5x− 24.Factor: x2 − 12x+ 35 Solution: Compare x2−5x−24 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 1, b = −5, and c = −24. Calculate ac = (1)(−24), so ac = −24. Now can you think of an integer pair whose product is ac = −24 and whose sum is b = −5? For some, the required pair just pops into their head: −8 and 3. The product of these 6.3. FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A = 1 417 two integers is −24 and their sum is −5.“Drop” this pair in place and you are done. x2 − 5x− 24 = (x− 8)(x+ 3) Use the FOIL shortcut to check your answer. F O I L (x− 8)(x+ 3) = x2 + 3x − 8x − 24 Combining like terms, (x − 8)(x + 3) = x2 − 5x − 24, the original trinomial. Our solution checks. Answer: (x − 7)(x− 5) ! The “Drop in Place” technique of Example 5 allows us to revise the ac- method a bit. Revised ac-method. Compare the given polynomial with the standard form ax2 + bx + c, determine the coefficients a, b, and c, then determine a pair of integers whose product equals ac and whose sum equals b. You then have two options: 1. Write the middle term as a product of like terms using the ordered pair whose product is ac and whose sum is b. Complete the factorization process by factoring by grouping. 2. (Only works if a = 1.) Simply “drop in place” the ordered pair whose product is ac and whose sum is b to complete the factorization process. Note: We’ll see in Factoring ax2 + bx+ c when a != 1 on page 427 why this “drop in place” choice does not work when a != 1. Readers are strongly encouraged to check their factorization by determining the product using the FOIL method. If this produces the original trinomial, the factorization is correct.
