The Fundamental Principle of Arithmetic Prime numbers are very useful in the study of mathematics. We will see how they are used in subsequent sections. We now state the Fundamental Principle of Arithmetic. Fundamental Principle of Arithmetic Except for the order of the factors, every natural number other than 1 can be factored in one and only one way as a product of prime numbers. Prime Factorization When a number is factored so that all its factors are prime numbers. the factori­zation is called the prime factorization of the number. The technique of prime factorization is illustrated in the following three examples. 10 = 5⋅2. Both 2 and 5 are primes. Therefore, 2⋅5 is the prime factorization of 10. 11. The number 11 is a prime number. Prime factorization applies only to composite numbers. Thus, 11 has no prime factorization. 60 = 2⋅30. The number 30 is not prime: 30 = 2⋅15. 60 = 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 15 The number 15 is not prime: 15 = 3⋅5 60 = 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 We'll use exponents. 60 = 2 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 The numbers 2, 3, and 5 are each prime. Therefore, 22⋅3⋅5 is the prime factorization of 60. The Fundamental Principle of Arithmetic Prime numbers are very useful in the study of mathematics.
