In this chapter, we will learn how to solve systems of linear equations by using a variety of methods, including Gaussian elimination. 245 246 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS  || 4.1 Solving Systems by Graphing In this section we introduce a graphical technique for solving systems of two linear equations in two unknowns. As we saw in the previous chapter, if a point satisfies an equation, then that point lies on the graph of the equation. If we are looking for a point that satisfies two equations, then we are looking for a point that lies on the graphs of both equations; that is, we are looking for a point of intersection. For example, consider the the two equations x− 3y = −9 2x+ 3y = 18, −2 8 −2 8 x y (3, 4) x− 3y = −9 2x+ 3y = 18 Figure 4.1: The point of in- tersection is a solution of the system of linear equations. which is called a system of linear equations. The equations are linear equations because their graphs are lines, as shown in Figure 4.1. Note that the two lines in Figure 4.1 intersect at the point (3, 4). Therefore, the point (3, 4) should satisfy both equations. Let’s check. Substitute 3 for x and 4 for y. x− 3y = −9 3− 3(4) = −9 3− 12 = −9 −9 = −9 Substitute 3 for x and 4 for y. 2x+ 3y = 18 2(3) + 3(4) = 18 6 + 12 = 18 18 = 18 Hence, the point (3, 4) satisfies both equations and is called a solution of the system. Solution of a linear system. A point (x, y) is called a solution of a system of two linear equations if and only if it satisfied both equations. Furthermore, because a point satisfies an equation if and only if it lies on the graph of the equation, to solve a system of linear equations graphically, we need to determine the point of intersection of the two lines having the given equations. Let’s try an example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: 2x− 5y = −10 y = x− 1 3x+ 2y = 12 y = x+ 1 (4.1) Solution: We are looking for the point (x, y) that satisfies both equations; that is, we are looking for the point that lies on the graph of both equations. Therefore, the logical approach is to plot the graphs of both lines, then identify the point of intersection. First, let’s determine the x- and y-intercepts of 3x+ 2y = 12. 4.1. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY GRAPHING 247 To find the x-intercept, let y = 0. 3x+ 2y = 12 3x+ 2(0) = 12 3x = 12 x = 4 To find the y-intercept, let x = 0. 3x+ 2y = 12 3(0) + 2y = 12 2y = 12 y = 6 Hence, the x-intercept is (4, 0) and the y-intercept is (0, 6). These intercepts are plotted in Figure 4.2 and the line 3x+ 2y = 12 is drawn through them. Comparing the second equation y = x + 1 with the slope-intercept form y = mx + b, we see that the slope is m = 1 and the y-intercept is (0, 1). Plot the intercept (0, 1), then go up 1 unit and right 1 unit, then draw the line (see Figure 4.3). −2 8 −2 8 x y (4, 0) (0, 6) 3x+ 2y = 12 Figure 4.2: Drawing the graph of 3x+ 2y = 12. −2 8 −2 8 x y 1 1 (0, 1) y = x+ 1 Figure 4.3: Drawing the graph of y = x+ 1. We are trying to find the point that lies on both lines, so we plot both lines on the same coordinate system, labeling each with its equation (see Figure 4.4). It appears that the lines intersect at the point (2, 3), making (x, y) = (2, 3) the solution of System 4.1 (see Figure 4.4). Check: To show that (x, y) = (2, 3) is a solution of System 4.1, we must show that we get true statements when we substitute 2 for x and 3 for y in both equations of System 4.1. 248 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS −2 8 −2 8 x y (2, 3) y = x+ 1 3x+ 2y = 12 Figure 4.4: The coordinates of the point of intersection is the solution of System 4.1. Substituting 2 for x and 3 for y in 3x+ 2y = 12, we get: 3x+ 2y = 12 3(2) + 2(3) = 12 6 + 6 = 12 12 = 12 Hence, (2, 3) satisfies the equation 3x+ 2y = 12. Substituting 2 for x and 3 for y in y = x+ 1, we get: y = x+ 1 3 = 2 + 1 3 = 3 Hence, (2, 3) satisfies the equation y = x+ 1. Because (2, 3) satisfies both equations, this makes (2, 3) a solution of System 4.1. Answer: (5, 4) ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: −4x− 3y = 12 x− 2y = −2 3x− 5y = −15 2x+ y = −4 (4.2) Solution: Once again, we are looking for the point that satisfies both equations of the System 4.2. Thus, we need to find the point that lies on the graphs of both lines represented by the equations of System 4.2. The approach will be to graph both lines, then approximate the coordinates of the point of intersection. First, let’s determine the x- and y-intercepts of 3x− 5y = −15. 4.1. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY GRAPHING 249 To find the x-intercept, let y = 0. 3x− 5y = −15 3x− 5(0) = −15 3x = −15 x = −5 To find the y-intercept, let x = 0. 3x− 5y = −15 3(0)− 5y = −15 −5y = −15 y = 3 Hence, the x-intercept is (−5, 0) and the y-intercept is (0, 3). These intercepts are plotted in Figure 4.5 and the line 3x− 5y = −15 is drawn through them. Next, let’s determine the intercepts of the second equation 2x+ y = −4. To find the x-intercept, let y = 0. 2x+ y = −4 2x+ 0 = −4 2x = −4 x = −2 To find the y-intercept, let x = 0. 2x+ y = −4 2(0) + y = −4 y = −4 Hence, the x-intercept is (−2, 0) and the y-intercept is (0,−4). These intercepts Later in this section we will learn how to use the intersect utility on the graphing calculator to obtain a much more accurate approximation of the actual solution. Then, in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, we’ll show how to find the exact solution. are plotted in Figure 4.6 and the line 2x+ y = −4 is drawn through them. −10 10 −10 10 x y (−5, 0) (0, 3) 3x− 5y = −15 Figure 4.5: Drawing the graph of the line 3x− 5y = −15. −10 10 −10 10 x y (−2, 0) (0,−4) 2x+ y = −4 Figure 4.6: Drawing the graph of the line 2x+ y = −4. To find the solution of System 4.2, we need to plot both lines on the same coordinate system and determine the coordinates of the point of intersection. Unlike Example 1, in this case we’ll have to be content with an approximation of these coordinates. It appears that the coordinates of the point of intersection are approximately (−2.6, 1.4) (see Figure 4.7). Check: Because we only have an approximation of the solution of the system, we cannot expect the solution to check exactly in each equation. However, we do hope that the solution checks approximately. 250 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS −10 10 −10 10 x y (−2.6, 1.4) 3x− 5y = −15 2x+ y = −4 Figure 4.7: The approximate coordinates of the point of intersection are (−2.6, 1.4). Substitute (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) into the first equation of System 4.2. 3x− 5y = −15 3(−2.6)− 5(1.4) = −15 −7.8− 7 = −15 −14.8 = −15 Note that (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) does not check exactly, but it is pretty close to being a true statement. Substitute (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) into the second equation of System 4.2. 2x+ y = −4 2(−2.6) + 1.4 = −4 −5.2 + 1.4 = −4 −3.8 = −4 Again, note that (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) does not check ex- actly, but it is pretty close to being a true statement. Because (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) very nearly makes both equations a true state- ment, it seems that (x, y) = (−2.6, 1.4) is a reasonable approximation for the solution of System 4.2.Approximate answer: (−2.7,−0.4) !  || Exceptional Cases Most of the time, given the graphs of two lines, they will intersect in exactly one point. But there are two exceptions to this general scenario. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: x− y = 3 −2x+ 2y = 4 2x+ 3y = 6 2x+ 3y = −6 (4.3) 4.1. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY GRAPHING 251 Solution: Let’s place each equation in slope-intercept form by solving each equation for y. Solve 2x+ 3y = 6 for y: 2x+ 3y = 6 2x+ 3y − 2x = 6− 2x 3y = 6− 2x 3y 3 = 6− 2x 3 y = −2 3 x+ 2 Solve 2x+ 3y = −6 for y: 2x+ 3y = −6 2x+ 3y − 2x = −6− 2x 3y = −6− 2x 3y 3 = −6− 2x 3 y = −2 3 x− 2 Comparing y = (−2/3)x+2 with the slope-intercept form y = mx+ b tells us that the slope is m = −2/3 and the y-intercept is (0, 2). Plot the intercept (0, 2), then go down 2 units and right 3 units and draw the line (see Figure 4.8). Comparing y = (−2/3)x − 2 with the slope-intercept form y = mx + b tells us that the slope is m = −2/3 and the y-intercept is (0,−2). Plot the intercept (0,−2), then go down 2 units and right 3 units and draw the line (see Figure 4.9). −5 5 −5 5 x y −2 3 (0, 2) 2x+ 3y = 6 Figure 4.8: Drawing the graph of the line 2x+ 3y = 6. −5 5 −5 5 x y −2 3 (0,−2) 2x+ 3y = −6 Figure 4.9: Drawing the graph of the line 2x+ 3y = −6. To find the solution of System 4.3, draw both lines on the same coordinate system (see Figure 4.10). Note how the lines appear to be parallel (they don’t intersect). The fact that both lines have the same slope −2/3 confirms our suspicion that the lines are parallel. However, note that the lines have differ- ent y-intercepts. Hence, we are looking at two parallel but distinct lines (see Figure 4.10) that do not intersect. Hence, System 4.3 has no solution. 252 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS −5 5 −5 5 x y 2x+ 3y = 6 2x+ 3y = −6 Figure 4.10: The lines 2x+3y = 6 and 2x+3y = −6 are parallel, distinct lines. Answer: No solution. ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: −6x+ 3y = −12 2x− y = 4 x− y = 3 −2x+ 2y = −6 (4.4) Solution: Let’s solve both equations for y. Solve x− y = 3 for y: x− y = 3 x− y − x = 3− x −y = −x+ 3 −1(−y) = −1(−x+ 3) y = x− 3 Solve −2x+ 2y = −6 for y: −2x+ 2y = −6 −2x+ 2y + 2x = −6 + 2x 2y = 2x− 6 2y 2 = 2x− 6 2 y = x− 3 Both lines have slope m = 1, and both have the same y-intercept (0,−3). Hence, the two lines are identical (see Figure 4.11). Hence, System 4.4 has an infinite number of points of intersection. Any point on either line is a solution of the system. Examples of points of intersection (solutions satisfying both equations) are (0,−3), (1,−2), and (3, 0). −5 5 −5 5 x y x− y = 3 −2x + 2y = −6 (0,−3) (1,−2) (3, 0) Figure 4.11: x − y = 3 and −2x+ 2y = −6 are the same line. 4.1. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY GRAPHING 253 Alternate solution: A much easier approach is to note that if we divide both sides of the second equation −2x+ 2y = −6 by −2, we get: −2x+ 2y = −6 Second equation in System 4.4. −2x+ 2y −2 = −6 −2 Divide both sides by −2. −2x −2 + 2y −2 = −6 −2 Distribute −2. x− y = 3 Simplify. Hence, the second equation in System 4.4 is identical to the first. Thus, there Answer: There are an infinite number of solutions. The lines are identical, so any point on either line is a solution.are an infinite number of solutions. Any point on either line is a solution. ! Examples 1, 2, 3, and 4 lead us to the following conclusion. Number of solutions of a linear system. When dealing with a system of two linear equations in two unknowns, there are only three possibilities: 1. There is exactly one solution. 2. There are no solutions. 3. There are an infinite number of solutions.  || Solving Systems with the Graphing Calculator We’ve already had experience graphing equations with the graphing calculator. We’ve also used the TRACE button to estimate points of intersection. How- ever, the graphing calculator has a much more sophisticated tool for finding points of intersection. In the next example we’ll use the graphing calculator to find the solution of System 4.1 of Example 1. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Use the graphing calculator to solve the following system of Solve the following system of equations: 2x− 5y = 9 y = 2x− 5 equations: 3x+ 2y = 12 y = x+ 1 (4.5) Solution: To enter an equation in the Y= menu, the equation must first be 254 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS solved for y. Hence, we must first solve 3x+ 2y = 12 for y. 3x+ 2y = 12 Original equation. 2y = 12− 3x Subtract 3x from both sides of the equation. 2y 2 = 12− 3x 2 Divide both sides by 2. y = 12 2 − 3x 2 On the left, simplify. On the right, distribute division by 2. y = 6− 3 2 x Simplify. We can now substitute both equations of System 4.5 into the Y= menu (see Figure 4.12). Select 6:ZStandard from the ZOOM menu to produce the graphs shown in Figure 4.13. Figure 4.12: Enter System 4.5 equations into the Y= menu. Figure 4.13: Select 6:ZStandard to produce the graphs of the sys- tem (4.5) equations. The question now becomes “How do we calculate the coordinates of the point of intersection?” Look on your calculator case just above the TRACE button on the top row of buttons, where you’ll see the word CAlC, painted in the same color as the 2ND key. Press the 2ND key, then the TRACE button, which will open the CALCULATE menu shown in Figure 4.14. Select 5:intersect. The result is shown in Figure 4.15. The calculator has placed the cursor on the curve y = 6 − (3/2)x (see upper left corner of your viewing screen), and in the lower left corner the calculator is asking you if you want to use the selected curve as the “First curve.” Answer “yes” by pressing the ENTER button. Having the calculator ask “First curve,” “Second curve,” when there are only two curves on the screen may seem annoying. However, imagine the situation when there are three or more curves on the screen. Then these questions make good sense. You can change your selection of “First curve” or “Second curve” by using the up-and-down arrow keys to move the cursor to a different curve. The calculator responds as shown Figure 4.16. The cursor jumps to the curve y = x + 1 (see upper left corner of your viewing window), and in the lower left corner the calculator is asking you if you want to use the selected curve as the “Second curve.” Answer “yes” by pressing the ENTER key again. The calculator responds as shown Figure 4.17, asking you to “Guess.” In this case, leave the cursor where it is and press the ENTER key again to signal the calculator that you are making a guess at the current position of the cursor. The result of pressing ENTER to the “Guess” question in Figure 4.17 is shown in Figure 4.18, where the calculator now provides an approximation 4.1.

Approximate answer: (−4.2,−0.4) ! 4.1. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY GRAPHING 259 ! ! !  || 4.2 Solving Systems by Substitution In this section we introduce an algebraic technique for solving systems of two equations in two unknowns called the substitution method. The substitution method is fairly straightforward to use. First, you solve either equation for either variable, then substitute the result into the other equation. The result is an equation in a single variable. Solve that equation, then substitute the result into any of the other equations to find the remaining unknown variable. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: 9x+ 2y = −19 y = 13 + 3x 2x− 5y = −8 (4.7) y = 3x− 1 (4.8) Solution: Equation (4.8) is already solved for y. Substitute equation (4.8) into equation (4.7). This means we will substitute 3x−1 for y in equation (4.7). 2x− 5y = −8 Equation (4.7). 2x− 5(3x− 1) = −8 Substitute 3x− 1 for y in (4.7). Now solve for x. 2x− 15x+ 5 = −8 Distribute −5. −13x+ 5 = −8 Simplify. −13x = −13 Subtract 5 from both sides. x = 1 Divide both sides by −13. As we saw in Solving Systems by Graphing, the solution to the system is the point of intersection of the two lines represented by the equations in the system. This means that we can substitute the answer x = 1 into either equation to find the corresponding value of y. We choose to substitute 1 for x in equation (4.8), then solve for y, but you will get exactly the same result if you substitute 1 for x in equation (4.7). −5 5 −5 5 x y 2x− 5y = −8 y = 3x− 1 (1, 2) Figure 4.27: 2x − 5y = −8 and y = x − 3 intersect at (1, 2). y = 3x− 1 Equation (4.8). y = 3(1)− 1 Substitute 1 for x. y = 2 Simplify. Hence, (x, y) = (1, 2) is the solution of the system. Check: To show that the solution (x, y) = (1, 2) is a solution of the system, we need to show that (x, y) = (1, 2) satisfies both equations (4.7) and (4.8). 4.2. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY SUBSTITUTION 263 Substitute (x, y) = (1, 2) in equa- tion (4.7): 2x− 5y = −8 2(1)− 5(2) = −8 2− 10 = −8 −8 = −8 Thus, (1, 2) satisfies equation (4.7). Substitute (x, y) = (1, 2) in equa- tion (4.8): y = 3x− 1 2 = 3(1)− 1 2 = 3− 1 2 = 2 Thus, (1, 2) satisfies equation (4.8). Because (x, y) = (1, 2) satisfies both equations, it is a solution of the system. Answer: (−3, 4) ! Substitution method. The substitution method involves these steps: 1. Solve either equation for either variable. 2. Substitute the result from step one into the other equation. Solve the resulting equation. 3. Substitute the result from step two into either of the original system equa- tions or the resulting equation from step one (whichever seems easiest), then solve to find the remaining unknown variable. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Solve the following system of equations: Solve the following system of equations: x− 2y = 13 4x− 3y = 26 5x− 2y = 12 (4.9) 4x+ y = 6 (4.10) Solution: The first step is to solve either equation for either variable. This means that we can solve the first equation for x or y, but it also means that we could first solve the second equation for x or y. Of these four possible choices, solving the second equation (4.10) for y seems the easiest way to start. 4x+ y = 6 Equation (4.10). y = 6− 4x Subtract 4x from both sides. 264 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS Next, substitute 6− 4x for y in equation (4.9). 5x− 2y = 12 Equation (4.9). 5x− 2(6− 4x) = 12 Substitute 6− 4x for y in (4.9). 5x− 12 + 8x = 12 Distribute −2. 13x− 12 = 12 Simplify. 13x = 24 Add 12 to both sides. x = 24 13 Divide both sides by 13. Finally, to find the y-value, substitute 24/13 for x in the equation y = 6 − 4x (you can also substitute 24/13 for x in equations (4.9) or (4.10)). y = 6− 4x y = 6− 4 ( 24 13 ) Substitute 24/13 for x in y = 6− 4x. y = 78 13 − 96 13 Multiply, then make equivalent fractions. y = −18 13 Simplify.

SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS Substitute −3 + 32x for y in equation (4.12). 4x+ 5y = 20 Equation (4.12). 4x+ 5 ( −3 + 3 2 x ) = 20 Substitute −3 + 3 2 x for y. 4x− 15 + 15 2 x = 20 Distribute the 5. 8x− 30 + 15x = 40 Clear fractions by multiplying both sides by 2. 23x = 70 Simplify. Add 30 to both sides. x = 70 23 Divide both sides by 23. To find y, substitute 70/23 for x into equation y = −3 + 32x. You could also substitute 70/23 for x in equations (4.11) or (4.12) and get the same result. −5 5 −5 5 x y 3x− 2y = 6 4x + 5y = 20 (70/23, 36/23) Figure 4.31: 3x − 2y = 6 and 4x+ 5y = 20 intersect at (70/23, 36/23). y = −3 + 3 2 x y = −3 + 3 2 ( 70 23 ) Substitute 70/23 for x. y = −69 23 + 105 23 Multiply.

Check: To check this solution, let’s use the graphing calculator to find the solution of the system. We already know that 3x − 2y = 6 is equivalent to y = −3 + 32x. Let’s also solve equation (4.12) for y. 4x+ 5y = 20 Equation (4.12). 5y = 20− 4x Subtract 4x from both sides. y = 20− 4x 5 Divide both sides by 5. y = 4− 4 5 x Divide both 20 and −4x by 5 using the distributive property.

SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS  || Exceptional Cases Revisited It is entirely possible that you might apply the substitution method to a system of equations that either have an infinite number of solutions or no solutions at all. Let’s see what happens should you do that. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: x = 4 3 y − 7 6x− 8y = −3 2x+ 3y = 6 (4.13) y = −2 3 x+ 4 (4.14) Solution: Equation (4.14) is already solved for y, so let’s substitute − 23x+ 4 for y in equation (4.13). 2x+ 3y = 6 Equation (4.13). 2x+ 3 ( −2 3 x+ 4 ) = 6 Substitute −2 3 x+ 4 for y. 2x− 2x+ 12 = 6 Distribute the 3. 12 = 6 Simplify. Goodness! What happened to the x? How are we supposed to solve for x in this situation? However, note that the resulting statement, 12 = 6, is false, no matter what we use for x and y. This should give us a clue that there are no solutions. Perhaps we are dealing with parallel lines? Let’s solve equation (4.13) for y, putting the equation into slope-intercept form, to help determine the situation. 2x+ 3y = 6 Equation (4.13). 3y = −2x+ 6 Subtract 2x from both sides. y = −2 3 x+ 2 Divide both sides by 3. Thus, our system is equivalent to the following two equations. −5 5 −5 5 x y 2x + 3y = 6 y = − 2 3 x + 4 Figure 4.36: 2x+ 3y = 6 and y = − 23x+ 4 are parallel. No solution. y = − 2 3 x+ 2 (4.15) y = −2 3 x+ 4 (4.16) These lines have the same slope −2/3, but different y-intercepts (one has y- intercept (0, 2), the other has y-intercept (0, 4)). Hence, these are two distinct parallel lines and the system has no solution.Answer: no solution ! 4.2. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY SUBSTITUTION 269 You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Solve the following system of equations: Solve the following system of equations: −28x+ 14y = −126 y = 2x− 9 2x− 6y = −8 (4.17) x = 3y − 4 (4.18) Solution: Equation (4.18) is already solved for x, so let’s substitute 3y−4 for x in equation (4.17). 2x− 6y = −8 Equation (4.17). 2(3y − 4)− 6y = −8 Substitute 3y − 4 for x. 6y − 8− 6y = −8 Distribute the 2. −8 = −8 Simplify. Goodness! What happened to the x? How are we supposed to solve for x in this situation? However, note that the resulting statement, −8 = −8, is a true statement this time. Perhaps this is an indication that we are dealing with the same line? Let’s put both equations (4.17) and (4.18) into slope-intercept form so that we can compare them. −5 5 −5 5 x y x = 3y − 4 2x− 6y = −8 (−4, 0) (−1, 1) (2, 2) Figure 4.37: 2x − 6y = −8 and x = 3y − 4 are the same line.

Thus, there are an infinite number of solutions. Indeed, any point on either line is a solution. Examples of solution points are (−4, 0), (−1, 1), and (2, 2). Answer: There are an infinite number of solutions. Examples of solution points are (0,−9), (5, 1), and (−3,−15). ! Tip. When you substitute one equation into another and the variable disap- pears, consider: 1. If the resulting statement is false, then you have two distinct parallel lines and there is no solution. 2. If the resulting statement is true, then you have the same lines and there are an infinite number of solutions. 270 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS ! ! !  || 4.3 Solving Systems by Elimination When both equations of a system are in standard form Ax + By = C, then a process called elimination is usually the best procedure to use to find the solution of the system. Elimination is based on two simple ideas, the first of which should be familiar. 1. Multiplying both sides of an equation by a non-zero number does not change its solutions. Thus, the equation x+ 3y = 7 (4.19) will have the same solutions (it’s the same line) as the equation obtained by multiplying equation (4.19) by 2. 2x+ 6y = 14 (4.20) 2. Adding two true equations produces another true equation. For example, consider what happens when you add 4 = 4 to 5 = 5. 4 = 4 5 = 5 9 = 9 Even more importantly, consider what happens when you add two equa- tions that have (2, 1) as a solution. The result is a third equation whose graph also passes through the solution. x + y = 3 x − y = 1 2x = 4 x = 2 −5 5 −5 5 x y x = 2x− y = 1 x+ y = 3 Fact. Adding a multiple of an equation to a second equation produces an equation that passes through the same solution as the first two equations. 274 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS One more important thing to notice is the fact that when we added the equations x + y = 3 x − y = 1 2x = 4 the variable y was eliminated. This is where the elimination method gets its name. The strategy is to somehow add the equations of a system with the intent of eliminating one of the unknown variables. However, sometimes you need to do a little bit more than simply add the equations. Let’s look at an example. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve the following system of equations.Solve the following system of equations: x+ 3y = 14 −8x− 3y = −28 x+ 2y = −5 (4.21) 2x− y = −5 (4.22) Solution: Our focus will be on eliminating the variable x. Note that if we multiply equation (4.21) by −2, then add the result to equation (4.22), the x terms will be eliminated. −2x − 4y = 10 Multiply equation (4.21) by −2. 2x − y = −5 Equation (4.22). − 5y = 5 Add the equations. Divide both sides of −5y = 5 by −5 to get y = −1. To find the corresponding value of x, substitute −1 for y in equation (4.21) (or equation (4.22)) and solve for x. x+ 2y = −5 Equation (4.21) x+ 2(−1) = −5 Substitute −1 for y. x = −3 Solve for x. −5 5 −5 5 x y x + 2y = −5 2x− y = −5 (−3,−1) Figure 4.38: x + 2y = −5 and 2x − y = −5 intersect at (−3,−1). Check: To check, we need to show that the point (x, y) = (−3, 1) satisfies both equations. Substitute (x, y) = (−3,−1) into equation (4.21). x+ 2y = −5 −3 + 2(−1) = −5 −5 = −5 Substitute (x, y) = (−3,−1) into equation (4.22). 2x− y = −5 2(−3)− (−1) = −5 −5 = −5 Thus, the point (x, y) = (−3,−1) satisfies both equations and is therefore the solution of the system.Answer: (2, 4). ! 4.3. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY ELIMINATION 275 To show that you have the option of which variable you choose to eliminate, let’s try Example 1 a second time, this time eliminating y instead of x. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Solve the following system of equations. x+ 2y = −5 (4.23) 2x− y = −5 (4.24) Solution: This time we focus on eliminating the variable y. We note that if we multiply equation (4.24) by 2, then add the result to equation (4.23), the y terms will be eliminated. −5 5 −5 5 x y x + 2y = −5 2x− y = −5 (−3,−1) Figure 4.39: x + 2y = −5 and 2x− y = −5 intersect at (−3,−1). x + 2y = −5 Equation (4.23). 4x − 2y = −10 Multiply equation (4.24) by 2. 5x = −15 Add the equations. Divide both sides of 5x = −15 by 5 to get x = −3. To find the corresponding value of y, substitute −3 for x in equation (4.23) (or equation (4.24)) and solve for y. x+ 2y = −5 Equation (4.23) −3 + 2y = −5 Substitute −3 for x. 2y = −2 Add 3 to both sides. y = −1 Divide both sides by 2. Hence, (x, y) = (−3,−1), just as in Example 1, is the solution of the system. ! Sometimes elimination requires a thought process similar to that of finding a common denominator. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Solve the following system of equations. Solve the following system of equations: −14x+ 9y = 94 7x+ 3y = −62 3x+ 4y = 12 (4.25) 2x− 5y = 10 (4.26) Solution: Let’s focus on eliminating the x-terms. Note that if we multiply equation (4.25) by 2, then multiply equation (4.26) by −3, the x-terms will be eliminated when we add the resulting equations. 6x + 8y = 24 Multiply equation (4.25) by 2. −6x + 15y = −30 Multiply equation (4.26) by −3. 23y = −6 Add the equations. 276 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS Hence, y = −6/23. At this point, we could substitute y = −6/23 in either equation, then solve the result for x. However, working with y = −6/23 is a bit daunting, partic- ularly in the light of elimination being easier. So let’s use elimination again, this time focusing on eliminating y. Note that if we multiply equation (4.25) by 5, then multiply equation (4.26) by 4, when we add the results, the y-terms will be eliminated. 15x + 20y = 60 Multiply equation (4.25) by 5. 8x − 20y = 40 Multiply equation (4.26) by 4. 23x = 100 Add the equations. Thus, x = 100/23, and the system of the system is (x, y) = (100/23,−6/23). −2 8 −5 5 x y 3x + 4y = 122x− 5y = 10 (100/23,−6/23) Figure 4.40: 3x + 4y = 12 and 2x− 5y = 10 intersect at (100/23,−6/23). Check: Let’s use the graphing calculator to check the solution. First, store 100/23 in X, then −6/23 in Y (see Figure 4.41). Next, enter the left-hand sides of equations (4.25) and (4.26). Figure 4.41: Enter 100/23 in X, −6/23 in Y. Figure 4.42: Enter the left-hand sides of equations (4.25) and (4.26). Note that both calculations in Figure 4.42 provide the correct right-hand sides for equations (4.25) and (4.26). Thus, the solution (x, y) = (100/23,−6/23) checks.Answer: (−8,−2). !  || Exceptional Cases In the previous section, we saw that if the substitution method led to a false statement, then we have parallel lines. The same thing can happen with the elimination method of this section. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve the following system of equations.Solve the following system of equations: 5x− 4y = −16 15x− 12y = 49 x+ y = 3 (4.27) 2x+ 2y = −6 (4.28) 4.3. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY ELIMINATION 277 Solution: Let’s focus on eliminating the x-terms. Note that if we multiply equation (4.27) by−2, the x-terms will be eliminated when we add the resulting equations. −2x − 2y = −6 Multiply equation (4.27) by −2. 2x + 2y = −6 Equation (4.28). 0 = −12 Add the equations. Because of our experience with this solving this exceptional case with substi- tution, the fact that both variables have disappeared should not be completely surprising. Note that this last statement is false, regardless of the values of x and y. Hence, the system has no solution. Indeed, if we find the intercepts of each equation and plot them, then we can easily see that the lines of this system are parallel (see Figure 4.43). Parallel lines never intersect, so the system has no solutions. −5 5 −5 5 x y (3, 0) (0, 3) (−3, 0) (0,−3) x+ y = 3 2x+ 2y = −6 Figure 4.43: The lines x+ y = 3 and 2x+ 2y = −6 are parallel.

SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS Solution: If we are not on automatic pilot late at night doing our homework, we might recognize that the equations 4.29 and (4.30) are identical. But it’s also conceivable that we don’t see that right away and begin the elimination method. Let’s multiply the first equation by 3, then add. This will eliminate the x-terms. 3x − 21y = 12 Multiply equation (4.29) by 3. −3x + 21y = −12 Equation (4.30). 0 = 0 Add the equations. Again, all of the variables have disappeared! However, this time the last state- ment is true, regardless of the values of x and y. −5 5 x y −3x + 21y = −12 x− 7y = 4 (−3,−1) (0,−4/7) (4, 0) Figure 4.44: x − 7y = 4 and −3x + 21y = −12 are the same line. Infinite number of solutions. Notice that if we multiply equation (4.29) by −3, then we have two identical equations. −3x + 21y = −12 Multiply equation (4.29) by 3. −3x + 21y = −12 Equation (4.30). The equations are identical! Hence, there are an infinite number of points of intersection. Indeed, any point on either line is a solution. Example points of solution are (−3,−1), (0,−4/7), and (4, 0). Answer: There are an infinite number of solutions. Examples of solution points are (2, 0), (9, 2), and (−5,−2). ! 4.3.

Our variable dictionary will take the form of a diagram, naming the two complementary angles α and β. α β 2. Set up a Systems of Equations. The “second angle is 30 degrees larger than twice the first angle” becomes β = 30 + 2α (4.31) Secondly, the angles are complementary, meaning that the sum of the angles is 90◦. α + β = 90 (4.32) Thus, we have a system of two equations in two unknowns α and β. 3. Solve the System. As equation (4.31) is already solved for β, let use the substitution method and substitute 30 + 2α for β in equation (4.32). α + β = 90 Equation (4.32). α + (30 + 2α) = 90 Substitute 30 + 2α for β. 3α + 30 = 90 Combine like terms. 3α = 60 Subtract 30 from both sides. α = 20 Divide both sides by 3. 4.4. APPLICATIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEMS 283 4. Answer the Question. The first angle is α = 20 degrees. The second angle is: β = 30 + 2α Equation (4.31). β = 30 + 2(20) Substitute 20 for α. β = 70 Simplify. 5. Look Back. Certainly 70◦ is 30◦ larger than twice 20◦. Also, note that 20◦ + 70◦ = 90◦, so the angles are complementary. We have the correct solution. Answer: 21 and 69 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2.

Our variable dictionary will take the form of a diagram, naming the width and length W and L, respectively. L W L W 2. Set up a System of Equations. The perimeter is found by summing the four sides of the rectangle. P = L+W + L+W P = 2L+ 2W We’re told the perimeter is 280 feet, so we can substitute 280 for P in the last equation. 280 = 2L+ 2W 284 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2, giving the following result: L+W = 140 Secondly, we’re told that the “length is 10 feet less than twice the width.” This translates to: L = 2W − 10 Thus, the system we need to solve is: L+W = 140 (4.33) L = 2W − 10 (4.34) 3. Solve the System. As equation (4.34) is already solved for L, let use the substitution method and substitute 2W − 10 for L in equation (4.33). W + L = 140 Equation (4.33). W + (2W − 10) = 140 Substitute 2W − 10 for L. 3W − 10 = 140 Combine like terms. 3W = 150 Add 10 to both sides. W = 50 Divide both sides by 3. 4. Answer the Question. The width is W = 50 feet. The length is: L = 2W − 10 Equation (4.34). L = 2(50)− 10 Substitute 50 for W . L = 90 Simplify. Thus, the length is L = 90 feet. 5. Look Back. Perhaps a picture, labeled with our answers might best demonstrate that we have the correct solution. Remember, we found that the width was 50 feet and the length was 90 feet. 90 50 90 50 Note that the perimeter is P = 90 + 50 + 90 + 50 = 280 feet. Secondly, note that the length 90 feet is 10 feet less than twice the width. So we have the correct solution. Answer: length = 134, width = 50 ! 4.4. APPLICATIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEMS 285 You Try It!

Set up a Variable Dictionary. Let D represent the number of dimes and let Q represent the number of quarters. 2. Set up a System of Equations. Using a table to summarize information is a good strategy. In the first column, we list the type of coin. The second column gives the number of each type of coin, and the third column contains the value (in cents) of the number of coins in Pascal’s pocket. Number of Coins Value (in cents) Dimes D 10D Quarters Q 25Q Totals 22 325 Note that D times, valued at 10 cents apiece, are worth 10D cents. Sim- ilarly, Q quarters, valued at 25 cents apiece, are worth 25Q cents. Note also how we’ve change $3.25 to 325 cents. The second column of the table gives us our first equation. D +Q = 22 (4.35) The third column of the table gives us our second equation. 10D + 25Q = 325 (4.36) 3. Solve the System. Because equations (4.35) and (4.36) are both in stan- dard form Ax + By = C, we’ll use the elimination method to find a solution. Because the question asks us to find the number of dimes in Pascal’s pocket, we’ll focus on eliminating the Q-terms and keeping the D-terms. −25D − 25Q = −550 Multiply equation (4.35) by −25. 10D + 25Q = 325 Equation (4.36). −15D = −225 Add the equations. Dividing both sides of the last equation by −15 gives us D = 15. 4. Answer the Question. The previous solution tells us that Pascal has 15 dimes in his pocket. 286 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS 5. Look Back. Again, summarizing results in a table might help us see if we have the correct solution. First, because we’re told that Pascal has 22 coins in all, and we found that he had 15 dimes, this means that he must have 7 quarters.

Find the amount invested in each account. two accounts, one portion in a certificate of deposit that pays 4% interest per year, and the rest in a mutual fund that pays 5% per year. At the end of the first year, Rosa’s investments earn a total of $420 in interest. Find the amount invested in each account. Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Let C represent the amount invested in the certificate of deposit and M represent the amount invested in the mutual fund. 2. Set up a System of Equations. We’ll again use a table to summarize information. Rate Amount invested Interest Certificate of Deposit 4% C 0.04C Mutual Fund 5% M 0.05M Totals 10,000 420 At 4%, the interest earned on a C dollars investment is found by taking 4% of C (i.e., 0.04C). Similarly, the interest earned on the mutual fund is 0.05M . 4.4. APPLICATIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEMS 287 The third column of the table gives us our first equation. The total investment is $10,000. C +M = 10000 The fourth column of the table gives us our second equation. The total interest earned is the sum of the interest earned in each account. 0.04C + 0.05M = 420 Let’s clear the decimals from the last equation by multiplying both sides of the equation by 100. 4C + 5M = 42000 Thus, the system we need to solve is: C +M = 10000 (4.37) 4C + 5M = 42000 (4.38) 3. Solve the System. Because equations (4.37) and (4.38) are both in stan- dard form Ax + By = C, we’ll use the elimination method to find a solution. We’ll focus on eliminating the C-terms. −4C − 4M = −40000 Multiply equation (4.37) by −4. 4C + 5M = 42000 Equation (4.38). M = 2000 Add the equations. Thus, the amount invested in the mutual fund in M = $2, 000. 4. Answer the Question. The question asks us to find the amount invested in each account. So, substitute M = 2000 in equation (4.37) and solve for C. C +M = 10000 Equation (4.37). C + 2000 = 10000 Substitute 2000 for M . C = 8000 Subtract 2000 from both sides. Thus C = $8, 000 was invested in the certificate of deposit. 5. Look Back. First, note that the investments in the certificate of deposit and the mutual fund, $8,000 and $2,000 respectively, total $10,000. Let’s calculate the interest on each investment: 4% of $8,000 is $320 and 5% of $2,000 is $100. Rate Amount invested Interest Certificate of Deposit 4% 8, 000 320 Mutual Fund 5% 2, 000 100 Totals 10,000 420 288 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS Note that the total interest is $420, as required in the problem statement. Thus, our solution is correct. Answer: $13,000 in the certificate of deposit, $27,000 in the mutual fund. ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 5.

How many pounds of peanuts and how many pounds of pecans should you mix to make a 25-lb mixture costing $5.80 per pound? pound. If you were a shop owner, how many pounds of peanuts and cashews should you mix to make 50 pounds of a peanut-cashew mixture costing $0.95 per pound? Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a Variable Dictionary. Let P be the number of pounds of peanuts used and let C be the number of pounds of cashews used. 2. Set up a System of Equations. We’ll again use a table to summarize information. Cost per pound Amount (pounds) Cost Peanuts $0.50 P 0.50P Cashews $1.25 C 1.25C Totals $0.95 50 0.95(50)=47.50 At $0.50 per pound, P pounds of peanuts cost 0.50P . At $1.25 per pound, C pounds of cashews cost 1.25C. Finally, at $0.95 per pound, 50 pounds of a mixture of peanuts and cashews will cost 0.95(50), or $47.50. The third column of the table gives us our first equation. The total number of pounds of mixture is given by the following equation: P + C = 50 The fourth column of the table gives us our second equation. The total cost is the sum of the costs for purchasing the peanuts and cashews. 0.50P + 1.25C = 47.50 Let’s clear the decimals from the last equation by multiplying both sides of the equation by 100. 50P + 125C = 4750 Thus, the system we need to solve is: P + C = 50 (4.39) 50P + 125C = 4750 (4.40) 4.4. APPLICATIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEMS 289 3. Solve the System. Because equations (4.39) and (4.40) are both in stan- dard form Ax + By = C, we’ll use the elimination method to find a solution. We’ll focus on eliminating the P -terms. −50P − 50C = −2500 Multiply equation (4.39) by −50. 50P + 125C = 4750 Equation (4.40). 75C = 2250 Add the equations. Divide both sides by 75 to get C = 30 pounds of cashews are in the mix. 4. Answer the Question. The question asks for both amounts, peanuts and cashews. Substitute C = 30 in equation (4.39) to determine P . P + C = 50 Equation (4.39). P + 30 = 50 Substitute 30 for C. P = 20 Subtract 30 from both sides. Thus, there are P = 20 pounds of peanuts in the mix. 5. Look Back. First, note that the amount of peanuts and cashews in the mix is 20 and 30 pounds respectively, so the total mixture weighs 50 pounds as required. Let’s calculate the costs: for the peanuts, 0.50(20), or $10, for the cashews, 1.25(30) = 37.50. Cost per pound Amount (pounds) Cost Peanuts $0.50 20 $10.00 Cashews $1.25 30 $37.50 Totals $0.95 50 47.50 Note that the total cost is $47.50, as required in the problem statement. Thus, our solution is correct. Answer: 10 pounds of peanuts, 15 pounds of pecans ! 290 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS ! ! !  ||
