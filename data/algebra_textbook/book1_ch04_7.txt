 || Expanding (a + b)2 and (a − b)2 Squaring a Binomial To square a binomial: * Square the first term. Take the product of the two terms and double it. Square the last term. Add the three results together.  || Expanding (a + b)(a − b) Sum and Difference of Two Terms To expand the sum and difference of two terms: † Square the first term and square the second term. Subtract the square of the second term from the square of the first term. ( a + b )( a − b ) = a 2 − b 2 __________ * See problems 56 and 57 at the end of this section. † See problem 58.  ||
