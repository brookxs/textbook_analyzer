Simplifying Square Roots When variables occur in the radicand, we can often simplify the expression by removing the radical sign. We can do so by keeping in mind that the radicand is the square of some other expression. We can simplify a radical by seeking an expression whose square is the radicand. The following observations will help us find the square root of a variable quantity. Example 9.9.  Since is a square root of x 6 . Also Example 9.10.  Since is a square root of x 8 . Also Example 9.11.  Since is a square root of x 12 . Also These examples suggest the following rule: If a variable has an even exponent, its square root can be found by dividing that exponent by 2. The examples of Sample Set B illustrate the use of this rule. Simplifying Square Roots When variables occur in the radicand, we can often simplify the expression by removing the radical sign.
