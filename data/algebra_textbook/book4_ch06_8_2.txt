Nonterminating Divisions Let's consider two divisions: 9.8 ÷ 3.5 4÷ 3 Terminating Divisions Previously, we have considered divisions like example 1, which is an example of a terminating division. A terminating division is a division in which the quotient terminates after several divisions (the remainder is zero). Exact Divisions The quotient in this problem terminates in the tenths position. Terminating divi­sions are also called exact divisions. Nonterminating Division The division in example 2 is an example of a nonterminating division. A non-terminating division is a division that, regardless of how far we carry it out, always has a remainder. Repeating Decimal We can see that the pattern in the brace is repeated endlessly. Such a decimal quotient is called a repeating decimal.
