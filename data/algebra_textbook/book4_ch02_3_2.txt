Division Division is a description of repeated subtraction. In the process of division, the concern is how many times one number is contained in another number. For example, we might be interested in how many 5's are contained in 15. The word times is significant because it implies a relationship between division and multiplication. There are several notations used to indicate division. Suppose Q records the number of times 5 is contained in 15. We can indicate this by writing Each of these division notations describes the same number, represented here by the symbol . Each notation also converts to the same multiplication form. It is In division, Dividend the number being divided into is called the dividend. Divisor the number dividing into the dividend is the divisor. Quotient the result of the division is called the quotient. Sample Set A Find the following quotients using multiplication facts. Example 2.12.  Since , Notice also that Thus, 6 is contained in 18 three times. Example 2.13.  Since , Notice also that 3 could be subtracted exactly 8 times from 24. This implies that 3 is contained in 24 eight times. Example 2.14.  Since , Thus, there are 6 sixes in 36. Example 2.15.  Since , Thus, there are 8 nines in 72.
