The Distributive Property We now discuss a property that couples addition and multiplication. Consider the expression 2 · (3+ 5). The Rules Guiding Order of Operations require that we first simplify the expression inside the parentheses. 2 · (3 + 5) = 2 · 8 Add: 3 + 5 = 8 = 16 Multiply: 2 · 8 = 16 Alternatively, we can instead distribute the 2 times each term in the parenthe- ses. That is, we will first multiply the 3 by 2, then multiply the 5 by 2. Then we add the results. 2 · (3 + 5) = 2 · 3 + 2 · 5 Distribute the 2. = 6 + 10 Multiply: 2 · 3 = 6 and 2 · 5 = 10 = 16 Add: 6 + 10 = 16 Note that both methods produce the same result, namely 16. This example demonstrates an extremely important property of numbers called the distribu- tive property. The Distributive Property. Let a, b, and c be any numbers. Then: a · (b+ c) = a · b+ a · c That is, multiplication is distributive with respect to addition. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Use the distributive property to expand 2(3x+ 7). Expand: 5(2y + 7) Solution: First distribute the 2 times each term in the parentheses. Then simplify. 2(3x+ 7) = 2(3x) + 2(7) Use the distributive property. = 6x+ 14 Multiply: 2(3x) = 6x and 2(7) = 14 Thus, 2(3x+ 7) = 6x+ 14. Answer: 10y + 35 ! Multiplication is also distributive with respect to subtraction. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Use the distributive property to expand −2(5y − 6). Expand: −3(2z − 7) 62 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Solution: Change to addition by adding the opposite, then apply the dis- tributive property. −2(5y − 6) = −2(5y + (−6)) Add the opposite. = −2(5y) + (−2)(−6) Use the distributive property. = −10y + 12 Multiply: −2(5y) = −10y and (−2)(−6) = 12 Thus, −2(5y − 6) = −10y + 12.Answer: −6z + 21 !
