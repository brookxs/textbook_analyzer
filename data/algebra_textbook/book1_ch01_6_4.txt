Division of Fractions Reciprocals Two numbers whose product is 1 are reciprocals of each other. For example, since and are reciprocals of each other. Some other pairs of reciprocals are listed below.Reciprocals are used in division of fractions. Division of Fractions To divide a first fraction by a second fraction, multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. Reduce if possible. This method is sometimes called the “invert and multiply” method. Division of Fractions Reciprocals Two numbers whose product is 1 are reciprocals of each other.
