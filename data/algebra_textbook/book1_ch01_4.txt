 || Multiples Multiples When a whole number is multiplied by other whole numbers, with the exception of Multiples zero, the resulting products are called multiples of the given whole number. Table 1.1. Multiples of 2   Multiples of 3   Multiples of 8   Multiples of 10 2 · 1 = 2   3 · 1 = 3   8 · 1 = 8   10 · 1 = 10 2 · 2 = 4   3 · 2 = 6   8 · 2 = 16   10 · 2 = 20 2 · 3 = 6   3 · 3 = 9   8 · 3 = 24   10 · 3 = 30 2 · 4 = 8   3 · 4 = 12   8 · 4 = 32   10 · 4 = 40 2 · 5 = 10   3 · 5 = 15   8 · 5 = 40   10 · 5 = 50 …   …   …   …  || Common Multiples There will be times when we are given two or more whole numbers and we will need to know if there are any multiples that are common to each of them. If there are, we will need to know what they are. For example, some of the multiples that are common to 2 and 3 are 6, 12, and 18.  || The Least Common Multiple (LCM) Notice that in our number line visualization of common multiples (above) the first common multiple is also the smallest, or least common multiple, abbreviated by LCM. Least Common Multiple The least common multiple, LCM, of two or more whole numbers is the smallest whole number that each of the given numbers will divide into without a remainder.  || Finding The Least Common Multiple Finding the LCM To find the LCM of two or more numbers, Write the prime factorization of each number, using exponents on repeated factors. Write each base that appears in each of the prime factorizations. To each base, attach the largest exponent that appears on it in the prime factorizations. The LCM is the product of the numbers found in step 3.  ||
