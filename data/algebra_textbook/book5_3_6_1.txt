Slope-Intercept to Standard Form We’ve already transformed a couple of equations in standard form into slope- intercept form. Let’s reverse the process and place an equation in slope- intercept form into standard form. 3.6. STANDARD FORM OF A LINE 231 You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Given the graph of the line in Figure 3.91, find the equation Given the graph of the line below, find the equation of the line in standard form. −5 5 −5 5 x y of the line in standard form. −5 5 −5 5 x y Figure 3.91: Determine the equa- tion of the line. −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 5 ∆x = −2 (0,−3) Figure 3.92: The line has y- intercept (0,−3) and slope −5/2. Solution: The line intercepts the y-axis at (0,−3). From (0,−3), move up 5 units, then left 2 units. Thus, the line has slope ∆y/∆x = −5/2 (see Figure 3.92). Substitute −5/2 for m and −3 for b in the slope-intercept form of the line. y = mx+ b Slope-intercept form. y = −5 2 x− 3 Substitute: −5/2 for m, −3 for b. To put this result in standard form Ax + By = C, first clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by the common denominator. 2y = 2 [ −5 2 x− 3 ] Multiply both sides by 2. 2y = 2 [ −5 2 x ] − 2 [3] Distribute the 2. 2y = −5x− 6 Multiply. That clears the fractions. To put this last result in the form Ax+By = C, we need to move the term −5x to the other side of the equation. 5x+ 2y = −5x− 6 + 5x Add 5x to both sides. 5x+ 2y = −6 Simplify. 232 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING Thus, the standard form of the line is 5x + 2y = −6. Note that all the coeffi- cients are integers and the terms are arranged in the order Ax+By = C, with A ≥ 0.Answer: 3x− 4y = −2 !
