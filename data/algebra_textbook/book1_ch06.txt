 ||  || Products of Polynomials Previously, we studied multiplication of polynomials (Section Section 4.6). We were given factors and asked to find their product, as shown below. Example 6.1.  Given the factors 4and 8, find the product. 4⋅8 = 32 . The product is 32. Example 6.2.  Given the factors 6x 2 and 2 x − 7 , find the product. 6 x 2 ( 2 x − 7 ) = 12 x 3 − 42 x 2 The product is 12 x 3 − 42 x 2 . Example 6.3.  Given the factors x − 2 y and 3 x + y , find the product. The product is 3x 2 − 5x y − 2y 2 . Example 6.4.  Given the factors a + 8 and a + 8 , find the product. (a + 8) 2 = a 2 + 16a + 64 The product is a 2 + 16a + 64 .  || Factoring Now, let’s reverse the situation. We will be given the product, and we will try to find the factors. This process, which is the reverse of multiplication, is called factoring. Factoring Factoring is the process of determining the factors of a given product.  ||  || The Factorization Process We introduce the process of factoring a monomial from a polynomial by examining a problem: Suppose that 12x 2 + 20x is the product and one of the factors is 4x . To find the other factor we could set up the problem this way: 4x⋅(               ) = 12x 2 + 20x Since the product 12x 2 + 20x consists of two terms, the expression multiplying 4x must consist of two terms, since, by the distributive property Now we see that this problem is simply an extension of finding the factors of a monomial. Thus, 4x⋅( 3x + 5 ) = 12x 2 + 20x . Usually, these divisions can be done mentally and the terms of the factor filled in directly.  ||  || Factoring Method In the last two types of problems (Sections Section 6.2 and Section 6.3), we knew one of the factors and were able to determine the other factor through division. Suppose, now, we’re given the product without any factors. Our problem is to find the factors, if possible. This procedure and the previous two procedures are based on the distributive property. We will use the distributive property in reverse. We notice that in the product, a is common to both terms. (In fact, a is a common factor of both terms.) Since a is common to both terms, we will factor it out and write a(               ) Now we need to determine what to place inside the parentheses. This is the procedure of the previous section. Divide each term of the product by the known factor a. Thus, b and c are the required terms of the other factor. Hence, a b + a c = a(b + c) When factoring a monomial from a polynomial, we seek out factors that are not only common to each term of the polynomial, but factors that have these properties: The numerical coefficients are the largest common numerical coefficients. The variables possess the largest exponents common to all the variables.  || Greatest Common Factor A monomial factor that meets the above two requirements is called the greatest common factor of the polynomial.  ||  || Using Grouping to Factor a Polynomial Sometimes a polynomial will not have a particular factor common to every term. However, we may still be able to produce a factored form for the polynomial. The polynomial x 3 + 3 x 2 − 6 x − 18 has no single factor that is common to every term. However, we notice that if we group together the first two terms and the second two terms, we see that each resulting binomial has a particular factor common to both terms. Factor x 2 out of the first two terms, and factor − 6 out of the second two terms. x 2 (x + 3)  − 6(x + 3) Now look closely at this binomial. Each of the two terms contains the factor (x + 3) . Factor out (x + 3) . (x + 3) (x 2 − 6) is the final factorization. x 3 + 3x 2 − 6x − 18 =  (x + 3) (x 2 − 6)  || Knowing when to Try the Grouping Method We are alerted to the idea of grouping when the polynomial we are considering has either of these qualities: no factor common to all terms an even number of terms When factoring by grouping, the sign ( +  or  − ) of the factor we are taking out will usually (but not always) be the same as the sign of the first term in that group.  ||  || The Difference of Two Squares Recall that when we multiplied together the two binomials ( a + b ) and ( a − b ) , we obtained the product a 2 − b 2 . ( a + b ) ( a − b ) = a 2 − b 2 Perfect Square Notice that the terms a 2 and b 2 in the product can be produced by squaring a and b , respectively. A term that is the square of another term is called a perfect square. Thus, both a 2 and b 2 are perfect squares. The minus sign between a 2 and b 2 means that we are taking the difference of the two squares.Since we know that ( a + b ) ( a − b ) = a 2 − b 2 , we need only turn the equation around to find the factorization form. a 2 − b 2 = ( a + b ) ( a − b ) The factorization form says that we can factor a 2 − b 2 , the difference of two squares, by finding the terms that produce the perfect squares and substituting these quantities into the factorization form.When using real numbers (as we are), there is no factored form for the sum of two squares. That is, using real numbers, a 2 + b 2 cannot be factored  || Fundamental Rules of Factoring There are two fundamental rules that we follow when factoring: Fundamental Rules of Factoring Factor out all common monomials first. Factor completely.  || Perfect Square Trinomials Recall the process of squaring a binomial. Table 6.1. Our Method Is We Notice Square the first term. The first term of the product should be a perfect square. Take the product of the two terms and double it. The middle term of the product should be divisible by 2 (since it’s multiplied by 2). Square the last term. The last term of the product should be a perfect square. Perfect square trinomials always factor as the square of a binomial. To recognize a perfect square trinomial, look for the following features: The first and last terms are perfect squares. The middle term is divisible by 2, and if we divide the middle term in half (the opposite of doubling it), we will get the product of the terms that when squared produce the first and last terms. In other words, factoring a perfect square trinomial amounts to finding the terms that, when squared, produce the first and last terms of the trinomial, and substituting into one of the formula  ||  || Method Let’s consider the product of the two binomials ( x + 4 ) and ( x + 7 ) . Notice that the first term in the resulting trinomial comes from the product of the first terms in the binomials: x⋅x = x 2 . The last term in the trinomial comes from the product of the last terms in the binomials: 4⋅7 = 28 . The middle term comes from the addition of the outer and inner products: 7 x + 4 x = 11 x . Also, notice that the coefficient of the middle term is exactly the sum of the last terms in the binomials: 4 + 7 = 11 . The problem we’re interested in is that given a trinomial, how can we find the factors? When the leading coefficient (the coefficient of the quadratic term) is 1, the observations we made above lead us to the following method of factoring. Method of Factoring Write two sets of parentheses:. Place a binomial into each set of parentheses. The first term of each binomial is a factor of the first term of the trinomial. Determine the second terms of the binomials by determining the factors of the third term that when added together yield the coefficient of the middle term.  || Factoring Hints Factoring trinomials may take some practice, but with time and experience, you will be able to factor much more quickly. There are some clues that are helpful in determining the factors of the third term that when added yield the coefficient of the middle term. Factoring Hints Look at the sign of the last term: If the sign is positive, we know that the two factors must have the same sign, since ( + ) ( + ) = ( + ) and ( − ) ( − )  =  ( + ) . The two factors will have the same sign as the sign of the middle term. If the sign is negative, we know that two factors must have opposite signs, since ( + ) ( − ) = ( − ) and ( − ) ( + )  =  ( − ) .  ||  || The Method of Factorization In the last section we saw that we could easily factor trinomials of the form x 2 + b x + c by finding the factors of the constant c that add to the coefficient of the linear term b , as shown in the following example: Factor x 2 - 4 x - 21 .The third term of the trinomial is − 21 . We seek two numbers whose (a) product is − 21 and(b) sum is − 4 . The required numbers are − 7 and + 3 . x 2 - 4 x - 21 = ( x - 7 ) ( x + 3 ) The problem of factoring the polynomial a x 2 + b x + c , a≠1 , becomes more involved. We will study two methods of factoring such polynomials. Each method produces the same result, and you should select the method you are most comfortable with. The first method is called the trial and error method and requires some educated guesses. We will examine two examples (Sample Sets A and B). Then, we will study a second method of factoring. The second method is called the collect and discard method, and it requires less guessing than the trial and error method. Sample Set C illustrates the use of the collect and discard method. The Trial and Error Method of Factoring a x 2 + b x + c Trial and Error Method Consider the product Examining the trinomial 20 x 2 + 23 x + 6 , we can immediately see some factors of the first and last terms. Table 6.2. 20x 2 6 20x,  x 6,  1 10x,  2x 3,  2   5x,  4x   Our goal is to choose the proper combination of factors of the first and last terms that yield the middle term 23 x .Notice that the middle term comes from the sum of the outer and inner products in the multiplication of the two binomials. This fact provides us a way to find the proper combination. Look for the combination that when multiplied and then added yields the middle term. The proper combination we're looking for is  || The Trial and Error Method of Factoring a x 2 + b x + c Trial and Error Method Consider the product Examining the trinomial 20 x 2 + 23 x + 6 , we can immediately see some factors of the first and last terms.

The proper combination we're looking for is  || The Collect and Discard Method of Factoring a x 2 + b x + c Collect and Discard Method Consider the polynomial 6x 2 + x − 12 . We begin by identifying a and c . In this case, a = 6 and c = − 12 . We start out as we would with a = 1 .Now, compute a⋅c . a⋅c = (6)( − 12) = − 72 Find the factors of − 72 that add to 1, the coefficient of x , the linear term. The factors are 9 and − 8 . Include these factors in the parentheses. 6x 2 + x − 12 :   (6x + 9)(6x − 8) But we have included too much. We must eliminate the surplus. Factor each parentheses. 6x 2 + x − 12 :   3(2x + 3)⋅2(3x − 4) Discard the factors that multiply to a = 6 . In this case, 3 and 2. We are left with the proper factorization. 6x 2 + x − 12 = (2x + 3)(3x − 4)  ||
