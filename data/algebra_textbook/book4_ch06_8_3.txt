Denoting Nonterminating Quotients We use three dots at the end of a number to indicate that a pattern repeats itself endlessly. 4 ÷ 3 = 1 . 333 … Another way, aside from using three dots, of denoting an endlessly repeating pattern is to write a bar ( ¯ ) above the repeating sequence of digits. The bar indicates the repeated pattern of 3. Repeating patterns in a division can be discovered in two ways: As the division process progresses, should the remainder ever be the same as the dividend, it can be concluded that the division is nonterminating and that the pattern in the quotient repeats. This fact is illustrated in Example 6.54 of the section called “Sample Set A”. As the division process progresses, should the "product, difference" pattern ever repeat two consecutive times, it can be concluded that the division is nonter­minating and that the pattern in the quotient repeats. This fact is illustrated in Example 6.55 and 4 of the section called “Sample Set A”. Sample Set A Carry out each division until the repeating pattern can be determined. Example 6.54.  100 ÷ 27 When the remainder is identical to the dividend, the division is nonterminating. This implies that the pattern in the quotient repeats. 100÷27 = 3.70370370… The repeating block is 703. Example 6.55.  1 ÷ 9 We see that this “product, difference”pattern repeats. We can conclude that the division is nonterminating and that the quotient repeats. 1÷9 = 0.111… The repeating block is 1. Example 6.56.  Divide 2 by 11 and round to 3 decimal places. Since we wish to round the quotient to three decimal places, we'll carry out the division so that the quotient has four decimal places. The number .1818 rounded to three decimal places is .182. Thus, correct to three decimal places, 2 ÷ 11 = 0 . 182 Example 6.57.  Divide 1 by 6. We see that this “product, difference” pattern repeats. We can conclude that the division is nonterminating and that the quotient repeats at the 6. Practice Set A Carry out the following divisions until the repeating pattern can be determined.
