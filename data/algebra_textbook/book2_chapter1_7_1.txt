Grouping Symbols In a computation where more than one operation is involved, grouping symbols help tell us which operations to perform first. The grouping symbols Parentheses, brackets, braces, and the fraction bar are the common symbols used to group expressions and mathematical operations within a computation. commonly used in algebra are All of the above grouping symbols, as well as absolute value, have the same order of precedence. Perform operations inside the innermost grouping symbol or absolute value first.   Example 1: Simplify: 5 − ( 4 − 12 ) . Solution: Perform the operations within the parentheses first. In this case, first subtract 12 from 4. Answer: 13   Example 2: Simplify: 3 { − 2 [ − ( − 3 − 1 ) ] } . Solution: Answer: −24   Example 3: Simplify: 5 − ∣ ∣ 4 − ( − 3 ) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ − 3 ∣ ∣ − ( 5 − 7 ) . Solution: The fraction bar groups the numerator and denominator. They should be simplified separately. Answer: − 2 5   Try this! Simplify: − [ − 3 ( 2 + 3 ) ] .
