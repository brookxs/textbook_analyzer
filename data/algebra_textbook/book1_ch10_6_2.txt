Standard Form Of A Quadratic Equation We have observed that a quadratic equation is an equation of the formwhere a is the coefficient of the quadratic term, b is the coefficient of the linear term, and c is the constant term. Standard Form The equation a x 2 + b x + c = 0 is the standard form of a quadratic equation.
