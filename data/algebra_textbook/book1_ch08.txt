 ||  || Rational Expressions In arithmetic it is noted that a fraction is a quotient of two whole numbers. The expression , where a and b are any two whole numbers and b ≠ 0, is called a fraction. The top number, a , is called the numerator, and the bottom number, b , is called the denominator. Simple Algebraic Fraction We define a simple algebraic fraction in a similar manner. Rather than restrict­ing ourselves only to numbers, we use polynomials for the numerator and denomi­nator. Another term for a simple algebraic fraction is a rational expression. A rational expression is an expression of the form , where P and Q are both polyno­mials and Q never represents the zero polynomial. Rational Expression A rational expression is an algebraic expression that can be written as the quotient of two polynomials. Examples 1–4 are rational expressions: Example 8.1.  is a rational expression: P is x + 9 and Q is x – 7. Example 8.2.  is a rational expression: P is x 3 + 5x 2 – 12x + 1 and Q is x 4 – 10. Example 8.3.  is a rational expression: P is 3 and Q is 8. Example 8.4.  4x – 5 is a rational expression since 4x – 5 can be written as : P is 4x – 5 and Q is 1. Example 8.5.  is not a rational expression since is not a polynomial. In the rational expression , P is called the numerator and Q is called the denominator. Domain of a Rational Expression Since division by zero is not defined, we must be careful to note the values for which the rational expression is valid. The collection of values for which the rational expression is defined is called the domain of the rational expression. (Recall our study of the domain of an equation in Section Section 4.8.) Finding the Domain of a Rational Expression To find the domain of a rational expression we must ask, "What values, if any, of the variable will make the denominator zero?" To find these values, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve. If any zero-producing values are obtained, they are not included in the domain. All other real numbers are included in the domain (unless some have been excluded for particular situational reasons).  || Zero-Factor Property Sometimes to find the domain of a rational expression, it is necessary to factor the denominator and use the zero-factor property of real numbers. Zero-factor Property If two real numbers a and b are multiplied together and the resulting product is 0, then at least one of the factors must be zero, that is, either a = 0, b = 0, or both a = 0 and b = 0. The following examples illustrate the use of the zero-factor property. Example 8.6.  What value will produce zero in the expression 4x ? By the zero-factor property, if 4x = 0, then x = 0. Example 8.7.  What value will produce zero in the expression 8(x – 6)? By the zero-factor property, if 8(x – 6) = 0, then Thus, 8(x – 6) = 0 when x = 6. Example 8.8.  What value(s) will produce zero in the expression (x – 3)(x + 5)? By the zero-factor property, if (x – 3)(x + 5) = 0, then Thus, (x – 3)(x + 5) = 0 when x = 3 or x = – 5. Example 8.9.  What value(s) will produce zero in the expression x 2 + 6x + 8? We must factor x 2 + 6x + 8 to put it into the zero-factor property form. x 2 + 6x + 8 = (x + 2)(x + 4) Now, (x + 2)(x + 4) = 0 when Thus, x 2 + 6x + 8 = 0 when x = – 2 or x = – 4. Example 8.10.  What value(s) will produce zero in the expression 6x 2 – 19x – 7? We must factor 6x 2 – 19x – 7 to put it into the zero-factor property form. 6x 2 – 19x – 7 = (3x + 1)(2x – 7) Now, (3x + 1)(2x – 7) = 0 when Thus, 6x 2 – 19x – 7 = 0 when or .  || The Equality Property of Fractions From our experience with arithmetic we may recall the equality property of fractions. Let a , b , c , d be real numbers such that b ≠ 0 and d ≠ 0. Equality Property of Fractions If , then a d = b c . If a d = b c , then . Two fractions are equal when their cross-products are equal. We see this property in the following examples: Example 8.19.  , since 2 · 12 = 3 · 8. Example 8.20.  , since 5y · 6y = 2 · 15y 2 and 30y 2 = 30y 2 . Example 8.21.  Since 9a · 4 = 18a · 2, .  || The Negative Property of Fractions A useful property of fractions is the negative property of fractions. Negative Property of Fractions The negative sign of a fraction may be placed in front of the fraction, , in the numerator of the fraction, , in the denominator of the fraction, . All three fractions will have the same value, that is, The negative property of fractions is illustrated by the fractions To see this, consider . Is this correct?By the equality property of fractions, – (3 · 4) = – 12 and – 3 · 4 = – 12. Thus, . Convince yourself that the other two fractions are equal as well. This same property holds for rational expressions and negative signs. This property is often quite helpful in simplifying a rational expression (as we shall need to do in subsequent sections). If either the numerator or denominator of a fraction or a fraction itself is immediately preceded by a negative sign, it is usually most convenient to place the negative sign in the numerator for later operations.  ||  || The Logic Behind The Process When working with rational expressions, it is often best to write them in the simplest possible form. For example, the rational expression can be reduced to the simpler expression for all x except x = 2,4 . From our discussion of equality of fractions in Section Section 8.2, we know that when a d = b c . This fact allows us to deduce that, if since a k b = a b k (recall the commutative property of multiplication). But this fact means that if a factor (in this case, k ) is common to both the numerator and denominator of a fraction, we may remove it without changing the value of the fraction. Cancelling The process of removing common factors is commonly called cancelling. Example 8.27.  can be reduced to .   Process:Remove the three factors of 1; Notice that in , there is no factor common to the numerator and denominator. Example 8.28.  can be reduced to .   Process: Remove the factor of 1;. Notice that in , there is no factor common to the numerator and denominator. Example 8.29.  can be reduced to .   Process: Remove the factor of 1;. Notice that in there is no factor common to the numerator and denominator. Example 8.30.  cannot be reduced since there are no factors common to the numerator and denominator. Problems 1, 2, and 3 shown above could all be reduced. The process in each reduction included the following steps: Both the numerator and denominator were factored. Factors that were common to both the numerator and denominator were noted and removed by dividing them out. We know that we can divide both sides of an equation by the same nonzero number, but why should we be able to divide both the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same nonzero number? The reason is that any nonzero number divided by itself is 1, and that if a number is multiplied by 1, it is left unchanged. Consider the fraction . Multiply this fraction by 1. This is written . But 1 can be rewritten as . The answer, , is the reduced form. Notice that in there is no factor common to both the numerator and denominator. This reasoning provides justification for the following rule. Cancelling Multiplying or dividing the numerator and denominator by the same nonzero number does not change the value of a fraction.  || Cancelling The process of removing common factors is commonly called cancelling.

Reducing a Rational Expression Factor the numerator and denominator completely. Divide the numerator and denominator by all factors they have in common, that is, remove all factors of 1. Reduced to Lowest Terms A rational expression is said to be reduced to lowest terms when the numerator and denominator have no factors in common.  || Excercises For the following problems, reduce each rational expression to lowest terms.

To multiply rational numbers, we do the following: Definition: Method for Multiplying Rational Numbers Reduce each fraction to lowest terms. Multiply the numerators together. Multiply the denominators together. Rational expressions are multiplied together using exactly the same three steps. Since rational expressions tend to be longer than arithmetic fractions, we can simplify the multiplication process by adding one more step.

Using the fact that , and that 1 is the multiplicative identity, it follows that if is a rational expression, then This equation asserts that a rational expression can be transformed into an equivalent rational expression by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the same nonzero number. Process of Building Rational Expressions This process is known as the process of building rational expressions and it is exactly the opposite of reducing rational expressions. The process is shown in these examples: Example 8.50.  can be built to since Example 8.51.  can be built to since Example 8.52.  can be built to since Example 8.53.  can be built to since Suppose we're given a rational expression and wish to build it into a rational expression with denominator Q b 2 , that is, Since we changed the denominator, we must certainly change the numerator in the same way. To determine how to change the numerator we need to know how the denominator was changed. Since one rational expression is built into another equivalent expression by multiplication by 1, the first denominator must have been multiplied by some quantity. Observation of tells us that Q was multiplied by b 2 . Hence, we must multiply the numerator P by b 2 . Thus, Quite often a simple comparison of the original denominator with the new denominator will tell us the factor being used. However, there will be times when the factor is unclear by simple observation. We need a method for finding the factor. Observe the following examples; then try to speculate on the method. Example 8.54.  The original denominator 4 was multiplied by 5 to yield 20. What arithmetic process will yield 5 using 4 and 20? Example 8.55.  The original denominator 10 was multiplied by y to yield 10y . Example 8.56.  The original denominator 2a 3 b was multiplied by 8a 2 b 2 to yield 16a 5 b 3 . Example 8.57.  The original denominator ( a + 1 ) 2 was multiplied by 4( a − 2 ) to yield 4 ( a + 1 ) 2 ( a − 2 ) . To determine the quantity that the original denominator was multiplied by to yield the new denominator, we ask, "What did I multiply the original denominator by to get the new denominator?" We find this factor by dividing the original denominator into the new denominator. It is precisely this quantity that we multiply the numerator by to build the rational expression.  || The Reason For Building Rational Expressions Building Rational Expressions Normally, when we write a rational expression, we write it in reduced form. The reason for building rational expressions is to make addition and subtraction of rational expressions convenient (simpler). To add or subtract two or more rational expressions they must have the same denominator. Building rational expressions allows us to transform fractions into fractions with the same denominators (which we can then add or subtract). The most convenient new denominator is the least common denominator (LCD) of the given fractions.  || The Least Common Denominator (LCD) In arithmetic, the least common denominator is the smallest (least) quantity that each of the given denominators will divide into without a remainder. For algebraic expressions, the LCD is the polynomial of least degree divisible by each denominator. Some examples are shown below. Example 8.65.  The LCD is 12 since 12 is the smallest number that 4, 6, and 12 will divide into without a remainder. Example 8.66.  The LCD is 24 since 24 is the smallest number that 3, 6, 8, and 12 will divide into without a remainder. Example 8.67.  The LCD is x 2 since x 2 is the smallest quantity that x and x 2 will divide into without a remainder. Example 8.68.  The LCD is 24a 2 b 3 since 24a 2 b 3 is the smallest quantity that 6a 2 b and 8a b 3 will divide into without a remainder. Example 8.69.  The LCD is ( y − 6 ) 3 ( y − 1 ) since ( y − 6 ) 3   ·  ( y − 1 ) is the smallest quantity that y − 6, ( y − 6 ) 3 and y − 1 will divide into without a remainder. We’ll now propose and demonstrate a method for obtaining the LCD. Method for Obtaining the LCD Factor each denominator. Use exponents for repeated factors. It is usually not necessary to factor numerical quantities. Write down each different factor that appears. If a factor appears more than once, use only the factor with the highest exponent. The LCD is the product of the factors written in step 2.  || Excercises For Review Exercise 8.5.97. (Section 6.4) Factor m 2 x 3 + m x 2 + m x. Exercise 8.5.98.

(Section 8.4) Find the quotient:  ||  || Basic Rule We are now in a position to study the process of adding and subtracting rational expressions. There is a most basic rule to which we must strictly adhere if we wish to conveniently add or subtract rational expressions. To add or subtract rational expressions conveniently, they should have the same denominators. Thus, to add or subtract two or more rational expressions conveniently, we must ensure that they all have the same denominator. The denominator that is most convenient is the LCD.  || Fractions With The Same Denominator The Rule for Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions To add (or subtract) two or more rational expressions with the same denominators, add (or subtract) the numerators and place the result over the LCD. Reduce if necessary. Symbolically, Note that we combine only the numerators.  || Fractions with Different Denominators  ||  || Rational Equations Rational Equations When one rational expression is set equal to another rational expression, a rational equation results.Some examples of rational equations are the following (except for number 5): Example 8.93.  Example 8.94.  Example 8.95.  Example 8.96.  Example 8.97.  is a rational expression, not a rational equation.  || Rational Equations When one rational expression is set equal to another rational expression, a rational equation results.Some examples of rational equations are the following (except for number 5): Example 8.93.  Example 8.94.  Example 8.95.  Example 8.96.  Example 8.97.  is a rational expression, not a rational equation.  || The Logic Behind The Process It seems most reasonable that an equation without any fractions would be easier to solve than an equation with fractions. Our goal, then, is to convert any rational equation to an equation that contains no fractions. This is easily done.To develop this method, let’s consider the rational equation The LCD is 12. We know that we can multiply both sides of an equation by the same nonzero quantity, so we’ll multiply both sides by the LCD, 12. Now distribute 12 to each term on the left side using the distributive property. Now divide to eliminate all denominators. Now there are no more fractions, and we can solve this equation using our previous techniques to obtain 5 as the solution.  || The Process We have cleared the equation of fractions by multiplying both sides by the LCD. This development generates the following rule. Clearing an Equation of Fractions To clear an equation of fractions, multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD. When multiplying both sides of the equation by the LCD, we use the distributive property to distribute the LCD to each term. This means we can simplify the above rule. Clearing an Equation of Fractions To clear an equation of fractions, multiply every term on both sides of the equation by the LCD. The complete method for solving a rational equation is 1. Determine all the values that must be excluded from consideration by finding the values that will produce zero in the denominator (and thus, division by zero). These excluded values are not in the domain of the equation and are called nondomain values. 2. Clear the equation of fractions by multiplying every term by the LCD. 3. Solve this nonfractional equation for the variable. Check to see if any of these potential solutions are excluded values. 4. Check the solution by substitution.  || Extraneous Solutions Extraneous Solutions Potential solutions that have been excluded because they make an expression undefined (or produce a false statement for an equation) are called extraneous solutions. Extraneous solutions are discarded. If there are no other potential solutions, the equation has no solution.  ||  || The Five-Step Method We are now in a position to study some applications of rational equations. Some of these problems will have practical applications while others are intended as logic developers. We will apply the five-step method for solving word problems. Five-Step Method Represent all unknown quantities in terms of x or some other letter. Translate the verbal phrases to mathematical symbols and form an equation. Solve this equation. Check the solution by substituting the result into the original statement of the problem. Write the conclusion. Remember, step 1 is very important: always Introduce a variable.  ||  || Simple And Complex Fractions Simple Fraction In Section Section 8.2 we saw that a simple fraction was a fraction of the form where P and Q are polynomials and Q ≠ 0 . Complex Fraction A complex fraction is a fraction in which the numerator or denominator, or both, is a fraction. The fractions are examples of complex fractions, or more generally, complex rational expressions. There are two methods for simplifying complex rational expressions: the combine-divide method and the LCD-multiply-divide method.  || The Combine-Divide Method If necessary, combine the terms of the numerator together. If necessary, combine the terms of the denominator together. Divide the numerator by the denominator.  || The LCD-Multiply-Divide Method Find the LCD of all the terms. Multiply the numerator and denominator by the LCD. Reduce if necessary.  ||  || Dividing A Polynomial By A Monomial The following examples illustrate how to divide a polynomial by a monomial. The division process is quite simple and is based on addition of rational expressions. Turning this equation around we get Now we simply divide c into a , and c into b . This should suggest a rule. Dividing a Polynomial By a Monomial To divide a polynomial by a monomial, divide every term of the polynomial by the monomial.  || The Process Of Division In Section Section 8.3 we studied the method of reducing rational expressions. For example, we observed how to reduce an expression such as Our method was to factor both the numerator and denominator, then divide out common factors. When the numerator and denominator have no factors in common, the division may still occur, but the process is a little more involved than merely factoring. The method of dividing one polynomial by another is much the same as that of dividing one number by another. First, we’ll review the steps in dividing numbers.  We are to divide 35 by 8.   We try 4, since 32 divided by 8 is 4. Multiply 4 and 8. Subtract 32 from 35. Since the remainder 3 is less than the divisor 8, we are done with the 32 division.   The quotient is expressed as a mixed number. The process was to divide, multiply, and subtract.  || Review Of Subtraction Of Polynomials A very important step in the process of dividing one polynomial by another is subtraction of polynomials. Let’s review the process of subtraction by observing a few examples. 1. Subtract x − 2 from x − 5; that is, find ( x − 5 ) − ( x − 2 ).  Since   x − 2 is preceded by a minus sign, remove the parentheses, change the sign of each term, then add. The result is − 3. 2. Subtract x 3 + 3x 2 from x 3 + 4x 2 + x − 1.  Since x 3 + 3x 2 is preceded by a minus sign, remove the parentheses, change the sign of each term, then add. The result is x2 + x − 1. 3. Subtract x 2 + 3x from x 2 + 1.  We can write x 2 + 1 as x 2 + 0x + 1.  || Dividing A Polynomial By A Polynomial Now we’ll observe some examples of dividing one polynomial by another. The process is the same as the process used with whole numbers: divide, multiply, subtract, divide, multiply, subtract,.... The division, multiplication, and subtraction take place one term at a time. The process is concluded when the polynomial remainder is of lesser degree than the polynomial divisor.  ||
