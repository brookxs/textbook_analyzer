 || The Closure Properties The Closure Properties If a and b are real numbers, then a + b is a unique real number, and a⋅b is a unique real number. For example, 3 and 11 are real numbers; 3 + 11 = 14 and 3⋅11 = 33, and both 14 and 33 are real numbers. Although this property seems obvious, some collections are not closed under certain operations. For example, Example 2.34.  The real numbers are not closed under division since, although 5 and 0 are real numbers, 5 / 0 and 0 / 0 are not real numbers. Example 2.35.  The natural numbers are not closed under subtraction since, although 8 is a natural number, 8 − 8 is not. ( 8 − 8 = 0 and 0 is not a natural number.)  || The Commutative Properties Let a and b represent real numbers. The Commutative Properties The commutative properties tell us that two numbers can be added or multiplied in any order without affecting the result.  || The Associative Properties Let a,b, and c represent real numbers. The Associative Properties The associative properties tell us that we may group together the quantities as we please without affecting the result.  || The Distributive Properties When we were first introduced to multiplication we saw that it was developed as a description for repeated addition. 4 + 4 + 4 = 3⋅4 Notice that there are three 4’s, that is, 4 appears 3 times. Hence, 3 times 4.We know that algebra is generalized arithmetic. We can now make an important generalization. When a number a is added repeatedly n times, we have Then, using multiplication as a description for repeated addition, we can replace For example: Example 2.47.  x + x + x + x can be written as 4x since x is repeatedly added 4 times. x + x + x + x = 4x Example 2.48.  r + r can be written as 2r since r is repeatedly added 2 times. r + r = 2r The distributive property involves both multiplication and addition. Let’s rewrite 4(a + b). We proceed by reading 4(a + b) as a multiplication: 4 times the quantity (a + b) . This directs us to write Now we use the commutative property of addition to collect all the a ' s together and all the b ' s together. Now, using multiplication as a description for repeated addition, we have We have distributed the 4 over the sum to both a and b . The Distributive Property The distributive property is useful when we cannot or do not wish to perform operations inside parentheses.  || The Identity Properties Additive Identity The number 0 is called the additive identity since when it is added to any real number, it preserves the identity of that number. Zero is the only additive identity.For example, 6 + 0 = 6 . Multiplicative Identity The number 1 is called the multiplicative identity since when it multiplies any real number, it preserves the identity of that number. One is the only multiplicative identity.For example 6⋅1 = 6 . We summarize the identity properties as follows.  || The Inverse Properties Additive Inverses When two numbers are added together and the result is the additive identity, 0, the numbers are called additive inverses of each other. For example, when 3 is added to − 3 the result is 0, that is, 3 + ( − 3) = 0 . The numbers 3 and − 3 are additive inverses of each other. Multiplicative Inverses When two numbers are multiplied together and the result is the multiplicative identity, 1, the numbers are called multiplicative inverses of each other. For example, when 6 and are multiplied together, the result is 1, that is, . The numbers 6 and are multiplicative inverses of each other. We summarize the inverse properties as follows. The Inverse Properties If a is any real number, then there is a unique real number − a , such that The numbers a and − a are called additive inverses of each other. If a is any nonzero real number, then there is a unique real number such that The numbers a and are called multiplicative inverses of each other. Expanding Quantities When we perform operations such as 6(a + 3) = 6a + 18 , we say we are expanding the quantity 6(a + 3) .  ||
