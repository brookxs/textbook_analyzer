Meaningful Expressions Since we know that the square of any real number is a positive number or zero, we can see that expressions such as do not describe real numbers. There is no real number that can be squared that will produce −16. For to be a real number, we must have x ≥ 0. In our study of algebra, we will assume that all variables and all expressions in radicands represent nonnegative numbers (numbers greater than or equal to zero).
