Multiplying Fractions Multiply Numerators and Denominators Example:      And reduce result if needed   Canceling common factors first makes multiplication easier If you don’t reduce the factors before multiplying, the answer will have to be reduced. Example:  Remember that canceling always leaves a “1” behind, because you are really dividing the numerator and the denominator by the same number.
