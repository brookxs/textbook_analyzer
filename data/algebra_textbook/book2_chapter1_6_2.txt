Square Root of a Real Number Think of finding the square root The number that, when multiplied by itself, yields the original number. of a number as the inverse of squaring a number. In other words, to determine the square root of 25 the question is, “What number squared equals 25?” Actually, there are two answers to this question, 5 and −5. When asked for the square root of a number, we implicitly mean the principal (nonnegative) square root The non-negative square root. . Therefore we have, As an example, 25 − − √ = 5 , which is read “square root of 25 equals 5.” The symbol √ is called the radical sign The symbol √ used to denote a square root. and 25 is called the radicand The expression a within a radical sign, a √ n . . The alternative textual notation for square roots follows: It is also worthwhile to note that This is the case because 1 2 = 1 and 0 2 = 0 .   Example 2: Simplify: 10,000 − − − − − √ . Solution: 10,000 is a perfect square because 100 ⋅ 100 = 10,000 . Answer: 100   Example 3: Simplify: 1 9 − − √ . Solution: Here we notice that 1 9 is a square because 1 3 ⋅ 1 3 = 1 9 . Answer: 1 3   Given a and b as positive real numbers, use the following property to simplify square roots whose radicands are not squares: The idea is to identify the largest square factor of the radicand and then apply the property shown above. As an example, to simplify 8 √ notice that 8 is not a perfect square. However, 8 = 4 ⋅ 2 and thus has a perfect square factor other than 1. Apply the property as follows: Here 2 2 √ is a simplified irrational number. You are often asked to find an approximate answer rounded off to a certain decimal place. In that case, use a calculator to find the decimal approximation using either the original problem or the simplified equivalent. On a calculator, try 2.83^2. What do you expect? Why is the answer not what you would expect? It is important to mention that the radicand must be positive. For example, − 9 − − − √ is undefined since there is no real number that when squared is negative. Try taking the square root of a negative number on your calculator. What does it say? Note: taking the square root of a negative number is defined later in the course.   Example 4: Simplify and give an approximate answer rounded to the nearest hundredth: 75 − − √ . Solution: The radicand 75 can be factored as 25 ⋅ 3 where the factor 25 is a perfect square. Answer: 75 − − √ ≈ 8.66   As a check, calculate 75 − − √ and 5 3 √ on a calculator and verify that the both results are approximately 8.66.   Example 5: Simplify: 180 − − − √ . Solution: Since the question did not ask for an approximate answer, we present the exact answer. Answer: 6 5 √   Example 5: Simplify: − 5 162 − − − √ . Solution: Answer: − 45 2 √   Try this! Simplify and give an approximate answer rounded to the nearest hundredth: 128 − − − √ .

A right triangle A triangle with an angle that measures 90°. is a triangle where one of the angles measures 90°. The side opposite the right angle is the longest side, called the hypotenuse The longest side of a right triangle, it will always be the side opposite the right angle. , and the other two sides are called legs The sides of a right triangle that are not the hypotenuse. . Numerous real-world applications involve this geometric figure. The Pythagorean theorem Given any right triangle with legs measuring a and b units and hypotenuse measuring c units, then a 2 + b 2 = c 2 . states that given any right triangle with legs measuring a and b units, the square of the measure of the hypotenuse c is equal to the sum of the squares of the measures of the legs: a 2 + b 2 = c 2 . In other words, the hypotenuse of any right triangle is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of its legs.   Example 6: If the two legs of a right triangle measure 3 units and 4 units, then find the length of the hypotenuse. Solution: Given the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, use the formula c = a 2 + b 2 − − − − − − √ to find the length of the hypotenuse. Answer: c = 5 units   When finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem, the radicand is not always a perfect square.   Example 7: If the two legs of a right triangle measure 2 units and 6 units, find the length of the hypotenuse. Solution: Answer: c = 2 10 − − √ units Square Root of a Real Number Think of finding the square root The number that, when multiplied by itself, yields the original number. of a number as the inverse of squaring a number.
