Calculators The calculator can be useful for finding quotients with single and multiple digit divisors. If, however, the division should result in a remainder, the calculator is unable to provide us with the particular value of the remainder. Also, some calculators (most nonscientific) are unable to perform divisions in which one of the numbers has more than eight digits. Sample Set D Use a calculator to perform each division. Example 2.29.  328 ÷ 8 Table 2.7. Type 328 Press ÷ Type 8 Press = The display now reads 41. Example 2.30.  53 , 136 ÷ 82 Table 2.8. Type 53136 Press ÷ Type 82 Press = The display now reads 648. Example 2.31.  730 , 019 , 001 ÷ 326 We first try to enter 730,019,001 but find that we can only enter 73001900. If our calculator has only an eight-digit display (as most nonscientific calculators do), we will be unable to use the calculator to perform this division. Example 2.32.  3727 ÷ 49 Table 2.9. Type 3727 Press ÷ Type 49 Press = The display now reads 76.061224. This number is an example of a decimal number (see Section 6.1). When a decimal number results in a calculator division, we can conclude that the division produces a remainder. Practice Set D Use a calculator to perform each division. Exercise 2.4.15.
