The Least Common Multiple (LCM) Notice that in our number line visualization of common multiples (above), the first common multiple is also the smallest, or least common multiple, abbreviated by LCM. Least Common Multiple The least common multiple, LCM, of two or more whole numbers is the smallest whole number that each of the given numbers will divide into without a remainder. The least common multiple will be extremely useful in working with fractions (Section 4.1).
