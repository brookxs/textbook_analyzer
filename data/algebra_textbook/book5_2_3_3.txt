Clearing Decimals from an Equation Multiplying by the appropriate power of ten will clear the decimals from an equation, making the resulting equivalent equation far easier to solve. Before we begin, first recall the following facts about multiplying by powers of ten. • 10(1.2345) = 12.345. Multiplying by 10 moves the decimal point one place to the right. • 100(1.2345) = 123.45. Multiplying by 100 moves the decimal point two places to the right. • 1000(1.2345) = 1234.5. Multiplying by 1000 moves the decimal point three places to the right. Note the pattern: The number of zeros in the power of ten determines the number of places to move the decimal point. So, for example, if we multiply by 1,000,000, which has six zeros, this will move the decimal point six places to the right. You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Solve for x: 2.3x− 1.25 = 0.04x.Solve for x: 1.34− 4.5x = 2.2 Solution: The first term of 2.3x − 1.25 = 0.04x has one decimal place, the second term has two decimal places, and the third and final term has two decimal places. At a minimum, we need to move each decimal point two places to the right in order to clear the decimals from the equation. Consequently, we multiply both sides of the equation by 100. 2.3x− 1.25 = 0.04x Original equation. 100(2.3x− 1.25) = 100(0.04x) Multiply both sides by 100. 100(2.3x)− 100(1.25) = 100(0.04x) Distribute the 100. 230x− 125 = 4x Multiplying by 100 moves all decimal points two places to the right. 2.3. CLEARING FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 107 Note that the decimals are now cleared from the equation. We must now isolate all terms containing x on one side of the equation. To remove the term 4x from the right-hand side, subtract 4x from both sides of the equation. 230x− 125− 4x = 4x− 4x Subtract 4x from both sides. 226x− 125 = 0 Simplify. To remove −125 from the left-hand side, add 125 to both sides of the equation. 226x− 125 + 125 = 0 + 125 Add 125 to both sides. 226x = 125 Simplify both sides. Finally, to “undo” multiplying by 226, divide both sides by 226. 226x 226 = 125 226 Divide both sides by 226. x = 125 226 Simplify. Check: Let’s check the answer with the TI-84. 1.
