 || Multiplication and Division Same rules as for rational numbers! Multiplication Both the numerators and the denominators multiply together Common factors may be cancelled before multiplying Example:    Given Equation: First factor all the expressions: (I also put the denominators in parentheses because then it is easier to see them as distinct factors) Now cancel common factors—any factor on the top can cancel with any factor on the bottom: Now just multiply what’s left. You usually do not have to multiply out the factors, just leave them as shown.   Division Multiply by the reciprocal of the divisor Invert the second fraction, then proceed with multiplication as above Do not attempt to cancel factors before it is written as a multiplication  || Addition and Subtraction Same procedure as for rational numbers! ·        Only the numerators can be added together, and only when all the denominators are the same Finding the LCD The LCD is built up of all the factors of the individual denominators, each factor included the most number of times it appears in an individual denominator. The product of all the denominators is always a common denominator, but not necessarily the LCD (the final answer may have to be reduced).   Example:  Given equation: Factor both denominators: Assemble the LCD: Note that the LCD contains both denominators Build up the fractions so that they both have the LCD for a denominator: (keep both denominators in factored form to make it easier to see what factors they need to look like the LCD) Now that they are over the same denominator, you can add the numerators: And simplify:  ||
