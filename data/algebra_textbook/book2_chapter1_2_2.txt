Distance on a Number Line One application of the absolute value is to find the distance between any two points on a number line. For real numbers a and b, the distance formula for a number line The distance between any two real numbers a and b on a number line can be calculated using the formula d = | b − a | . is given as,   Example 9: Determine the distance between 2 and 7 on a number line. Solution: On the graph we see that the distance between the two given integers is 5 units. Using the distance formula we obtain the same result. Answer: 5 units   Example 10: Determine the distance between −4 and 7 on a number line. Solution: Use the distance formula for a number line d = | b − a | , where a = − 4 and b = 7 . Answer: 11 units   It turns out that it does not matter which points are used for a and b; the absolute value always ensures a positive result. Using a = −4 and b = 7 Using a = 7 and b = −4 d = | 7 − ( − 4 ) | = | 7 + 4 | = | 11 | = 11 d = | − 4 − 7 | = | − 11 | = 11   Try this! Determine the distance between −12 and −9 on the number line.
