6.6 Factoring Strategy When you are concentrating on factoring problems of a single type, after doing a few you tend to get into a rhythm, and the remainder of the exercises, because they are similar, seem to flow. However, when you encounter a mixture of factoring problems of different types, progress is harder. The goal of this section is to set up a strategy to follow when attacking a general factoring problem. If it hasn’t already been done, it is helpful to arrange the terms of the given polynomial in some sort of order (descending or ascending). Then you want to apply the following guidelines. Factoring Strategy. These steps should be followed in the order that they appear. 1. Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF). 2. Look for a special form. a) If you have two perfect squares separated by a minus sign, use the difference of squares pattern to factor: a2 − b2 = (a+ b)(a− b) b) If you have a trinomial whose first and last terms are perfect squares, you should suspect that you have a perfect square trinomial. Take the square roots of the first and last terms and factor as follows. a2 + 2ab+ b2 = (a+ b)2 Be sure to check that the middle term is correct. 3. If you have a trinomial of the form ax2 + bx + c, use the ac-method to factor. 4. If you have a four-term expression, try to factor by grouping. Once you’ve applied the above strategy to the given polynomial, it is quite possible that one of your resulting factors will factor further. Thus, we have the following rule. Factor completely. The factoring process is not complete until none of your remaining factors can be factored further. This is the meaning of the phrase, “factor completely.” 6.6. FACTORING STRATEGY 457 Finally, a very good word of advice. Check your factoring by multiplying. Once you’ve factored the given polynomial completely, it is a very good practice to check your result. If you multiply to find the product of your factors, and get the original given polyno- mial as a result, then you know your factorization is correct. It’s a bit more work to check your factorization, but it’s worth the effort. It helps to eliminate errors and also helps to build a better understanding of the factoring process. Remember, factoring is “unmultiplying,” so the more you multiply, the better you get at factoring. Let’s see what can happen when you don’t check your factorization! Warning! The following solution is incorrect! Factor: 2x4 + 8x2. Solution: Factor out the GCF. 2x4 + 8x2 = 2x2(x2 + 4) = 2x2(x+ 2)2 Note that this student did not bother to check his factorization. Let’s do that for him now. Check: Multiply to check. Remember, when squaring a binomial, there is a middle term. 2x2(x+ 2)2 = 2x2(x2 + 4x+ 4) = 2x4 + 8x3 + 8x2 This is not the same as the original polynomial 2x4 + 8x2, so the student’s factorization is incorrect. Had the student performed this check, he might have caught his error, provided of course, that he multiplies correctly during the check. The correct factorization follows. 2x4 + 8x2 = 2x2(x2 + 4) The sum of squares does not factor, so we are finished. Check: Multiply to check. 2x2(x2 + 4) = 2x4 + 8x2 This is the same as the original polynomial 2x4 + 8x2, so this factorization is correct. 458 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Factor completely: −3x6 + 3x2Factor completely: −4x7 + 64x3 Solution: The first rule of factoring is “Factor out the GCF.” The GCF of −3x6 and 3x2 is 3x2, so we could factor out 3x2. −3x6 + 3x2 = 3x2(−x4 + 1) This is perfectly valid, but we don’t like the fact that the second factor starts with −x4. Let’s factor out −3x2 instead. −3x6 + 3x2 = −3x2(x4 − 1) The second factor is the difference of two squares. Take the square roots, separating one pair with a plus sign, one pair with a minus sign. = −3x2(x2 + 1)(x2 − 1) The sum of squares does not factor. But the last factor is the difference of two squares. Take the square roots, separating one pair with a plus sign, one pair with a minus sign. = −3x2(x2 + 1)(x+ 1)(x− 1) Check: Multiply to check the result. −3x2(x2 + 1)(x+ 1)(x− 1) = −3x2(x2 + 1)(x2 − 1) = −3x2(x4 − 1) = −3x6 + 3x2 The factorization checks.Answer: −4x3(x2 + 4)(x+ 2)(x− 2) ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Factor completely: x3y + 9xy3 + 6x2y2Factor completely: 3a2b4 + 12a4b2 − 12a3b3 Solution: The first rule of factoring is “Factor out the GCF.” The GCF of x3y, 9xy3, and 6x2y2 is xy, so we factor out xy. x3y + 9xy3 + 6x2y2 = xy(x2 + 9y2 + 6xy) Let’s order that second factor in descending powers of x. = xy(x2 + 6xy + 9y2) 6.6. FACTORING STRATEGY 459 The first and last terms of the trinomial factor are perfect squares. We suspect we have a perfect square trinomial, so we take the square roots of the first and last terms, check the middle term, and write: = xy(x+ 3y)2 Thus, x3y + 9xy3 + 6x2y2 = xy(x+ 3y)2. Check: Multiply to check the result. xy(x+ 3y)2 = xy(x2 + 6xy + 9y2) = x3y + 6x2y2 + 9xy3 Except for the order, this result is the same as the given polynomial. The factorization checks. Answer: 3a2b2(2a− b)2 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Factor completely: 2x3 − 48x+ 20x2 Factor completely: 27x3 − 3x4 − 60x2 Solution: In the last example, we recognized a need to rearrange our terms after we pulled out the GCF. This time, let’s arrange our terms in descending powers of x right away. 2x3 − 48x+ 20x2 = 2x3 + 20x2 − 48x Now, let’s factor out the GCF. = 2x(x2 + 10x− 24) The last term of the trinomial factor is not a perfect square. Let’s move to the ac-method to factor. The integer pair −2, 12 has a product equal to ac = −24 and a sum equal to b = 10. Because the coefficient of x2 is one, this is a “drop in place” situation. We drop our pair in place and write: = 2x(x − 2)(x+ 12) Thus, 2x3 − 48x+ 20x2 = 2x(x− 2)(x+ 12). Check: Multiply to check the result. We use the FOIL method shortcut and mental calculations to speed things up. 2x(x− 2)(x+ 12) = 2x(x2 + 10x− 24) = 2x3 + 20x2 − 48x Except for the order, this result is the same as the given polynomial. The factorization checks. Answer: −3x2(x− 4)(x− 5) ! 460 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Factor completely: 2a2 − 13ab− 24b2Factor completely: 8x2 + 14xy − 15y2 Solution: There is no common factor we can factor out. We have a trinomial, but the first and last terms are not perfect squares, so let’s apply the ac-method. Ignoring the variables for a moment, we need an integer pair whose product is ac = −48 and whose sum is −13. The integer pair 3,−16 comes to mind (if nothing comes to mind, start listing integer pairs). Break up the middle term into a sum of like terms using the integer pair 3,−16, then factor by grouping. 2a2 − 13ab− 24b2 = 2a2 + 3ab− 16ab− 24b2 = a(2a+ 3b)− 8b(2a+ 3b) = (a− 8b)(2a+ 3b) Thus, 2a2 − 13ab− 24b2 = (a− 8b)(2a+ 3b). Check: Multiply to check the result. We use the FOIL method shortcut and mental calculations to speed things up. (a− 8b)(2a+ 3b) = 2a2 − 13ab− 24b2 This result is the same as the given polynomial. The factorization checks.Answer: (2x+ 5y)(4x− 3y) ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Factor completely: 30x4 + 38x3 − 20x2Factor completely: 36x3 + 60x2 + 9x Solution: The first step is to factor out the GCF, which in this case is 2x2. 30x4 + 38x3 − 20x2 = 2x2(15x2 + 19x− 10) The first and last terms of the trinomial factor are not perfect squares, so let’s move again to the ac-method. Comparing 15x2+19x−10 with ax2+bx+c, note that ac = (15)(−10) = −150. We need an integer pair whose product is −150 and whose sum is 19. The integer pair −6 and 25 satisfies these requirements. Because a != 1, this is not a “drop in place” situation, so we need to break up the middle term as a sum of like terms using the pair −6 and 25. = 2x2(15x2 − 6x+ 25x− 10) Factor by grouping. Factor 3x out of the first two terms and 5 out of the third and fourth terms. = 2x2(3x(5x− 2) + 5(5x− 2)) 6.6. FACTORING STRATEGY 461 Finally, factor out the common factor 5x− 2. = 2x2(3x+ 5)(5x− 2) Thus, 30x4 + 38x3 − 20x2 = 2x2(3x+ 5)(5x− 2). Check: Multiply to check the result. Use the FOIL method to first multiply the binomials. 2x2(3x+ 5)(5x− 2) = 2x2(15x2 + 19x− 10) Distribute the 2x2. = 30x4 + 38x3 − 20x2 This result is the same as the given polynomial. The factorization checks. Answer: 3x(6x+ 1)(2x+ 3) ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Factor completely: 8x5 + 10x4 − 72x3 − 90x2 Factor completely: 15x6− 33x5− 240x4 +528x3 Solution: Each of the terms is divisible by 3x3. Factor out 3x3. 15x6 − 33x5 − 240x4 + 528x3 = 3x3 [5x3 − 11x2 − 80x+ 176] The second factor is a four-term expression. Factor by grouping. = 3x3 [ x2(5x− 11)− 16(5x− 11)] = 3x3(x2 − 16)(5x− 11) The factor x2−16 is a difference of two squares. Take the square roots, separate one pair with a plus, one pair with a minus. = 3x3(x+ 4)(x− 4)(5x− 11) Thus, 15x6 − 33x5 − 240x4 + 528x3 = 3x3(x+ 4)(x− 4)(5x− 11). Check: Multiply to check the result. 3x3(x+ 4)(x− 4)(5x− 11) = 3x3(x2 − 16)(5x− 11) = 3x3(5x3 − 11x2 − 80x+ 176 = 15x6 − 33x5 − 240x4 + 528x3 This result is the same as the given polynomial.
