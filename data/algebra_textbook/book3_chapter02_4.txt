 || The Addition Principle ·        Adding (or subtracting) the same number to both sides of an equation does not change its solution set. Think of the balance analogy—if both sides of the equation are equal, then increasing both sides by the same amount will change the value of each side, but they will still be equal. For example, if 3 = 3, then 3 + 2 = 3 + 2.   Consequently, if   6 + x = 8   for some value of x (which in this case is x = 2), then we can add any number to both sides of the equation and x = 2 will still be the solution. If we wanted to, we could add a 3 to both sides of the equation, producing the equation   9 + x = 11.   As you can see, x = 2 is still the solution. Of course, this new equation is no simpler than the one we started with, and this maneuver did not help us solve the equation. If we want to solve the equation   6 + x = 8,   the idea is to get x by itself on one side, and so we want to get rid of the 6 that is on the left side. We can do this by subtracting a 6 from both sides of the equation (which of course can be thought of as adding a negative six):   6 – 6 + x = 8 – 6 or x = 2   You can think of this operation as moving the 6 from one side of the equation to the other, which causes it to change sign   ·        The addition principle is useful in solving equations because it allows us to move whole terms from one side of the equal sign to the other. While this is a convenient way to think of it, you should remember that you are not really “moving” the term from one side to the other—you are really adding (or subtracting) the term on both sides of the equation.  || Notation notes In the previous example, we wrote the –6 in-line with the rest of the equation. This is analogous to writing an arithmetic subtraction problem in one line, as in   234 – 56 = 178.   You probably also learned to write subtraction and addition problems in a column format, like We can also use a similar notation for the addition method with algebraic equations. Given the equation   x + 3 = 2, we want to subtract a 3 from both sides in order to isolate the variable. In column format this would look like Here the numbers in the second row are negative 3’s, so we are adding the two rows together to produce the bottom row. The advantage of the column notation is that it makes the operation easier to see and reduces the chances for an error. The disadvantage is that it takes more space, but that is a relatively minor disadvantage. Which notation you prefer to use is not important, as long as you can follow what you are doing and it makes sense to you.  ||
