Using the Graphing Calculator The graphing calculator is a splendid tool for evaluating algebraic expressions, particularly when the numbers involved are large. 24 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Use the graphing calculator to simplify the following expres-Use the graphing calculator to evaluate −2− 2[−2− 2(−2− 2)]. sion. −213− 35[−18− 211(15− 223)] Solution. The first difficulty with this expression is the fact that the graphing calculator does not have a bracket symbol for the purposes of grouping. The calculator has only parentheses for grouping. So we first convert our expression to the following: −213− 35(−18− 211(15− 223)) Note that brackets and parentheses are completely interchangeable. The next difficulty is determining which of the minus signs are negation symbols and which are subtraction symbols. If the minus sign does not appear between two numbers, it is a negation symbol. If the minus sign does appear between two numbers, it is a subtraction symbol. Hence, we enter the following keystrokes on our calculator. The result is shown in Figure 1.8. (-) 2 1 3 − 3 5 × ( (-) 1 8 − 2 1 1 × ( 1 5 − 2 2 3 ) ) ENTER Figure 1.8: Calculating −213− 35[−18− 211(15− 223)]. Thus, −213− 35[−18− 211(15− 223)] = −1, 535, 663.Answer: −14 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Use the graphing calculator to evaluateUse the graphing calculator to evaluate 10 + 10 10 + 10 5 + 5 5 + 5 . 1.2. ORDER OF OPERATIONS 25 Solution. You might ask “Why do we need a calculator to evaluate this exceedingly simple expression?” After all, it’s very easy to compute. 5 + 5 5 + 5 = 10 10 Simplify numerator and denominator. = 1 Divide: 10/10 = 1. Well, let’s enter the expression 5+5/5+5 in the calculator and see how well we understand the Rules Guiding Order of Operations (see first image in Figure 1.9). Whoa! How did the calculator get 11? The answer is supposed to be 1! Let’s slow down and apply the Rules Guiding Order of Operations to the expression 5+5/5+5. 5 + 5/5 + 5 = 5 + 5 5 + 5 Divide first. = 5 + 1 + 5 Divide: 5 5 = 1. = 11 Add: 5 + 1 + 5 = 11. Aha! That’s how the calculator got 11. 5 + 5/5 + 5 is equivalent to 5 + 5 5 + 5 Let’s change the order of evaluation by using grouping symbols. Note that: (5 + 5)/(5 + 5) = 10/10 Parentheses first. = 1 Divide: 10/10 = 1. That is: (5 + 5)/(5 + 5) is equivalent to 5 + 5 5 + 5 Enter (5+5)(5+5) and press the ENTER key to produce the output shown in the second image in Figure 1.9. Figure 1.9: Calculating 5 + 5 5 + 5 . Answer: 1 ! 26 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS The graphing calculator has memory locations available for “storing” values. They are lettered A-Z and appear on the calculator case, in alphabetic order as you move from left to right and down the keyboard. Storing values in these memory locations is an efficient way to evaluate algebraic expressions containing variables. Use the ALPHA key to access these memory locations. You Try It! EXAMPLE 12. Use the graphing calculator to evaluate |a|− |b| at a = −312Use the graphing calculator to evaluate |a− b| at a = −312 and b = −875. and b = −875. Solution. First store −312 in the variable A with the following keystrokes. To select the letter A, press the ALPHA key, then the MATH key, located in the upper left-hand corner of the calculator (see Figure 1.10). (-) 3 1 2 STO! ALPHA A ENTER Next, store −875 in the variable B with the following keystrokes. To select the letter B, press the ALPHA key, then the APPS key. Figure 1.10: Upper half of the TI84. (-) 8 7 5 STO! ALPHA B ENTER The results of these keystrokes are shown in the first image in Figure 1.11. Now we need to enter the expression |a|− |b|. The absolute value function is located in the MATH menu. When you press the MATH key, you’ll notice submenus MATH, NUM, CPX, and PRB across the top row of the MATH menu. Use the right-arrow key to select the NUM submenu (see the second image in Figure 1.11). Note that abs( is the first entry on this menu. This is the absolute value function needed for this example. Enter the expression abs(A)-abs(B) as shown in the third image in Figure 1.11. Use the ALPHA key as described above to enter the variables A and B and close the parentheses using the right parentheses key from the keyboard. Press the ENTER key to evaluate your expression. Figure 1.11: Evaluate |a|− |b| at a = −312 and b = −875. Thus, |a|− |b| = −563.Answer: 563 ! 1.2. ORDER OF OPERATIONS 27 ! ! !
