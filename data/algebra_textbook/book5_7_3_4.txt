Dividing a Polynomial by a Monomial We know that multiplication is distributive with respect to addition; that is, a(b+ c) = ab+ ac. We use this property to perform multiplications such as: x2(2x2 − 3x− 8) = 2x4 − 3x3 − 8x2 However, it is also true that division is distributive with respect to addition. Distributive property for division. If a, b, and c are any numbers, then: a+ b c = a c + b c 512 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS For example, note that 4 + 6 2 = 4 2 + 6 2 . This form of the distributive property can be used to divide a polynomial by a monomial. You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Divide x2 − 2x− 3 by x2.Divide 9x3 + 8x2 − 6x by 3x2. Solution: We use the distributive property, dividing each term by x2. x2 − 2x− 3 x2 = x2 x2 − 2x x2 − 3 x2 Now we reduce each term of the last result to lowest terms, canceling common factors. = 1− 2 x − 3 x2 Answer: 3x+ 8 3 − 2 x ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Divide 2x3 − 3x+ 12 by 6x3.Divide −4x2 + 6x− 9 by 2x4. Solution: We use the distributive property, dividing each term by 6x3. 2x3 − 3x+ 12 6x3 = 2x3 6x3 − 3x 6x3 + 12 6x3 Now we reduce each term of the last result to lowest terms, canceling common factors. = 1 3 − 1 2x2 + 2 x3 Answer: − 2 x2 + 3 x3 − 9 x4 ! 7.3.
