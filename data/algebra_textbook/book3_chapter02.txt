 ||  || Constants ·        Fixed values, like 2 or 7. ·        Can also be represented by letters: a, b, c, p, e, k  || Terms Terms are Separated by + or –  || Factors Factors are multiplied together.  || Coefficients Coefficients are constant factors that multiply a variable or powers of a variable The middle term has 2 factors, –3 and x. We say that the coefficient of x is –3. The first term has three factors, 2 and two factors of x. We say that 2 is the coefficient of x2. The last term is a factor all by itself (although the number 4 could be factored into 2 × 2).  ||  || Combining Like terms Combining like terms is permitted because of the distributive law. For example, 3x2 + 5x2 = (3 + 5)x2 = 8x2 What happened here is that the distributive law was used in reverse—we “undistributed” a common factor of x2 from each term. The way to think about this operation is that if you have three x-squareds, and then you get five more x-squareds, you will then have eight x-squareds. Example:  x2 + 2x + 3x2 + 2 + 4x + 7 Starting with the highest power of x, we see that there are four x-squareds in all (1x2 + 3x2). Then we collect the first powers of x, and see that there are six of them (2x + 4x). The only thing left is the constants 2 + 7 = 9. Putting this all together we get x2 + 2x + 3x2 + 2 + 4x + 7 = 4x2 + 6x + 9  || Parentheses ·        Parentheses must be multiplied out before collecting like terms You cannot combine things in parentheses (or other grouping symbols) with things outside the parentheses. Think of parentheses as opaque—the stuff inside the parentheses can’t “see” the stuff outside the parentheses. If there is some factor multiplying the parentheses, then the only way to get rid of the parentheses is to multiply using the distributive law. Example:  3x + 2(x – 4) = 3x + 2x – 8 = 5x – 8  || Minus Signs: Subtraction and Negatives Subtraction can be replaced by adding the opposite 3x – 2 = 3x + (–2) Negative signs in front of parentheses A special case is when a minus sign appears in front of parentheses. At first glance, it looks as though there is no factor multiplying the parentheses, and you may be tempted to just remove the parentheses. What you need to remember is that the minus sign indicating subtraction should always be thought of as adding the opposite. This means that you want to add the opposite of the entire thing inside the parentheses, and so you have to change the sign of each term in the parentheses. Another way of looking at it is to imagine an implied factor of one in front of the parentheses. Then the minus sign makes that factor into a negative one, which can be multiplied by the distributive law: 3x – (2 – x) = 3x + (–1)[2 + (–x)] = 3x + (–1)(2) + (–1)(–x) = 3x – 2 + x = 4x – 2 However, if there is only a plus sign in front of the parentheses, then you can simply erase the parentheses: 3x + (2 – x) = 3x + 2 – x A comment about subtraction and minus signs Although you can always explicitly replace subtraction with adding the opposite, as in this previous example, it is often tedious and inconvenient to do so. Once you get used to thinking that way, it is no longer necessary to actually write it that way. It is helpful to always think of minus signs as being “stuck” to the term directly to their right. That way, as you rearrange terms, collect like terms, and clear parentheses, the “adding the opposite” business will be taken care of because the minus signs will go with whatever was to their right. If what is immediately to the right of a minus sign happens to be a parenthesis, then the minus sign attacks every term inside the parentheses.  || Up until now, we have just been talking about manipulating algebraic expressions. Now it is time to talk about equations. An expression is just a statement like2x + 3This expression might be equal to any number, depending on the choice of x. For example, if x = 3 then the value of this expression is 9. But if we are writing an equation, then we are making a statement about its value. We might say2x + 3 = 7A mathematical equation is either true or false. This equation, 2x + 3 = 7, might be true or it might be false; it depends on the value chosen for x. We call such equations conditional, because their truth depends on choosing the correct value for x. If I choose x = 3, then the equation is clearly false because 2(3) + 3 = 9, not 7. In fact, it is only true if I choose x = 2. Any other value for x produces a false equation. We say that x = 2 is the solution of this equation.Solutions The solution of an equation is the value(s) of the variable(s) that make the equation a true statement. An equation like 2x + 3 = 7 is a simple type called a linear equation in one variable. These will always have one solution, no solutions, or an infinite number of solutions. There are other types of equations, however, that can have several solutions. For example, the equation x2 = 9 is satisfied by both 3 and –3, and so it has two solutions. One Solution This is the normal case, as in our example where the equation 2x + 3 = 7 had exactly one solution, namely x = 2. The other two cases, no solution and an infinite number of solutions, are the oddball cases that you don’t expect to run into very often. Nevertheless, it is important to know that they can happen in case you do encounter one of these situations. Infinite Number of Solutions Consider the equation x = x This equation is obviously true for every possible value of x. This is, of course, a ridiculously simple example, but it makes the point. Equations that have this property are called identities. Some examples of identities would be   2x = x + x 3 = 3 (x – 2)(x + 2) = x2 – 4   All of these equations are true for any value of x. The second example, 3 = 3, is interesting because it does not even contain an x, so obviously its truthfulness cannot depend on the value of x! When you are attempting to solve an equation algebraically and you end up with an obvious identity (like 3 = 3), then you know that the original equation must also be an identity, and therefore it has an infinite number of solutions. No Solutions Now consider the equation x + 4 = x + 3 There is no possible value for x that could make this true. If you take a number and add 4 to it, it will never be the same as if you take the same number and add 3 to it. Such an equation is called a contradiction, because it cannot ever be true. If you are attempting to solve such an equation, you will end up with an extremely obvious contradiction such as 1 = 2. This indicates that the original equation is a contradiction, and has no solution.  In summary, o        An identity is always true, no matter what x is o        A contradiction is never true for any value of x o        A conditional equation is true for some values of x ||  || The Addition Principle ·        Adding (or subtracting) the same number to both sides of an equation does not change its solution set. Think of the balance analogy—if both sides of the equation are equal, then increasing both sides by the same amount will change the value of each side, but they will still be equal. For example, if 3 = 3, then 3 + 2 = 3 + 2.   Consequently, if   6 + x = 8   for some value of x (which in this case is x = 2), then we can add any number to both sides of the equation and x = 2 will still be the solution. If we wanted to, we could add a 3 to both sides of the equation, producing the equation   9 + x = 11.   As you can see, x = 2 is still the solution. Of course, this new equation is no simpler than the one we started with, and this maneuver did not help us solve the equation. If we want to solve the equation   6 + x = 8,   the idea is to get x by itself on one side, and so we want to get rid of the 6 that is on the left side. We can do this by subtracting a 6 from both sides of the equation (which of course can be thought of as adding a negative six):   6 – 6 + x = 8 – 6 or x = 2   You can think of this operation as moving the 6 from one side of the equation to the other, which causes it to change sign   ·        The addition principle is useful in solving equations because it allows us to move whole terms from one side of the equal sign to the other. While this is a convenient way to think of it, you should remember that you are not really “moving” the term from one side to the other—you are really adding (or subtracting) the term on both sides of the equation.  || Notation notes In the previous example, we wrote the –6 in-line with the rest of the equation. This is analogous to writing an arithmetic subtraction problem in one line, as in   234 – 56 = 178.   You probably also learned to write subtraction and addition problems in a column format, like We can also use a similar notation for the addition method with algebraic equations. Given the equation   x + 3 = 2, we want to subtract a 3 from both sides in order to isolate the variable. In column format this would look like Here the numbers in the second row are negative 3’s, so we are adding the two rows together to produce the bottom row. The advantage of the column notation is that it makes the operation easier to see and reduces the chances for an error. The disadvantage is that it takes more space, but that is a relatively minor disadvantage. Which notation you prefer to use is not important, as long as you can follow what you are doing and it makes sense to you.  || Multiplying (or dividing) the same non-zero number to both sides of an equation does not change its solution set.Example:so if 6x = 12, then 18x = 36 for the same value of x (which in this case is x = 2).The way we use the multiplication principle to solve equations is that it allows us to isolate the variable by getting rid of a factor that is multiplying the variable.Example:  2x = 6To get rid of the 2 that is multiplying the x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2, or multiply by its reciprocal (one-half).Either divide both sides by 2: or multiply both sides by a half:Whether you prefer to think of it as dividing by the number or multiplying by its reciprocal is not important, although when the coefficient is a fraction it is easier to multiply by the reciprocal:  Example:  Multiply both sides by the reciprocal of the coefficient, or   || Suppose you were given an equation like 2x – 3 = 5. You will need to use the addition principle to move the –3, and the multiplication principle to remove the coefficient 2. Which one should you use first? Strictly speaking, it does not matter—you will eventually get the right answer. In practice, however, it is usually simpler to use the addition principle first, and then the multiplication principle. The reason for this is that if we divide by 2 first we will turn everything into fractions: Given: 2x – 3 = 5 Suppose we first divide both sides by 2: Now there is nothing wrong with doing arithmetic with fractions, but it is not as simple as working with whole numbers. In this example we would have to add 3/2 to both sides of the equation to isolate the x. It is usually more convenient, though, to use the addition principle first: Given: 2x – 3 = 5 Add 3 to both sides:    At this point all we need to do is divide both sides by 2 to get x = 4. ||
