Division with a Remainder We might wonder how many times 4 is contained in 10. Repeated subtraction yields Since the remainder is less than 4, we stop the subtraction. Thus, 4 goes into 10 two times with 2 remaining. We can write this as a division as follows. Since 4 does not divide into 2 (the remainder is less than the divisor) and there are no digits to bring down to continue the process, we are done. We write or Sample Set C Example 2.27.  Find 85÷3. There are no more digits to bring down to continue the process. We are done. One is the remainder. Check: Multiply 28 and 3, then add 1. Thus, . Example 2.28.  Find 726÷23. Check: Multiply 31 by 23, then add 13. Thus, 726÷23 = 31R13. Practice Set C Perform the following divisions. Exercise 2.4.10. (Go to Solution) 75÷4 Exercise 2.4.11.
