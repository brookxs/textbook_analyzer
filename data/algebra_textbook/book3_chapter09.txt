 ||  || Roots Synonyms: Solutions or Zeros  Can have 0, 1, or 2 real roots Consider the graph of quadratic equations. The quadratic equation looks like ax2 + bx + c = 0, but if we take the quadratic expression on the left and set it equal to y, we will have a function: y = ax2 + bx + c When we graph y vs. x, we find that we get a curve called a parabola. The specific values of a, b, and c control where the curve is relative to the origin (left, right, up, or down), and how rapidly it spreads out. Also, if a is negative then the parabola will be upside-down. What does this have to do with finding the solutions to our original quadratic equation? Well, whenever y = 0 then the equation y = ax2 + bx + c is the same as our original equation. Graphically, y is zero whenever the curve crosses the x-axis. Thus, the solutions to the original quadratic equation (ax2 + bx + c = 0) are the values of x where the function (y = ax2 + bx + c) crosses the x-axis. From the figures below, you can see that it can cross the x-axis once, twice, or not at all.    Actually, if you have a graphing calculator this technique can be used to find solutions to any equation, not just quadratics. All you need to do is   Move all the terms to one side, so that it is equal to zero Set the resulting expression equal to y (in place of zero) Enter the function into your calculator and graph it Look for places where the graph crosses the x-axis   Your graphing calculator most likely has a function that will automatically find these intercepts and give you the x-values with great precision. Of course, no matter how many decimal places you have it is still just an approximation of the exact solution. In real life, though, a close approximation is often good enough.  || No First-Degree Term If the quadratic has no linear, or first-degree term (i.e. b = 0), then it can be solved by isolating the x2 and taking square roots of both sides: You need both the positive and negative roots because , so x could be either positive or negative. This is only going to give a real solution if either a or c is negative (but not both) ||  || Trinomials When a quadratic has all three terms, you can still solve it with the zero-product rule if you are able to factor the trinomial. ·                     Remember, not all trinomial quadratics can be factored with integer constants If it can be factored, then it can be written as a product of two binomials. The zero-product rule can then be used to set each of these factors equal to zero, resulting in two equations that are both simple linear equations that can be solved for x. See the above example for the zero-product rule to see how this works. A more thorough discussion of factoring trinomials may be found in the chapter on polynomials, but here is a quick review:  || Tips for Factoring Trinomials 1.                  Clear fractions (by multiplying through by the common denominator) 2.                  Remove common factors if possible 3.                  If the coefficient of the x2 term is 1, then x2 + bx + c = (x + n)(x + m), where n and m                                              i.      Multiply to give c                                            ii.      Add to give b 4.                  If the coefficient of the x2 term is not 1, then use either a.       Guess-and Check                                                    i.      List the factors of the coefficient of the x2 term                                                  ii.      List the factors of the constant term                                                 iii.      Test all the possible binomials you can make from these factors b.      Factoring by Grouping                                                    i.      Find the product ac                                                  ii.      Find two factors of ac that add to give b                                                 iii.      Split the middle term into the sum of two terms, using these two factors                                                iv.      Group the terms into pairs                                                 v.      Factor out the common binomial    ||  || If the Coefficient of x2 is Not 1 First divide through by the coefficient, then proceed with completing the square. Example:   Given Equation: Divide through by coefficient of x2: (in this case a 2) Move constant to other side: Add new constant term: (the square of half the coefficient of x, in this case 9/16): Write as a binomial squared: (the constant in the binomial is half the coefficient of x) Square root both sides: (remember to use plus-or-minus) Solve for x:                  Thus               x = ½  or  x = -2  ||  || Deriving the Quadratic Formula The quadratic formula can be derived by using the technique of completing the square on the general quadratic formula: Given: Divide through by a: Move the constant term to the right side: Add the square of one-half the coefficient of x to both sides: Factor the left side (which is now a perfect square), and rearrange the right side: Get the right side over a common denominator: Take the square root of both sides (remembering to use plus-or-minus): Solve for x:  ||
