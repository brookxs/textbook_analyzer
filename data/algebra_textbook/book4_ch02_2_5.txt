The Multiplication Process With a Single Digit Multiplier Since multiplication is repeated addition, we should not be surprised to notice that carrying can occur. Carrying occurs when we find the product of 38 and 7: First, we compute 7 × 8 = 56. Write the 6 in the ones column. Carry the 5. Then take 7 × 3 = 21. Add to 21 the 5 that was carried: 21 + 5 = 26. The product is 266. Sample Set B Find the following products. Example 2.3.  The product is 192. Example 2.4.  The product is 2,630. Example 2.5.  The product is 16,236. Practice Set B Find the following products. Exercise 2.2.5. (Go to Solution) Exercise 2.2.6. (Go to Solution) Exercise 2.2.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 2.2.8. (Go to Solution) Exercise 2.2.9.
