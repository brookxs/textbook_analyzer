Clearing Negative Exponents Often, we’re asked to provide a final answer that is free of negative exponents. It is common to hear the instruction “no negative exponents in the final an- swer.” Let’s explore a couple of techniques that allow us to clear our answer of negative exponents. 486 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Consider the expression:Simplify the expression y5 x−2 so that the resulting equivalent expression contains no negative exponents. x2 y−3 Simplify so that the resulting equivalent expression contains no negative expo- nents. Solution: Raising y to the −3 means we have to cube and invert, so y−3 = 1/y3. x2 y−3 = x2 1 y3 To divide x2 by 1/y3, we invert and multiply. = x2 ÷ 1 y3 = x2 1 · y 3 1 = x2y3 Alternate approach: An alternate approach takes advantage of the laws of exponents. We begin by multiplying numerator and denominator by y3. x2 y−3 = x2 y−3 · y 3 y3 = x2y3 y0 = x2y3 In the last step, note how we used the fact that y0 = 1.Answer: y5x2 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Consider the expression:Simplify the expression x−3y2 3z−4 so that the resulting equivalent expression contains no negative exponents. 2x2y−2 z3 Simplify so that the resulting equivalent expression contains no negative expo- nents. 7.1. NEGATIVE EXPONENTS 487 Solution: Again, we can remove all the negative exponents by taking recip- rocals. In this case y−2 = 1/y2 (square and invert). 2x2y−2 z3 = 2x2 · 1 y2 z3 = 2x2 y2 z3 To divide 2x2/y2 by z3, we invert and multiply. = 2x2 y2 ÷ z3 = 2x2 y2 · 1 z3 = 2x2 y2z3 Alternate approach: An alternate approach again takes advantage of the laws of exponents. We begin by multiplying numerator and denominator by y2. 2x2y−2 z3 = 2x2y−2 z3 · y 2 y2 = 2x2y0 y2z3 = 2x2 y2z3 In the last step, note how we used the fact that y0 = 1. Answer: y2z4 3x3 ! 488 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS ! ! ! Clearing Negative Exponents Often, we’re asked to provide a final answer that is free of negative exponents.
