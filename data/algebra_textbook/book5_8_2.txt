8.2 Simplifying Radical Expressions Let’s begin by comparing two mathematical expressions. √ 9 √ 16 = 3 · 4 = 12 √ 9 · 16 = √144 = 12 Note that both √ 9 √ 16 and √ 9 · 16 equal 12. Hence, √9√16 = √9 · 16. Let’s look at another example. √ 4 √ 9 = 2 · 3 = 6 √ 4 · 9 = √36 = 6 Note that both √ 4 √ 9 and √ 4 · 9 equal 6. Hence, √4√9 = √4 · 9. It appears that a pattern is forming, namely: √ a √ b = √ ab Let’s try an example on our calculator. First enter √ 2 √ 3, then enter √ 2 · 3 (see Figure 8.7). Note that they produce the same result. Therefore, √ 2 √ 3 =√ 2 · 3. Figure 8.7: Note that √ 2 √ 3 = √ 2 · 3. The above discussion leads us to the following result. Multiplication property of radicals.

For example: √ 50 = √ 25 √ 2 Factor out a perfect square. = 5 √ 2 Simplify: √ 25 = 5. The expression 5 √ 2 is said to be in simple radical form. Like reducing a fraction to lowest terms, you should always look to factor out a perfect square when possible. Simple radical form. If possible, always factor out a perfect square. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Place √ 8 in simple radical form.Place √ 12 in simple radical form. Solution: From √ 8, we can factor out a perfect square, in this case √ 4. √ 8 = √ 4 √ 2 Factor out a perfect square. = 2 √ 2 Simplify: √ 4 = 2. Answer: 2 √ 3 ! Sometimes, after factoring out a perfect square, you can still factor out another perfect square. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Place √ 72 in simple radical form.Place √ 200 in simple radical form. Solution: From √ 72, we can factor out a perfect square, in this case √ 9. √ 72 = √ 9 √ 8 Factor out a perfect square. = 3 √ 8 Simplify: √ 9 = 3. 8.2. SIMPLIFYING RADICAL EXPRESSIONS 549 However, from √ 8 we can factor out another perfect square, in this case √ 4. = 3 √ 4 √ 2 Factor out another perfect square. = 3 · 2 ·√2 Simplify: √4 = 2. = 6 √ 2 Multiply: 3 · 2 = 6. Alternate solution. We can simplify the process by noting that we can factor out √ 36 from √ 72 to start the process. √ 72 = √ 36 √ 2 Factor out a perfect square. = 6 √ 2 Simplify: √ 36 = 6. Although the second solution is more efficient, the first solution is still math- ematically correct. The point to make here is that we must continue to factor out a perfect square whenever possible. Our answer is not in simple radical form until we can no longer factor out a perfect square. Answer: 10 √ 2 !  || The Pythagorean Theorem An angle that measures 90 degrees is called a right angle. If one of the angles of a triangle is a right angle, then the triangle is called a right triangle. It is traditional to mark the right angle with a little square (see Figure 8.8). A B Cb a c Figure 8.8: Right triangle &ABC has a right angle at vertex C. Right triangle terminology. • The longest side of the right triangle, the side directly opposite the right angle, is called the hypotenuse of the right triangle. • The remaining two sides of the right triangle are called the legs of the right triangle. 550 CHAPTER 8. QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS  || Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem Each side of the square in Figure 8.9 has been divided into two segments, one of length a, the other of length b. a b a b ab a b c c c c Figure 8.9: Proving the Pythagorean Theorem. We can find the total area of the square by squaring any one of the sides of the square. A = (a+ b)2 Square a side to find area. A = a2 + 2ab+ b2 Squaring a binomial pattern. Thus, the total area of the square is A = a2 + 2ab+ b2. A second approach to finding the area of the square is to sum the areas of the geometric parts that make up the square. We have four congruent right triangles, shaded in light red, with base a and height b. The area of each of these triangles is found by taking one-half times the base times the height; i.e., the area of each triangles is (1/2)ab. In the interior, we have a smaller square with side c. Its area is found by squaring its side; i.e., the area of the smaller square is c2. The total area of the square is the sum of its parts, one smaller square and four congruent triangles. That is: A = c2 + 4 ( 1 2 ab ) Adding the area of the interior square and the area of four right triangles. A = c2 + 2ab Simplify: 4((1/2)ab) = 2ab. The two expressions, a2 + 2ab+ b2 and c2 + 2ab, both represent the total area of the large square. Hence, they must be equal to one another. a2 + 2ab+ b2 = c2 + 2ab Each side of this equation represents the area of the large square. a2 + b2 = c2 Subtract 2ab from both sides. 8.2. SIMPLIFYING RADICAL EXPRESSIONS 551 The last equation, a2 + b2 = c2, is called the Pythagorean Theorem. The Pythagorean Theorem. If a and b are the legs of a right triangle and c is its hypotenuse, then: a2 + b2 = c2 We say “The sum of the squares of the legs of a right triangle equals the square of its hypotenuse.” Good hint. Note that the hypotenuse sits by itself on one side of the equation a2 + b2 = c2. The legs of the hypotenuse are on the other side. Let’s put the Pythagorean Theorem to work. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Find the length of the missing side of the right triangle shown Find the missing side of the right triangle shown below. 5 12 c below. 4 3 c Solution: First, write out the Pythagorean Theorem, then substitute the given values in the appropriate places. a2 + b2 = c2 Pythagorean Theorem. (4)2 + (3)2 = c2 Substitute: 4 for a, 3 for b. 16 + 9 = c2 Square: (4)2 = 16, (3)2 = 9. 25 = c2 Add: 16 + 9 = 25. The equation c2 = 25 has two real solutions, c = −5 and c = 5. However, in this situation, c represents the length of the hypotenuse and must be a positive number. Hence: c = 5 Nonnegative square root. Thus, the length of the hypotenuse is 5. Answer: 13 ! 552 CHAPTER 8. QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. An isosceles right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 8. FindAn isosceles right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 10. Find the lengths of the legs. the lengths of the legs. Solution: In general, an isosceles triangle is a triangle with two equal sides. In this case, an isosceles right triangle has two equal legs. We’ll let x represent the length of each leg. 8 x x Use the Pythagorean Theorem, substituting x for each leg and 8 for the hy- potenuse. a2 + b2 = c2 Pythagorean Theorem. x2 + x2 = 82 Substitute: x for a, x for b, 8 for c. 2x2 = 64 Combine like terms: x+ x = 2x. x2 = 32 Divide both sides by 2. The equation x2 = 32 has two real solutions, x = −√32 and x = √32. How- ever, in this situation, x represents the length of each leg and must be a positive number. Hence: x = √ 32 Nonnegative square root. Remember, your final answer must be in simple radical form. We must factor out a perfect square when possible. x = √ 16 √ 2 Factor out a perfect square. x = 4 √ 2 Simplify: √ 16 = 4. Thus, the length of each leg is 4 √ 2.Answer: Each leg has length 5 √ 2. ! 8.2. SIMPLIFYING RADICAL EXPRESSIONS 553  ||
