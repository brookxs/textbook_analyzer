Decimals In this section, we provide a brief review of the decimal system. A real number in decimal form, a decimal A real number expressed using the decimal system. consists of a decimal point, digits (0 through 9) to the left of the decimal point representing the whole number part, and digits to the right of the decimal point representing the fractional part. The digits represent powers of 10 as shown in the set {…, 1,000, 100, 10, 1, 1/10, 1/100, 1/1,000, …} according to the following diagram: For example, the decimal 538.3 can be written in the following expanded form: After simplifying, we obtain the mixed number 538 3 10 . Use this process to convert decimals to mixed numbers.   Example 1: Write as a mixed number: 32.15. Solution: In this example, 32 is the whole part and the decimal ends in the hundredths place. Therefore, the fractional part will be 15/100, and we can write Answer: 32.15 = 32 3 20   To convert fractions to decimal equivalents, divide.   Example 2: Write as a decimal: 3 4 . Solution: Use long division to convert to a decimal. Answer: 3 4 = 0.75   If the division never ends, then use a bar over the repeating digit (or block of digits) to indicate a repeating decimal.   Example 3: Write as a decimal: 2 5 6 . Solution: Use long division to convert the fractional part to a decimal and then add the whole part. At this point, we can see that the long division will continue to repeat. When this is the case, use a bar over the repeating digit to indicate that it continues forever: Then write Answer: 2 5 6 = 2.8 3 ¯   To add or subtract decimals, align them vertically with the decimal point and add corresponding place values. Recall that sometimes you need to borrow from or carry over to the adjoining column (regrouping).   Example 4: Subtract: 54.328 − 23.25 . Solution: Note that trailing zeros to the right of the decimal point do not change the value of the decimal, 23.25 = 23.250. In this case, you need to borrow from the tenths place (regroup) to subtract the digits in the hundredths place. Answer: 31.078   Multiply decimals the same way you multiply whole numbers. The number of decimal places in the product will be the sum of the decimal places found in each of the factors.   Example 5: Multiply: 5.36 × 7.4 . Solution: The total number of decimal places of the two factors is 2 + 1 = 3. Therefore, the result has 3 decimal places. Answer: 39.664   When dividing decimals, move the decimal points of both the dividend and the divisor so that the divisor is a whole number. Remember to move the decimal the same number of places for both the dividend and divisor.   Example 6: Divide: 33.3216 ÷ 6.24 . Solution: Move the decimal point to turn the divisor into a whole number: 624. Move the decimal points of both the divisor and dividend two places to the right. Next, divide. Answer: 5.34   It is often necessary to round off A means of approximating decimals with a specified number of significant digits. decimals to a specified number of decimal places. Rounding off allows us to approximate decimals with fewer significant digits. To do this, look at the digit to the right of the specified place value. If the digit to the right of the specified place is 4 or less, then leave the specified digit unchanged and drop all subsequent digits. If the digit to the right of the specified place is 5 or greater, then increase the value of the digit in the specified place by 1 and drop all subsequent digits. Recall that decimals with trailing zeros to the right of the decimal point can be dropped. For example, round 5.635457 to the nearest thousandth: Round the same number 5.635457 to the nearest hundredth: After rounding off, be sure to use the appropriate notation ( ≈ ) to indicate that the number is now an approximation. When working with US currency, we typically round off to two decimal places, or the nearest hundredth.   Example 7: Calculate and round off to the nearest hundredth. a. 1/3 of $10.25. b. 1/4 of $10.25. Solution: In this context, the key word “of” indicates that we should multiply. a. Multiplying by 1 3 is equivalent to dividing by 3. b. Multiplying by 1 4 is equivalent to dividing by 4. Answers: a. $3.42; b. $2.56 Decimals In this section, we provide a brief review of the decimal system.
