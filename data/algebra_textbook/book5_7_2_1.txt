Multiplying Decimal Numbers by Powers of Ten Let’s multiply 1.234567 by 103, or equivalently, by 1,000. 1.234567 ×1000 1234.567000 The sum total of digits to the right of the decimal point in 1.234567 and 1000 is 6. Therefore, we place the decimal point in the product so that there are six digits to the right of the decimal point. However, the trailing zeros may be removed without changing the value of the product. That is, 1.234567 times 1000 is 1234.567. Note that the decimal point in the product is three places further to the right than in the original factor. This observation leads to the following result. Multiplying by a nonnegative power of ten. Multiplying a decimal num- ber by 10n, where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , will move the decimal point n places to the right. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify: 325.6783× 102. Simplify: 23.57889× 103 Solution. Multiplying by 102 will move the decimal point two places to the right. Thus: 325.6783× 102 = 32, 567.83 Answer: 23, 578.89 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify: 1.25× 105. Simplify: 2.35× 104 494 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS Solution. Multiplying by 105 will move the decimal point two places to the right. In this case, we need to add zeros at the end of the number to accomplish moving the decimal 5 places to the right. 1.25× 105 = 125, 000 Answer: 23, 500 ! Let’s multiply 453.9 by 10−2, or equivalently, by 0.01. 453.9 ×0.01 4.539 The sum total of digits to the right of the decimal point in 453.9 and 0.01 is 3. Therefore, we place the decimal point in the product so that there are 3 digits to the right of the decimal point. That is, 453.9 × 10−2 = 4.539. Note that the decimal point in the product is two places further to the left than in the original factor. This observation leads to the following result. Multiplying by a negative power of ten. Multiplying a decimal number by 10−n, where n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , will move the decimal point n places to the left. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify: 14, 567.8× 10−3.Simplify: 3, 854.2× 10−1 Solution. Multiplying by 10−3 will move the decimal point three places to the left. Thus: 14, 567.8× 10−3 = 14.5678Answer: 385.42 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Simplify: 4.3× 10−4.Simplify: 2.2× 10−2 Solution. Multiplying by 10−4 will move the decimal point four places to the left. In this case, we need to add some leading zeros at the beginning of the number to accomplish moving the decimal 4 places to the left. 4.3× 10−4 = 0.00043 Note also the leading zero before the decimal point. Although .00043 is an equivalent number, the form 0.00043 is preferred in mathematics and science.Answer: 0.022 ! 7.2.
