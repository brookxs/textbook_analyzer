Coefficients Coefficients are constant factors that multiply a variable or powers of a variable The middle term has 2 factors, –3 and x. We say that the coefficient of x is –3. The first term has three factors, 2 and two factors of x. We say that 2 is the coefficient of x2. The last term is a factor all by itself (although the number 4 could be factored into 2 × 2).
