Definitions A polynomial An algebraic expression consisting of terms with real number coefficients and variables with whole number exponents. is a special algebraic expression with terms that consist of real number coefficients and variable factors with whole number exponents. Polynomials do not have variables in the denominator of any term. The degree of a term The exponent of the variable; if there is more than one variable in the term, the degree of the term is the sum their exponents. in a polynomial is defined to be the exponent of the variable, or if there is more than one variable in the term, the degree is the sum of their exponents. Recall that x 0 = 1 ; any constant term can be written as a product of x 0 and itself. Hence the degree of a constant term is 0. Term Degree 3 x 2 2 6 x 2 y 2 + 1 = 3 7 a 2 b 3 2 + 3 = 5 8 0 , since 8 = 8 x 0 2 x 1, since x = x 1 The degree of a polynomial The largest degree of all of its terms. is the largest degree of all of its terms.

The highest variable exponent is 5. Therefore, this is a trinomial of degree 5. Answer: Trinomial; degree 5   Example 2: Classify and state the degree: 12 a 5 b c 3 . Solution: Since the expression consists of only multiplication, it is one term, a monomial. The variable part can be written as a 5 b 1 c 3 ; hence its degree is 5 + 1 + 3 = 9 . Answer: Monomial; degree 9   Example 3: Classify and state the degree: 4 x 2 y − 6 x y 4 + 5 x 3 y 3 + 4 . Solution: The term 4 x 2 y has degree 3; − 6 x y 4 has degree 5; 5 x 3 y 3 has degree 6; and the constant term 4 has degree 0. Therefore, the polynomial has 4 terms with degree 6. Answer: Polynomial; degree 6   Of particular interest are polynomials with one variable A polynomial where each term has the form a n x n , where a n is any real number and n is any whole number. , where each term is of the form a n x n . Here a n is any real number and n is any whole number. Such polynomials have the standard form Typically, we arrange terms of polynomials in descending order based on the degree of each term.

Solution: Since terms are separated by addition, write the following: In this form, we can see that the subtraction in the original corresponds to negative coefficients. Because addition is commutative, we can write the terms in descending order based on the degree of each term as follows: Answer: − 2 x 4 + 5 x 3 − 4 x 2 + 3 x + 7   We can further classify polynomials with one variable by their degree as follows: Polynomial Name 5 Constant (degree 0) 2 x + 1 Linear (degree 1) 3 x 2 + 5 x − 3 Quadratic (degree 2) x 3 + x 2 + x + 1 Cubic (degree 3) 7 x 4 + 3 x 3 − 7 x + 8 Fourth-degree polynomial In this text, we call any polynomial of degree n ≥ 4 an nth-degree polynomial. In other words, if the degree is 4, we call the polynomial a fourth-degree polynomial. If the degree is 5, we call it a fifth-degree polynomial, and so on.
