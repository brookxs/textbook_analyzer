The Associative Property of Addition Associative Property of Addition If three whole numbers are to be added, the sum will be the same if the first two are added first, then that sum is added to the third, or, the second two are added first, and that sum is added to the first. Using Parentheses It is a common mathematical practice to use parentheses to show which pair of numbers we wish to combine first. Sample Set B Example 1.49.  Add the whole numbers. Practice Set B Exercise 1.7.3. (Go to Solution) Use the associative property of addition to add the following whole numbers two different ways. Exercise 1.7.4.
