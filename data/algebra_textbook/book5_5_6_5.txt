Some Applications Recall that the area of a circle of radius r is found using the formula A = pir2. The circumference (distance around) of a circle of radius r is found using the formula C = 2pir (see Figure 5.37). r A = pir2 C = 2pir Figure 5.37: Formulae for the area and circumference of a circle of radius r.

MULTIPLYING POLYNOMIALS 363 Solution: We can find the area of the shaded region by subtracting the area of the inner circle from the area of the outer circle. A = Area of outer circle−Area of inner circle We use the formula A = pir2 to compute the area of each circle. Because the outer circle has radius x+1, it has area pi(x+1)2. Because the inner circle has radius x, it has area pix2. = pi(x+ 1)2 − pix2 Next, we’ll expand (x+ 1)2, then combine like terms. = pi(x+ 1)(x+ 1)− pix2 = pi(x2 + x+ x+ 1)− pix2 = pi(x2 + 2x+ 1)− pix2 Finally, distribute pi times each term of x2 + 2x+ 1, then combine like terms. = pix2 + 2pix+ pi − pix2 = 2pix+ pi Hence, the area of the shaded region is A = 2pix+ pi.

The demand for widgets is a function of the unit price, Suppose that the demand for gadgets is given by the function x = 320− 1.5p, where x is the demand and p is the unit price. Use the graphing calculator to determine the unit price a retailer should charge for gadgets so that her revenue from sales equals $12,000. where the demand is the number of widgets the public will buy and the unit price is the amount charged for a single widget. Suppose that the demand is given by the function x = 270− 0.75p, where x is the demand and p is the unit price. Note how the demand decreases as the unit price goes up (makes sense). Use the graphing calculator to determine the unit price a retailer should charge for widgets so that his revenue from sales equals $20,000. Solution: To determine the revenue (R), you multiply the number of widgets sold (x) by the unit price (p). R = xp (5.5) However, we know that the number of units sold is the demand, given by the formula x = 270− 0.75p (5.6) Substitute equation 5.6 into equation 5.5 to obtain the revenue as a function of the unit price.
