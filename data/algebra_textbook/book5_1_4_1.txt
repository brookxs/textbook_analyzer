Adding and Subtracting Decimals When adding signed decimals, use the same rules you learned to use when adding signed integers or fractions. Sign rules for addition. When adding two decimal numbers, use the follow- ing rules: • To add two decimals with like signs, add their magnitudes and prefix their common sign. 50 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS • To add two decimals with unlike signs, subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger, then prefix the sign of the decimal number having the larger magnitude. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify: (a) −2.3 + (−0.015) and (b) −8.4 + 6.95Simplify: −22.6 + 18.47 Solution: In part (a), note that we have like signs. Hence, we add the mag- nitudes and prefix the common sign. −2.3 + (−0.015) = −2.315 2.300 +0.015 2.315 In part (b), note that we have unlike signs. Thus, we first subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger magnitude, then prefix the sign of the decimal num- ber with the larger magnitude. −8.4 + 6.95 = −1.45 8.40 −6.95 1.45 Hence, −2.3 + (−0.015) = −2.315 and −8.4 + 6.95 = −1.45.Answer: −4.13 ! Subtraction still means “add the opposite.” You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify: (a) −5.6− 8.4 and (b) −7.9− (−5.32)Simplify: −22.6− 18.47 Solution: In part (a), first we add the oppposite. Then we note that we have like signs. Hence, we add the magnitudes and prefix the common sign. −5.6− 8.4 = −5.6 + (−8.4) = −14.0 5.6 +8.4 14.0 In part (b), first we add the opposite. Then we note that we have unlike signs. Thus, we first subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger magnitude, then prefix the sign of the decimal number with the larger magnitude. −7.9− (−5.32) = −7.9 + 5.32 = −2.58 7.90 −5.32 2.58 Hence, −5.6− 8.4 = −14.0 and −7.9− (−5.32) = −2.58.Answer: −41.07 ! 1.4.
