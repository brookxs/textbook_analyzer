Algebraic Expressions Algebraic Expression An algebraic expression is a number, a letter, or a collection of numbers and letters along with meaningful signs of operation. Expressions Algebraic expressions are often referred to simply as expressions, as in the following examples: Example 4.1.  x + 4 is an expression. Example 4.2.  7y is an expression. Example 4.3.  is an expression. Example 4.4.  The number 8 is an expression. 8 can be written with explicit signs of operation by writing it as 8 + 0 or 8⋅1 . 3x 2 + 6 = 4x − 1 is not an expression, it is an equation. We will study equations in the next section.
