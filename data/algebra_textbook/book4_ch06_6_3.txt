The Method of Multiplying Decimals Method of Multiplying Decimals To multiply decimals, Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Find the sum of the number of decimal places in the factors. The number of decimal places in the product is the sum found in step 2. Sample Set A Find the following products. Example 6.31.  6.5 ⋅ 4.3 Thus, 6.5⋅4.3 = 27.95. Example 6.32.  23.4⋅1.96 Thus, 23.4⋅1.96 = 45.864. Example 6.33.  Find the product of 0.251 and 0.00113 and round to three decimal places. Now, rounding to three decimal places, we get Practice Set A Find the following products. Exercise 6.6.1. (Go to Solution) 5.3⋅ 8.6 Exercise 6.6.2. (Go to Solution) 2.12⋅ 4.9 Exercise 6.6.3. (Go to Solution) 1.054 ⋅ 0.16 Exercise 6.6.4. (Go to Solution) 0.00031 ⋅ 0.002 Exercise 6.6.5. (Go to Solution) Find the product of 2.33 and 4.01 and round to one decimal place. Exercise 6.6.6. (Go to Solution) 10 ⋅ 5.394 Exercise 6.6.7. (Go to Solution) 100 ⋅ 5.394 Exercise 6.6.8. (Go to Solution) 1000⋅ 5.394 Exercise 6.6.9. (Go to Solution) 10,000 ⋅ 5.394 The Method of Multiplying Decimals Method of Multiplying Decimals To multiply decimals, Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers.
