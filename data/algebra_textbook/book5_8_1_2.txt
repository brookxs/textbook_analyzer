Approximating Square Roots The squares in the “List of Squares” shown in Table 8.1 are called perfect squares. Each is the square of a whole number. But not all numbers are perfect squares. For example, in the case of √ 24, there is no whole number whose square is equal to 24. However, this does not prevent √ 24 from being a perfectly good number. 8.1.

We can use the “List of Squares” to find decimal approximations when the radicand is not a perfect square. You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Estimate √ 24 by guessing. Use a calculator to find a more Estimate: √ 83 accurate result and compare this result with your guess. Solution. From the “List of Squares,” note that 24 lies betwen 16 and 25, so√ 24 will lie between 4 and 5, with √ 24 much closer to 5 than it is to 4. 4 5 √ 16 √ 25 √ 24 4.8 Let’s guess √ 24 ≈ 4.8. As a check, let’s square 4.8. (4.8)2 = (4.8)(4.8) = 23.04 Not quite 24! Clearly, √ 24 must be a little bit bigger than 4.8. Let’s use a scientific calculator to get a better approximation. From our calculator, using the square root button, we find √ 24 ≈ 4.89897948557. 544 CHAPTER 8. QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS Even though this is better than our estimate of 4.8, it is still only an ap- proximation. Our calculator was only capable of providing 11 decimal places. However, the exact decimal representation of √ 24 is an infinite decimal that never terminates and never establishes a pattern of repetition.
