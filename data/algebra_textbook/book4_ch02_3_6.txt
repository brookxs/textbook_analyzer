Division by Zero (Zero as a Divisor: , a ≠ 0) Now we ask, What number, if any, is ? Letting represent a possible quotient, we get Converting to the corresponding multiplication form, we have Since , . But this is absurd. This would mean that , or . A nonzero whole number cannot equal 0! Thus, does not name a number Division by Zero is Undefined Division by zero does not name a number. It is, therefore, undefined.
