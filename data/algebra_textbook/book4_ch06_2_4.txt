Reading Decimal Fractions Reading a Decimal Fraction To read a decimal fraction, Read the whole number part as usual. (If the whole number is less than 1, omit steps 1 and 2.) Read the decimal point as the word "and." Read the number to the right of the decimal point as if it were a whole number. Say the name of the position of the last digit. Sample Set A Read the following numbers. Example 6.1.  6.8 Note Some people read this as "six point eight." This phrasing gets the message across, but technically, "six and eight tenths" is the correct phrasing. Example 6.2.  14.116 Example 6.3.  0.0019 Example 6.4.  81 Eighty-one In this problem, the indication is that any whole number is a decimal fraction. Whole numbers are often called decimal numbers. 81 = 81 . 0 Practice Set A Read the following decimal fractions. Exercise 6.2.1. (Go to Solution) 12.9 Exercise 6.2.2.
