Inversely Proportional In Examples 1, 2, and 3, where one quantity was proportional to a second quantity, you may have noticed that when one quantity increased, the second quantity also increased. Vice-versa, when one quantity decreased, the second quantity also decreased. However, not all real-world situations follow this pattern. There are times when as one quantity increases, the related quantity decreases. For example, consider the situation where you increase the number of workers on a job and note that the time to finish the job decreases. This is an example of a quantity being inversely proportional to a second quantity. Inversely proportional. We say the y is inversely proportional to x if and only if y = k x , where k is a constant called the constant of proportionality. The phrase “y varies inversely as x” is an equivalent way of saying “y in inversely proportional to x.” Here are a few examples that translate the phrase “is inversely proportional to.” • Given that d is inversely proportional to t, we write d = k/t, where k is a constant. 528 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS • Given that y is inversely proportional to the cube of x, we write y = k/x3, where k is a constant. • Given that s is inversely proportional to the square of t, we write s = k/t2, where k is a constant. We are not restricted to always using the letter k for our constant of propor- tionality. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Given that y is inversely proportional to x and the fact thatGiven that y is inversely proportional to x and that y = 5 when x = 8, determine the value of y when x = 10. y = 4 when x = 2, determine the constant of proportionality, then determine the value of y when x = 4. Solution: Given the fact the y is inversely proportional to x, we know imme- diately that y = k x , where k is the proportionality constant. Because we are given that y = 4 when x = 2, we can substitute 4 for y and 2 for x to determine k. y = k x y is inversely proportional to x. 4 = k 2 Substitute 4 for y, 2 for x. 8 = k Multiply both sides by 2. Substitute 8 for k in y = k/x, then substitute 4 for x to determine y when x = 4. y = 8 x Substitue 8 for k. y = 8 4 Substitute 4 for x. y = 2 Reduce. Note that as x increased from 2 to 4, y decreased from 4 to 2.Answer: 4 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. The intensity I of light is inversely proportional to the squareIf the light intensity 4 feet from a light source is 2 foot-candles, what is the intensity of the light 8 feet from the light source? of the distance d from the light source. If the light intensity 5 feet from the light source is 3 foot-candles, what is the intensity of the light 15 feet from the light source? 7.5. DIRECT AND INVERSE VARIATION 529 Solution: Given the fact that the intensity I of the light is inversely propor- tional to the square of the distance d from the light source, we know immedi- ately that I = k d2 , where k is the proportionality constant. Because we are given that the intensity is I = 3 foot-candles at d = 5 feet from the light source, we can substitute 3 for I and 5 for d to determine k. I = k d2 I is inversely proportional to d2. 3 = k 52 Substitute 3 for I, 5 for d. 3 = k 25 Simplify. 75 = k Multiply both sides by 25. Substitute 75 for k in I = k/d2, then substitute 15 for d to determine I when d = 15. I = 75 d2 Substitute 75 for k. I = 75 152 Substitute 15 for d. I = 75 225 Simplify. I = 1 3 Reduce. Thus, the intensity of the light 15 feet from the light source is 1/3 foot-candle. Answer: 1/2 foot-candle ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Suppose that the price per person for a camping experience is Suppose that the price per person for a tour is inversely proportional to the number of people who sign up for the tour. If 8 people sign up, the price per person is $70. What will be the price per person if 20 people sign up? inversely proportional to the number of people who sign up for the experience. If 10 people sign up, the price per person is $350. What will be the price per person if 50 people sign up? Solution: Let p represent the price per person and let N be the number of people who sign up for the camping experience. Because we are told that the price per person is inversely proportional to the number of people who sign up for the camping experience, we can write: p = k N , 530 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS where k is the proportionality constant. Because we are given that the price per person is $350 when 10 people sign up, we can substitute 350 for p and 10 for N to determine k. p = k N p is inversely proportional to N . 350 = k 10 Substitute 350 for p, 10 for N . 3500 = k Multiply both sides by 10. Substitute 3500 for k in p = k/N , then substitute 50 for N to determine p when N = 50. p = 3500 N Substitute 3500 for k. p = 3500 50 Substitute 50 for N . p = 70 Simplify. Thus, the price per person is $70 if 50 people sign up for the camping experi- ence.Answer: $28 ! 7.5. DIRECT AND INVERSE VARIATION 531 ! ! !
