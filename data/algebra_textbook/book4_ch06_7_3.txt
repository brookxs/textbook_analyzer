A Method of Dividing a Decimal by a Nonzero Whole Number Method of Dividing a Decimal by a Nonzero Whole Number To divide a decimal by a nonzero whole number: Write a decimal point above the division line and directly over the decimal point of the dividend. Proceed to divide as if both numbers were whole numbers. If, in the quotient, the first nonzero digit occurs to the right of the decimal point, but not in the tenths position, place a zero in each position between the decimal point and the first nonzero digit of the quotient. Sample Set A Find the decimal representations of the following quotients. Example 6.44.  114.1÷7 = 7 Thus, 114.1÷7 = 16.3. Check: If 114.1÷7 = 16.3, then 7⋅16.3 should equal 114.1. Example 6.45.  0.02068÷4 Place zeros in the tenths and hundredths positions. (See Step 3.) Thus, 0.02068÷4 = 0.00517. Practice Set A Find the following quotients. Exercise 6.7.1.
