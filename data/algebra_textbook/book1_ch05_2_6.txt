Literal Equations Literal Equations Some equations involve more than one variable. Such equations are called literal equations. An equation is solved for a particular variable if that variable alone equals an expression that does not contain that particular variable. The following equations are examples of literal equations. y = 2x + 7 . It is solved for y . d = r t . It is solved for d . I = p r t . It is solved for I . . It is solved for z . y + 1 = x + 4 . This equation is not solved for any particular variable since no variable is isolated. Literal Equations Literal Equations Some equations involve more than one variable.
