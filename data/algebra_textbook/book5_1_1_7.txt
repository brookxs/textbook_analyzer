Mathematical Properties of Multiplication The order in which we multiply integers does not matter. That is, (−8)(5) gives an answer identical to (5)(−8). In both cases, the answer is −40. This fact is called the commutative property of multiplication. The Commutative Property of Multiplication. If a and b are any two integers, then: a · b = b · a Next, when we multiply three integers, it does not matter which two we multiply first. If we multiply the second and third of three numbers first, we get: (−3)[ (−4)(−5) ] = (−3)(20) Brackets first: (−4)(−5) = 20 = −60 Multiply: (−3)(20) = −60 On the other hand, if we multiply the first and second of three numbers first, we get:[ (−3)(−4) ](−5) = (12)(−5) Brackets first: (−3)(−4) = 12 = −60 Multiply: (12)(−5) = −60 Thus, (−3)[(−4)(−5)] = [(−3)(−4)](−5). This fact is called the associative property of multiplication. The Associative Property of Multiplication. If a, b, and c are any three integers, then: a · (b · c) = (a · b) · c When you multiply an integer by 1, you get the identical number back as the product. For example, (1)(5) = 5 and (−11)(1) = −11. This fact is known as the multiplicative identity property. 10 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS The Multiplicative Identity Property. If a is any integer, then: 1 · a = a and a · 1 = a For this reason, the integer 1 is called the “multiplicative identity.” Finally, note that (−1)(5) = −5. Thus, multiplying 5 by −1 is identical to taking the “opposite” of 5 or negating 5. The Multiplicative Property of −1. Multiplying by minus one is identical to negating. That is: (−1)a = −a Mathematical Properties of Multiplication The order in which we multiply integers does not matter. That is, (−8)(5) gives an answer identical to (5)(−8).
