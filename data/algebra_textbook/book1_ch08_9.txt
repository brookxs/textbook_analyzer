 || Simple And Complex Fractions Simple Fraction In Section Section 8.2 we saw that a simple fraction was a fraction of the form where P and Q are polynomials and Q ≠ 0 . Complex Fraction A complex fraction is a fraction in which the numerator or denominator, or both, is a fraction. The fractions are examples of complex fractions, or more generally, complex rational expressions. There are two methods for simplifying complex rational expressions: the combine-divide method and the LCD-multiply-divide method.  || The Combine-Divide Method If necessary, combine the terms of the numerator together. If necessary, combine the terms of the denominator together. Divide the numerator by the denominator.  || The LCD-Multiply-Divide Method Find the LCD of all the terms. Multiply the numerator and denominator by the LCD. Reduce if necessary.  ||
