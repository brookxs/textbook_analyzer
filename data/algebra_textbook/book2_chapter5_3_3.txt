Adding and Subtracting Polynomial Functions We use function notation to indicate addition and subtraction of functions as follows: Addition of functions: ( f + g ) ( x ) = f ( x ) + g ( x ) Subtraction of functions: ( f − g ) ( x ) = f ( x ) − g ( x ) When using function notation, be careful to group the entire function and add or subtract accordingly.   Example 10: Calculate: ( f + g ) ( x ) , given f ( x ) = − x 2 − 3 x + 5 and g ( x ) = 3 x 2 + 2 x + 1 . Solution: The notation ( f + g ) ( x ) indicates that you should add the functions f ( x ) + g ( x ) and collect like terms. Answer: ( f + g ) ( x ) = 2 x 2 − x + 6   Example 11: Calculate: ( f − g ) ( x ) , given f ( x ) = 2 x − 3 and g ( x ) = − 2 x 2 + 2 x + 5 . Solution: The notation ( f − g ) ( x ) indicates that you should subtract the functions f ( x ) − g ( x ) : Answer: ( f − g ) ( x ) = 2 x 2 − 8   We may be asked to evaluate the sum or difference of two functions. We have the option to first find the sum or difference and use the resulting function to evaluate for the given variable, or to first evaluate each function and then find the sum or difference.   Example 12: Calculate: ( f − g ) ( 5 ) , given f ( x ) = x 2 + x − 7 and g ( x ) = 4 x + 10 . Solution: First, find ( f − g ) ( x ) = f ( x ) − g ( x ) . Therefore, Next, substitute 5 for the variable x. Answer: ( f − g ) ( 5 ) = − 7 Alternate Solution: Since ( f − g ) ( 5 ) = f ( 5 ) − g ( 5 ) , we can find f ( 5 ) and g ( 5 ) and then subtract the results. Therefore, we have Answer: ( f − g ) ( 5 ) = − 7 Adding and Subtracting Polynomial Functions We use function notation to indicate addition and subtraction of functions as follows: Addition of functions: ( f + g ) ( x ) = f ( x ) + g ( x ) Subtraction of functions: ( f − g ) ( x ) = f ( x ) − g ( x ) When using function notation, be careful to group the entire function and add or subtract accordingly.   Example 10: Calculate: ( f + g ) ( x ) , given f ( x ) = − x 2 − 3 x + 5 and g ( x ) = 3 x 2 + 2 x + 1 .
