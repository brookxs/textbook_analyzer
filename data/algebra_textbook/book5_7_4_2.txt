Numerical Applications Let’s apply what we’ve learned to an application. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. The sum of a number and its reciprocal is 41/20. Find the The sum of a number and its reciprocal is 53/14. Find the number. number. Solution: In the solution, we address each step of the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a variable dictionary. Let x represent the unknown number. 2. Set up an equation. If the unknown number is x, then its reciprocal is 1/x. Thus, the “sum of a number and its reciprocal is 41/20” becomes: x+ 1 x = 41 20 522 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS 3. Solve the equation. Clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by 20x, the least common denominator. x+ 1 x = 41 20 Model equation. 20x [ x+ 1 x ] = [ 41 20 ] 20x Multiply both sides by 20x. 20x [x] + 20x [ 1 x ] = [ 41 20 ] 20x Distribute 20x. 20x2 + 20 = 41x Cancel and simplify. The equation is nonlinear. Make one side zero. 20x2 − 41x+ 20 = 0 Make one side zero. The integer pair −16 and −25 has product ac = 400 and sum b = −41. Break up the middle term in the last equation into a sum of like terms using this pair, then factor by grouping. 20x2 − 16x− 25x+ 20 = 0 −16x− 25x = −41x. 4x(5x− 4)− 5(5x− 4) = 0 Factor by grouping. (4x− 5)(5x− 4) = 0 Factor out 5x− 4. We can now use the zero product property to write: 4x− 5 = 0 or 5x− 4 = 0 4x = 5 5x = 4 x = 5 4 x = 4 5 4. Answer the question. There are two possible numbers, 5/4 and 4/5. 5. Look back. The sum of the unknown number and its reciprocal is supposed to equal 41/20. The answer 5/4 has reciprocal 4/5. Their sum is: 5 4 + 4 5 = 16 20 + 25 20 = 41 20 Thus, 5/4 is a valid solution. The second answer 4/5 has reciprocal 5/4, so it is clear that their sum is also 41/20. Hence, 4/5 is also a valid solution. Answer: 2/7, 7/2 ! 7.4. SOLVING RATIONAL EQUATIONS 523 ! ! ! Numerical Applications Let’s apply what we’ve learned to an application. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4.
