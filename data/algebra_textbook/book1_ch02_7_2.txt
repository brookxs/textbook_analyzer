The Power Rule for Powers The following examples suggest a rule for raising a power to a power: Example 2.95.  (a 2 ) 3 = a 2  ⋅ ​a 2  ⋅ a 2 Using the product rule we get Example 2.96.  POWER RULE FOR POWERS If x is a real number and n and m are natural numbers, (x n ) m = x n⋅m To raise a power to a power, multiply the exponents.
