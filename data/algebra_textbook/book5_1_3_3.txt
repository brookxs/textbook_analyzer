Dividing Fractions Every nonzero rational number has was it called a multiplicative inverse or reciprocal. The Reciprocal. If a is any nonzero rational number, then 1/a is called the multiplicative inverse or reciprocal of a, and: a · 1 a = 1 Note that: 2 · 1 2 = 1 and 3 5 · 5 3 = 1 and − 4 7 · ( −7 4 ) = 1. Thus, the reciprocal of 2 is 1/2, the reciprocal of 3/5 is 5/3, and the reciprocal of −4/7 is −7/4. Note that to find the reciprocal of a number, simply invert the number (flip it upside down). Now we can define the quotient of two fractions. Division of Fractions. If a/b and c/d are two fractions, then their quotient is defined as follows: a b ÷ c d = a b · d c That is, dividing by c/d is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal d/c. The above definition of division is summarized by the phrase “invert and mul- tiply.” You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify: −35 21 ÷ ( −10 12 ) Simplify: −4 9 ÷ 27 81 Solution: Invert and multiply, then factor in place and cancel common factors in a numerator for common factors in a denominator. −35 21 ÷ ( −10 12 ) = −35 21 · ( −12 10 ) Invert and multiply. = −5 · 7 3 · 7 · ( −2 · 2 · 3 2 · 5 ) Prime factor. = −!5 · !7 !3 · !7 · ( −!2 · 2 · !3 !2 · !5 ) Cancel common factors. = 2 1 Multiply numerators and denominators. = 2 Simplify. 36 CHAPTER 1. THE ARITHMETIC OF NUMBERS Note that when all the factors in a denominator cancel, a 1 remains. Thus, (−35/21)÷ (−10/12) = 2. Note also that like signs yield a positive result.Answer: −4/3 !
