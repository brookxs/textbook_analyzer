Speeding Things Up a Bit Let’s rexamine Example 9 with the hope of unearthing a pattern that will allow multiplication of polynomials to proceed more quickly with less work. Note the first step of Example 9. (x+ 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x(x2 + 2x+ 7) + 5(x2 + 2x+ 7) Note that the first product on the right is the result of taking the product of the first term of x + 5 and x2 + 2x + 7. Similarly, the second product on the right is the result of taking the product of the second term of x + 5 and x2 + 2x+ 7. Next, let’s examine the result of the second step. (x + 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x3 + 2x2 + 7x+ 5x2 + 10x+ 35 The first three terms on the right are the result of multiplying x times x2+2x+7. (x + 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x3 + 2x2 + 7x+ · · · The second set of three terms on the right are the result of multiplying 5 times x2 + 2x+ 7.
