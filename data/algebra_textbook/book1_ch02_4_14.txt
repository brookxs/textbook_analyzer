The Identity Properties Additive Identity The number 0 is called the additive identity since when it is added to any real number, it preserves the identity of that number. Zero is the only additive identity.For example, 6 + 0 = 6 . Multiplicative Identity The number 1 is called the multiplicative identity since when it multiplies any real number, it preserves the identity of that number. One is the only multiplicative identity.For example 6⋅1 = 6 . We summarize the identity properties as follows.
