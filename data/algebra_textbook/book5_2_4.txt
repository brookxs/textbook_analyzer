2.4 Formulae The formulae of science usually contain variable letters other than the variable “Formulae” is the plural for “formula.”x. Indeed, formulae in science typically use several letters. For example, Isaac Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation says that the magnitude of the force of attraction between two celestial bodies is given by the formula F = GMm r2 , where m usually denotes the mass of the smaller body, M the mass of the larger body, and r is the distance between the two bodies. The letter G represents the universal gravitational constant, having value 6.67428× 10−11 N(m/kg)2. Variable case. Note the use of upper and lower case letter M’s in Newton’s Law of Gravitation. When working with scientific formulae, you must maintain the case of the given letters. You are not allowed to substitute lower for upper case, or upper for lower case in your work. In Section 2.2, we described the goal that must be met when we are asked to “solve an equation for x.” Solve for x. When asked to solve an equation for x, the goal is to manipulate the equation into the final form x = “Stuff”, where “Stuff” is a valid mathematical expression that may contain other vari- ables, mathematical symbols, etc., but it must not contain any occurrence of the variable x. Thus, to solve an equation for x, we need to isolate the terms containing x on one side of the equation, and all remaining terms on the other side of the equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve for x: x+ a = b. Solve for x: x− c = dSolution: To undo the effects of adding a, subtract a from both sides of the equation. x+ a = b Original equation. x+ a− a = b − a Subtract a from both sides. x = b − a Simplify. Answer: x = c+ d. ! 112 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES In Example 1, note that the answer x = b − a has the required form, x = “Stuff”, where “Stuff” is a valid mathematical expression that contains other variables, mathematical symbols, etc., but it does not contain any occurrence of the variable x. Now, what if we were asked to solve the same equation for a, instead of x? You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Solve for a: x+ a = b.Solve for x: x− c = d Solution: We are instructed to solve the equation x+a = b for a. This means that our final answer must have the form a = “Stuff”, where “Stuff” is a valid mathematical expression that contains other variables, mathematical symbols, etc., but it does not contain any occurrence of the variable a. This means that we must isolate all terms containing the variable a on one side of the equation, and all remaining terms on the other side of the equation. Now, to undo the effect of adding x, subtract x from both sides of the equation. x+ a = b Original equation. x+ a− x = b− x Subtract x from both sides. a = b− x Simplify.

The formula F = kx, known as “Hooke’s Law”, predicts theSolve for m: E = mc2 force F required to stretch a spring x units. Solve the equation for k. Solution: We are instructed to solve the equation F = kx for k. This means that our final answer must have the form k = “Stuff”, where “Stuff” is a valid mathematical expression that may contain other variables, mathematical symbols, etc., but it may not contain any occurrence of the variable k. This means that we must isolate all terms containing the variable k on one side of the equation, and all remaining terms on the other side of the equation. However, note that all terms containing the variable k are already isolated on one side of the equation. Terms not containing the variable k are isolated on the other side of the equation. Now, to “undo” the effect of multiplying by x, divide both sides of the equation by x. F = kx Original equation. F x = kx x Divide both sides by x. F x = k Simplify. 2.4. FORMULAE 113 Saying that F/x = k is equivalent to saying that k = F/x. We can leave our answer in the form shown in the last step, but some instructors insist that we write the answer as follows: k = F x F/x = k is equivalent to k = F/x.

L W L W The perimeter (distance around) of the rectangle is found by summing its four sides, then combining like terms. P = L+W + L+W Summing the four sides. P = 2W + 2L Combine like terms. Problem: Solve P = 2W + 2L for L. Then, given that the perimeter is 300 feet and the width is 50 feet, use your result to calculate the length. Solution: We’re first asked to solve P = 2W + 2L for L. First, isolate all 116 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES terms containing the variable L on one side of the equation. P = 2W + 2L Original equation. P − 2W = 2W + 2L− 2W Subtract 2W from both sides. P − 2W = 2L Simplify. P − 2W 2 = 2L 2 Divide both sides by 2. P − 2W 2 = L Simplify.

Secondly, given that the area is A = 90 in2 (90 square inches) and the length of the base is 15 in (15 inches), find the height of the triangle. Solution: We’re first asked to solve A = (1/2)bh for h. Because the equation has fractions, the first step is to clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by the least common denominator. A = 1 2 bh Area of a triangle formula. 2(A) = 2 ( 1 2 bh ) Multiply both sides by 2. 2A = bh Simplify. Now, we already have all terms containing the variable h on one side of the equation, so we can solve for h by dividing both sides of the equation by b. 2A b = bh b Divide both sides by b. 2A b = h Simplify.

The second part of this example requests that we find the height of the triangle, given that the area is A = 90 in2 and the length of the base is b = 15 in. To calculate the height of the triangle, substitute A = 90 and b = 15 in h = 2A/b. h = 2A b Area formula solved for h. h = 2(90) 15 Substitute 90 for A, 15 for b. h = 180 15 Multiply: 2(90) = 180. h = 12 Divide: 180/15 = 12.
