 || The General Form of a Line We have seen that the general form of a linear equation in two variables is a x + b y = c (Section Section 7.4). When this equation is solved for y , the resulting form is called the slope-intercept form. Let's generate this new form. This equation is of the form y = m x + b if we replace with m and constant with b . (Note: The fact that we let is unfortunate and occurs beacuse of the letters we have chosen to use in the general form. The letter b occurs on both sides of the equal sign and may not represent the same value at all. This problem is one of the historical convention and, fortunately, does not occur very often.) The following examples illustrate this procedure. Example 7.15.  Solve 3x + 2y = 6 for y . This equation is of the form y = m x + b . In this case, and b = 3 . Example 7.16.  Solve – 15x + 5y = 20 for y . This equation is of the form y = m x + b . In this case, m = 3 and b = 4 . Example 7.17.  Solve 4x – y = 0 for y . This equation is of the form y = m x + b . In this case, m = 4 and b = 0 . Notice that we can write y = 4x as y = 4x + 0 .  || The Slope-Intercept Form of a Line The Slope-Intercept Form of a Line y = m x + b A linear equation in two variables written in the form y = m x + b is said to be in slope-intercept form.  || Slope and Intercept When the equation of a line is written in slope-intercept form, two important properties of the line can be seen: the slope and the intercept. Let's look at these two properties by graphing several lines and observing them carefully.  || The Formula for the Slope of a Line We have observed that the slope is a measure of the steepness of a line. We wish to develop a formula for measuring this steepness. It seems reasonable to develop a slope formula that produces the following results: Steepness of line 1 > steepness of line 2. Consider a line on which we select any two points. We’ll denote these points with the ordered pairs (x 1,  y 1  ) and (x 2,  y 2  ) . The subscripts help us to identify the points. (x 1,  y 1  ) is the first point. Subscript 1 indicates the first point. (x 2,  y 2  ) is the second point. Subscript 2 indicates the second point. The difference in x values (x 2 − x 1 ) gives us the horizontal change, and the difference in y values (y 2 − y 1 ) gives us the vertical change. If the line is very steep, then when going from the first point to the second point, we would expect a large vertical change compared to the horizontal change. If the line is not very steep, then when going from the first point to the second point, we would expect a small vertical change compared to the horizontal change. We are comparing changes. We see that we are comparing This is a comparison and is therefore a ratio. Ratios can be expressed as fractions. Thus, a measure of the steepness of a line can be expressed as a ratio. The slope of a line is defined as the ratio Mathematically, we can write these changes as Finding the Slope of a Line The slope of a nonvertical line passing through the points (x 1,  y 1  ) and (x 2,  y 2  ) is found by the formula  || Calculator Problems For the following problems, determine the slope and y-intercept of the lines.
