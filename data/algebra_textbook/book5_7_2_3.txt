Placing a Number in Scientific Notation To place a number into scientific notation, we need to move the decimal point so that exactly one of the digits 1, 2, 3, . . . , 9 remains to the left of the decimal point, then multiply by the appropriate power of 10 so that the result is equivalent to the original number. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Place the number 1,234 in scientific notation. Place the number 54,321 in scientific notation. Solution. Move the decimal point three places to the left so that it is posi- tioned just after the 1. To make this new number equal to 1,234, multiply by 103. Thus: 1, 234 = 1.234× 103 496 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS Check: Multiplying by 103 moves the decimal three places to the right, so: 1.234× 103 = 1, 234 This is the original number, so our scientific notation form is correct.Answer: 5.4321× 104 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Place the number 0.000025 in scientific notation.Place the number 0.0175 in scientific notation. Solution. Move the decimal point five places to the right so that it is posi- tioned just after the 2. To make this new number equal to 0.000025, multiply by 10−5. Thus: 0.000025 = 2.5× 10−5 Check: Multiplying by 10−5 moves the decimal five places to the left, so: 2.5× 10−5 = 0.000025 This is the original number, so our scientific notation form is correct.Answer: 1.75× 10−2 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Place the number 34.5× 10−11 in scientific notation.Place the number 756.98× 10−5 in scientific notation. Solution. First, move the decimal point one place to the left so that it is positioned just after the three. To make this new form equal to 34.5, multiply by 101. 34.5× 10−11 = 3.45× 101 × 10−11 Now, repeat the base 10 and add the exponents. = 3.45× 10−10 Answer: 7.5698× 10−3 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Place the number 0.00093× 1012 in scientific notation.Place the number 0.00824× 108 in scientific notation. Solution. First, move the decimal point four places to the right so that it is positioned just after the nine. To make this new form equal to 0.00093, multiply by 10−4. 0.00093× 1012 = 9.3× 10−4 × 1012 7.2.
