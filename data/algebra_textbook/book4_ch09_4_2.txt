Converting to Multiple Units Denominate Numbers Numbers that have units of measure associated with them are called denominate numbers. It is often convenient, or even necessary, to simplify a denominate number. Simplified Denominate Number A denominate number is simplified when the number of standard units of measure associated With it does not exceed the next higher type of unit. The denominate number 55 min is simplified since it is smaller than the next higher type of unit, 1 hr. The denominate number 65 min is not simplified since it is not smaller than the next higher type of unit, 1 hr. The denominate number 65 min can be simplified to 1 hr 5 min. The denominate number 1 hr 5 min is simplified since the next higher type of unit is day, and 1 hr does not exceed 1 day. Sample Set A Example 9.8.  Simplify 19 in. Since 12  in. = 1 ft, and 19 = 12 + 7, Example 9.9.  Simplify 4 gal 5 qt. Since 4  qt = 1 gal, and 5 = 4 + 1, Example 9.10.  Simplify 2 hr 75 min. Since 60 min = 1 hr, and 75 = 60 + 15, Example 9.11.  Simplify 43 fl oz. Since 8 fl oz = 1 c (1 cup), and 43÷8 = 5 R3, But, 2 c = 1 pt and 5÷2 = 2 R1. So, But, 2 pt = 1 qt, so 2 pt + 1 c + 3 fl oz = 1 qt 1 c 3 fl oz Practice Set A Simplify each denominate number. Refer to the conversion tables given in Section 9.2, if necessary. Exercise 9.4.1.
