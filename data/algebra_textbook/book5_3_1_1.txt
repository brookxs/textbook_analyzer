In that same treatise, Descartes introduces his coordinate system, a method for representing points in the plane via pairs of real numbers. Indeed, the Cartesian plane of modern day is so named in honor of Rene Descartes, who some call the “Father of Modern Mathematics” created two real lines, one horizontal labeled x (we’ll refer to this one as the x-axis), and the other vertical labeled y (we’ll refer to this one as the y-axis). −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 1 2 3 4 5 −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 1 2 3 4 5 x y Figure 3.1: The Cartesian Coordinate System.

As you move from left to right along the horizontal axis (the x-axis in Figure 3.1), the numbers grow larger. The positive direction is to the right, the negative direction is to the left. 2.
