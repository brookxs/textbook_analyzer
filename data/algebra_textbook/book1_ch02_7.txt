 || The Power Rule for Powers The following examples suggest a rule for raising a power to a power: Example 2.95.  (a 2 ) 3 = a 2  ⋅ ​a 2  ⋅ a 2 Using the product rule we get Example 2.96.  POWER RULE FOR POWERS If x is a real number and n and m are natural numbers, (x n ) m = x n⋅m To raise a power to a power, multiply the exponents.  || The Power Rule for Products The following examples suggest a rule for raising a product to a power: Example 2.101.  Example 2.102.  Example 2.103.  POWER RULE FOR PRODUCTS If x and y are real numbers and n is a natural number, (x y) n = x n y n To raise a product to a power, apply the exponent to each and every factor.  || The Power Rule for Quotients The following example suggests a rule for raising a quotient to a power. Example 2.112.  POWER RULE FOR QUOTIENTS If x and y are real numbers and n is a natural number, To raise a quotient to a power, distribute the exponent to both the numerator and denominator.  ||
