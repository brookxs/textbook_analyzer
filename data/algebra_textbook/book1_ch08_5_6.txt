The Least Common Denominator (LCD) In arithmetic, the least common denominator is the smallest (least) quantity that each of the given denominators will divide into without a remainder. For algebraic expressions, the LCD is the polynomial of least degree divisible by each denominator. Some examples are shown below. Example 8.65.  The LCD is 12 since 12 is the smallest number that 4, 6, and 12 will divide into without a remainder. Example 8.66.  The LCD is 24 since 24 is the smallest number that 3, 6, 8, and 12 will divide into without a remainder. Example 8.67.  The LCD is x 2 since x 2 is the smallest quantity that x and x 2 will divide into without a remainder. Example 8.68.  The LCD is 24a 2 b 3 since 24a 2 b 3 is the smallest quantity that 6a 2 b and 8a b 3 will divide into without a remainder. Example 8.69.  The LCD is ( y − 6 ) 3 ( y − 1 ) since ( y − 6 ) 3   ·  ( y − 1 ) is the smallest quantity that y − 6, ( y − 6 ) 3 and y − 1 will divide into without a remainder. We’ll now propose and demonstrate a method for obtaining the LCD. Method for Obtaining the LCD Factor each denominator. Use exponents for repeated factors. It is usually not necessary to factor numerical quantities. Write down each different factor that appears. If a factor appears more than once, use only the factor with the highest exponent. The LCD is the product of the factors written in step 2.
