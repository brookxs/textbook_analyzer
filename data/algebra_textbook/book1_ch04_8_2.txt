Independent and Dependent Variables Independent and Dependent Variables In an equation, any variable whose value can be freely assigned is said to be an independent variable. Any variable whose value is determined once the other values have been assigned is said to be a dependent variable. Two examples will help illustrate these concepts. Consider the equation y = 2x − 7 . If we are free to choose values for x , then x would be considered the independent variable. Since the value of y depends on the value of x , y would be the dependent variable. Consider the equation m = − 4g k 2 . If we are free to choose values for both g and k , then g and k would be considered independent variables. Since the value of m depends on the values chosen for g and k , m would be the dependent variable.
