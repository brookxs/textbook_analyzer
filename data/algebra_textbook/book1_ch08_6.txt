 || Basic Rule We are now in a position to study the process of adding and subtracting rational expressions. There is a most basic rule to which we must strictly adhere if we wish to conveniently add or subtract rational expressions. To add or subtract rational expressions conveniently, they should have the same denominators. Thus, to add or subtract two or more rational expressions conveniently, we must ensure that they all have the same denominator. The denominator that is most convenient is the LCD.  || Fractions With The Same Denominator The Rule for Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions To add (or subtract) two or more rational expressions with the same denominators, add (or subtract) the numerators and place the result over the LCD. Reduce if necessary. Symbolically, Note that we combine only the numerators.  || Fractions with Different Denominators  ||
