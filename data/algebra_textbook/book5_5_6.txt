MULTIPLYING POLYNOMIALS 357 When multiplying monomials, it is much more efficient to make the required calculations mentally. In the case of Example 1, multiply −5 and 7 mentally to get −5(7y) = −35y. In the case of Example 2, multiply −3 and 4 to get −12, then repeat the base x and add exponents to get (−3x2)(4x3) = −12x5. Finally, in the case of Example 3, multiply −2 and −5 to get 10, then repeat the bases and add their exponents. (−2a2b3)(−5a3b) = 10a5b4  || Multiplying a Monomial and a Polynomial Now we turn our attention to the product of a monomial and a polynomial. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Multiply: 5(3x2 − 4x− 8) Multiply: 4(−2y2 + 3y + 5) Solution: We need to first distribute the 5 times each term of the polynomial. Then we multiply the resulting monomials mentally. 5(3x2 − 4x− 8) = 5(3x2)− 5(4x)− 5(8) = 15x2 − 20x− 40 Answer: −8y2 + 12y + 20 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Multiply: 2y(−3y + 5) Multiply: −3x(4− 2x) Solution: We need to first distribute the 2y times each term of the polynomial. Then we multiply the resulting monomials mentally. 2y(−3y + 5) = 2y(−3y) + 2y(5) = −6y2 + 10y Answer: −12x+ 6x2 ! 358 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Multiply: −3ab(a2 + 2ab− b2)Multiply: 2xy(x2 − 4xy2 + 7x) Solution: We need to first distribute the −3ab times each term of the poly- nomial. Then we multiply the resulting monomials mentally. −3ab(a2 + 2ab− b2) = −3ab(a2) + (−3ab)(2ab)− (−3ab)(b2) = −3a3b+ (−6a2b2)− (−3ab3) = −3a3b− 6a2b2 + 3ab3 Alternate solution: It is far more efficient to perform most of the steps of the product −3ab(a2 + 2ab − b2) mentally. We know we must multiply −3ab times each of the terms of the polynomial a2 + 2ab− b2. Here are our mental calculations: i) −3ab times a2 equals −3a3b. ii) −3ab times 2ab equals −6a2b2. iii) −3ab times −b2 equals 3ab3. Thinking in this manner allows us to write down the answer without any of the steps shown in our first solution. That is, we immediately write: −3ab(a2 + 2ab− b2) = −3a3b− 6a2b2 + 3ab3 Answer: 2x3y − 8x2y3 + 14x2y ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Multiply: −2z2(z3 + 4z2 − 11)Multiply: −5y3(y2 − 2y + 1) Solution: We need to first distribute the −2z2 times each term of the poly- nomial. Then we multiply the resulting monomials mentally. −2z2(z3 + 4z2 − 11) = −2z2(z3) + (−2z2)(4z2)− (−2z2)(11) = −2z5 + (−8z4)− (−22z2) = −2z5 − 8z4 + 22z2 Alternate solution: It is far more efficient to perform most of the steps of the product −2z2(z3 + 4z2 − 11) mentally. We know we must multiply −2z2 times each of the terms of the polynomial z3 + 4z2 − 11. Here are our mental calculations: 5.6. MULTIPLYING POLYNOMIALS 359 i) −2z2 times z3 equals −2z5. ii) −2z2 times 4z2 equals −8z4. iii) −2z2 times −11 equals 22z2. Thinking in this manner allows us to write down the answer without any of the steps shown in our first solution. That is, we immediately write: −2z2(z3 + 4z2 − 11) = −2z5 − 8z4 + 22z2 Answer: −5y5 + 10y4 − 5y3 !  || Multiplying Polynomials Now that we’ve learned how to take the product of two monomials or the product of a monomial and a polynomial, we can apply what we’ve learned to multiply two arbitrary polynomials. Before we begin with the examples, let’s revisit the distributive property. We know that 2 · (3 + 4) = 2 · 3 + 2 · 4. Both sides are equal to 14. We’re used to having the monomial factor on the left, but it can also appear on the right. (3 + 4) · 2 = 3 · 2 + 4 · 2 Again, both sides equal 14. So, whether the monomial appears on the left or right makes no difference; that is, a(b + c) = ab + ac and (b + c)a = ba + ca give the same result. In each case, you multiply a times both terms of b+ c. You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Multiply: (2x+ 5)(3x+ 2) Multiply: (3x+ 4)(5x+ 1) Solution: Note that (2x + 5)(3x + 2) has the form (b + c)a, where a is the binomial 3x+2. Because (b+ c)a = ba+ ca, we will multiply 3x+2 times both terms of 2x+ 5 in the following manner. (2x+ 5)(3x+ 2) = 2x(3x+ 2) + 5(3x+ 2) Now we distribute monomials times polynomials, then combine like terms. = 6x2 + 4x+ 15x+ 10 = 6x2 + 19x+ 10 Thus, (2x+ 5)(3x+ 2) = 6x2 + 19x+ 10. Answer: 15x2 + 23x+ 4 ! 360 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Multiply: (x+ 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7)Multiply: (z + 4)(z2 + 3z + 9) Solution: Note that (x+5)(x2 +2x+7) has the form (b+ c)a, where a is the trinomial x2 +2x+7. Because (b+ c)a = ba+ ca, we will multiply x2 +2x+7 times both terms of x+ 5 in the following manner. (x+ 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x(x2 + 2x+ 7) + 5(x2 + 2x+ 7) Now we distribute monomials times polynomials, then combine like terms. = x3 + 2x2 + 7x+ 5x2 + 10x+ 35 = x3 + 7x2 + 17x+ 35 Thus, (x+ 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x3 + 7x2 + 17x+ 35.Answer: z3 +7z2 +21z+36 !  || Speeding Things Up a Bit Let’s rexamine Example 9 with the hope of unearthing a pattern that will allow multiplication of polynomials to proceed more quickly with less work. Note the first step of Example 9. (x+ 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x(x2 + 2x+ 7) + 5(x2 + 2x+ 7) Note that the first product on the right is the result of taking the product of the first term of x + 5 and x2 + 2x + 7. Similarly, the second product on the right is the result of taking the product of the second term of x + 5 and x2 + 2x+ 7. Next, let’s examine the result of the second step. (x + 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x3 + 2x2 + 7x+ 5x2 + 10x+ 35 The first three terms on the right are the result of multiplying x times x2+2x+7. (x + 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x3 + 2x2 + 7x+ · · · The second set of three terms on the right are the result of multiplying 5 times x2 + 2x+ 7. (x + 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = · · ·+ 5x2 + 10x+ 35 These notes suggest an efficient shortcut. To multiply x+5 times x2 +2x+7, • multiply x times each term of x2 + 2x+ 7, then • multiply 5 times each term of x2 + 2x+ 7. • Combine like terms. 5.6. MULTIPLYING POLYNOMIALS 361 This process would have the following appearance. (x+ 5)(x2 + 2x+ 7) = x3 + 2x2 + 7x+ 5x2 + 10x+ 35 = x3 + 7x2 + 17x+ 35 You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Use the shortcut technique described above to simplify Multiply: (3x+ 2)(4x2 − x+ 10) (2y − 6)(3y2 + 4y + 11) Solution: Multiply 2y times each term of 3y2 + 4y + 11, then multiply −6 times each term of 3y2 + 4y + 11. Finally, combine like terms. (2y − 6)(3y2 + 4y + 11) = 6y3 + 8y2 + 22y − 18y2 − 24y − 66 = 6y3 − 10y2 − 2y − 66 Answer: 12x3 + 5x2 + 28x+ 20 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Use the shortcut technique to simplify (a+ b)2. Multiply: (3y − 2)2 Solution: To simplify (a+ b)2, we first must write a+ b as a factor two times. (a+ b)2 = (a+ b)(a+ b) Next, multiply a times both terms of a + b, multiply b times both terms of a+ b, then combine like terms. = a2 + ab+ ba+ b2 = a2 + 2ab+ b2 Note that ab = ba because multiplication is commutative, so ab+ ba = 2ab.

POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Solution: This time the first factor contains three terms, x2, x, and 1, so we first multiply x2 times each term of x2 − x− 1, then x times each term of x2 − x− 1, and 1 times each term of x2 − x− 1. Then we combine like terms. (x2 + x+ 1)(x2 − x− 1) = x4 − x3 − x2 + x3 − x2 − x+ x2 − x− 1 = x4 − x2 − 2x− 1 Answer: a4 − 4a2 + 12a− 9 !  || Some Applications Recall that the area of a circle of radius r is found using the formula A = pir2.

MULTIPLYING POLYNOMIALS 363 Solution: We can find the area of the shaded region by subtracting the area of the inner circle from the area of the outer circle. A = Area of outer circle−Area of inner circle We use the formula A = pir2 to compute the area of each circle. Because the outer circle has radius x+1, it has area pi(x+1)2. Because the inner circle has radius x, it has area pix2. = pi(x+ 1)2 − pix2 Next, we’ll expand (x+ 1)2, then combine like terms. = pi(x+ 1)(x+ 1)− pix2 = pi(x2 + x+ x+ 1)− pix2 = pi(x2 + 2x+ 1)− pix2 Finally, distribute pi times each term of x2 + 2x+ 1, then combine like terms. = pix2 + 2pix+ pi − pix2 = 2pix+ pi Hence, the area of the shaded region is A = 2pix+ pi. Answer: 4pix+ 4pi ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 14. The demand for widgets is a function of the unit price, Suppose that the demand for gadgets is given by the function x = 320− 1.5p, where x is the demand and p is the unit price. Use the graphing calculator to determine the unit price a retailer should charge for gadgets so that her revenue from sales equals $12,000. where the demand is the number of widgets the public will buy and the unit price is the amount charged for a single widget. Suppose that the demand is given by the function x = 270− 0.75p, where x is the demand and p is the unit price. Note how the demand decreases as the unit price goes up (makes sense). Use the graphing calculator to determine the unit price a retailer should charge for widgets so that his revenue from sales equals $20,000. Solution: To determine the revenue (R), you multiply the number of widgets sold (x) by the unit price (p). R = xp (5.5) However, we know that the number of units sold is the demand, given by the formula x = 270− 0.75p (5.6) Substitute equation 5.6 into equation 5.5 to obtain the revenue as a function of the unit price. R = (270− 0.75p)p 364 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Expand. R = 270p− 0.75p2 (5.7) We’re asked to determine the unit price that brings in a revenue of $20,000.
