Factoring Using the AC Method An alternate technique for factoring trinomials, called the AC method Method for factoring trinomials by replacing the middle term with two terms that allow us to factor the resulting four-term polynomial by grouping. , makes use of the grouping method for factoring four-term polynomials. If a trinomial in the form a x 2 + b x + c can be factored, then the middle term, bx, can be replaced with two terms with coefficients whose sum is b and product ac. This substitution results in an equivalent expression with four terms that can be factored by grouping. The steps are outlined in the following example.   Example 7: Factor using the AC method: x 2 − x − 30 . Solution: In this example a = 1, b = −1, and c = −30. Step 1: Determine the product ac. Step 2: Find factors of ac whose sum equals the coefficient of the middle term, b. We can see that the sum of the factors 5 and −6 is equal to the coefficient of the middle term, −1. Step 3: Use the factors as coefficients for the terms that replace the middle term. Here − x = − 6 x + 5 x . Write Step 4: Factor the equivalent expression by grouping. Answer: ( x − 6 ) ( x + 5 )   Notice that the AC method is consistent with the trial and error method. Both methods require that b = m + n , where c = m n . In the example above, − 30 = ( − 6 ) ( 5 ) and − 1 = ( − 6 ) + 5 . The only difference between the methods, when the leading coefficient is 1, is in the process used to obtain the final factorization.   Example 8: Factor: y 2 − 14 x + 48 . Solution: Here ac = 48 and we search for factors whose sum is −14. Therefore, − 14 x = − 6 x − 8 x . Substitute the new terms and factor by grouping. Answer: ( x − 6 ) ( x − 8 ) . The check is left to the reader.   At this point, it is recommended that the reader stop and factor as many trinomials of the form x 2 + b x + c as time allows before moving on to the next section. Factoring trinomials is one of the more important skills that we learn in this course and should be mastered.
