Method For Solving Square Root Equations Solving Square Root Equations Isolate a radical. This means get a square root expression by itself on one side of the equal sign. Square both sides of the equation. Simplify the equation by combining like terms. Repeat step 1 if radicals are still present. Obtain potential solutions by solving the resulting non-square root equation. Check each potential solution by substitution into the original equation.
