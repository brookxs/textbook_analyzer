The Real Numbers The collection of real numbers has many subcollections. The subcollections that are of most interest to us are listed below along with their notations and graphs. Natural Numbers The natural numbers (N) :   {1, 2,3, …} Whole Numbers The whole numbers (W) :   {0, 1, 2,3, …} Notice that every natural number is a whole number. Integers The integers (Z) :   {…,  − 3, −  2, − 1,0,1, 2, 3, …} Notice that every whole number is an integer. Rational Numbers The rational numbers (Q) : Rational numbers are real numbers that can be written in the form a / b , where a and b are integers, and b ≠ 0 . Fractions Rational numbers are commonly called fractions. Division by 1 Since b can equal 1, every integer is a rational number: . Division by 0 Recall that 10 / 2 = 5 since 2⋅5 = 10 . However, if 10 / 0 = x , then 0⋅x = 10 . But 0⋅x = 0 , not 10. This suggests that no quotient exists. Now consider 0 / 0 = x . If 0 / 0 = x , then 0⋅x = 0 . But this means that x could be any number, that is, 0 / 0 = 4 since 0⋅4 = 0 , or 0 / 0 = 28 since 0⋅28 = 0 . This suggests that the quotient is indeterminant. x / 0 Is Undefined or Indeterminant Division by 0 is undefined or indeterminant.Do not divide by 0. Rational numbers have decimal representations that either terminate or do not terminate but contain a repeating block of digits. Some examples are: Some rational numbers are graphed below. Irrational Numbers The irrational numbers (I r) : Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as the quotient of two integers. They are numbers whose decimal representations are nonterminating and nonrepeating. Some examples are Notice that the collections of rational numbers and irrational numbers have no numbers in common. When graphed on the number line, the rational and irrational numbers account for every point on the number line. Thus each point on the number line has a coordinate that is either a rational or an irrational number. In summary, we have The Real Numbers The collection of real numbers has many subcollections.
