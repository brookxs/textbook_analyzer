 || If the Denominator Contains Two Terms If the denominator contains a square root plus some other terms, a special trick does the job. It makes use of the difference of two squares formula:               (a + b)(a – b) = a2 – b2   Suppose that your denominator looked like a + b, where b was a square root and a represents all the other terms. If you multiply it by a – b, then you will end up with the square of your square root, which means no more square roots. It is called the conjugate when you replace the plus with a minus (or vice-versa). An example would help.   Example:  Given: Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator: Multiply out:  ||
