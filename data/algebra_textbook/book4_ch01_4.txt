 || Rounding as an Approximation A primary use of whole numbers is to keep count of how many objects there are in a collection. Sometimes we're only interested in the approximate number of objects in the collection rather than the precise number. For example, there are approxi­mately 20 symbols in the collection below. The precise number of symbols in the above collection is 18. Rounding We often approximate the number of objects in a collection by mentally seeing the collection as occurring in groups of tens, hundreds, thousands, etc. This process of approximation is called rounding. Rounding is very useful in estimation. We will study estimation in Chapter 8. When we think of a collection as occurring in groups of tens, we say we're rounding to the nearest ten. When we think of a collection as occurring in groups of hundreds, we say we're rounding to the nearest hundred. This idea of rounding continues through thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions, etc. The process of rounding whole numbers is illustrated in the following examples. Example 1.12.  Round 67 to the nearest ten. On the number line, 67 is more than halfway from 60 to 70. The digit immedi­ately to the right of the tens digit, the round-off digit, is the indicator for this. Thus, 67, rounded to the nearest ten, is 70. Example 1.13.  Round 4,329 to the nearest hundred. On the number line, 4,329 is less than halfway from 4,300 to 4,400. The digit to the immediate right of the hundreds digit, the round-off digit, is the indicator. Thus, 4,329, rounded to the nearest hundred is 4,300. Example 1.14.  Round 16,500 to the nearest thousand. On the number line, 16,500 is exactly halfway from 16,000 to 17,000. By convention, when the number to be rounded is exactly halfway between two numbers, it is rounded to the higher number. Thus, 16,500, rounded to the nearest thousand, is 17,000. Example 1.15.  A person whose salary is $41,450 per year might tell a friend that she makes $41,000 per year. She has rounded 41,450 to the nearest thousand. The number 41,450 is closer to 41,000 than it is to 42,000.  || The Method of Rounding Whole Numbers From the observations made in the preceding examples, we can use the following method to round a whole number to a particular position. Mark the position of the round-off digit. Note the digit to the immediate right of the round-off digit. If it is less than 5, replace it and all the digits to its right with zeros. Leave the round-off digit unchanged. If it is 5 or larger, replace it and all the digits to its right with zeros. Increase the round-off digit by 1. Sample Set A Use the method of rounding whole numbers to solve the following problems. Example 1.16.  Round 3,426 to the nearest ten. We are rounding to the tens position. Mark the digit in the tens position Observe the digit immediately to the right of the tens position. It is 6. Since 6 is greater than 5, we round up by replacing 6 with 0 and adding 1 to the digit in the tens position (the round-off position): 2 + 1 = 3 . 3,430 Thus, 3,426 rounded to the nearest ten is 3,430. Example 1.17.  Round 9,614,018,007 to the nearest ten million. We are rounding to the nearest ten million. Observe the digit immediately to the right of the ten millions position. It is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we round down by replacing 4 and all the digits to its right with zeros. 9,610,000,000 Thus, 9,614,018,007 rounded to the nearest ten million is 9,610,000,000. Example 1.18.  Round 148,422 to the nearest million. Since we are rounding to the nearest million, we'll have to imagine a digit in the millions position. We'll write 148,422 as 0,148,422. The digit immediately to the right is 1. Since 1 is less than 5, we'll round down by replacing it and all the digits to its right with zeros. 0,000,000 This number is 0. Thus, 148,422 rounded to the nearest million is 0. Example 1.19.  Round 397,000 to the nearest ten thousand. We are rounding to the nearest ten thousand. The digit immediately to the right of the ten thousand position is 7. Since 7 is greater than 5, we round up by replacing 7 and all the digits to its right with zeros and adding 1 to the digit in the ten thousands position. But 9 + 1 = 10 and we must carry the 1 to the next (the hundred thousands) position. 400,000 Thus, 397,000 rounded to the nearest ten thousand is 400,000.
