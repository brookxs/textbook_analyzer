4.2 Solving Systems by Substitution In this section we introduce an algebraic technique for solving systems of two equations in two unknowns called the substitution method. The substitution method is fairly straightforward to use. First, you solve either equation for either variable, then substitute the result into the other equation. The result is an equation in a single variable. Solve that equation, then substitute the result into any of the other equations to find the remaining unknown variable. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: 9x+ 2y = −19 y = 13 + 3x 2x− 5y = −8 (4.7) y = 3x− 1 (4.8) Solution: Equation (4.8) is already solved for y. Substitute equation (4.8) into equation (4.7). This means we will substitute 3x−1 for y in equation (4.7). 2x− 5y = −8 Equation (4.7). 2x− 5(3x− 1) = −8 Substitute 3x− 1 for y in (4.7). Now solve for x. 2x− 15x+ 5 = −8 Distribute −5. −13x+ 5 = −8 Simplify. −13x = −13 Subtract 5 from both sides. x = 1 Divide both sides by −13. As we saw in Solving Systems by Graphing, the solution to the system is the point of intersection of the two lines represented by the equations in the system. This means that we can substitute the answer x = 1 into either equation to find the corresponding value of y. We choose to substitute 1 for x in equation (4.8), then solve for y, but you will get exactly the same result if you substitute 1 for x in equation (4.7). −5 5 −5 5 x y 2x− 5y = −8 y = 3x− 1 (1, 2) Figure 4.27: 2x − 5y = −8 and y = x − 3 intersect at (1, 2). y = 3x− 1 Equation (4.8). y = 3(1)− 1 Substitute 1 for x. y = 2 Simplify. Hence, (x, y) = (1, 2) is the solution of the system. Check: To show that the solution (x, y) = (1, 2) is a solution of the system, we need to show that (x, y) = (1, 2) satisfies both equations (4.7) and (4.8). 4.2. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY SUBSTITUTION 263 Substitute (x, y) = (1, 2) in equa- tion (4.7): 2x− 5y = −8 2(1)− 5(2) = −8 2− 10 = −8 −8 = −8 Thus, (1, 2) satisfies equation (4.7). Substitute (x, y) = (1, 2) in equa- tion (4.8): y = 3x− 1 2 = 3(1)− 1 2 = 3− 1 2 = 2 Thus, (1, 2) satisfies equation (4.8). Because (x, y) = (1, 2) satisfies both equations, it is a solution of the system. Answer: (−3, 4) ! Substitution method. The substitution method involves these steps: 1. Solve either equation for either variable. 2. Substitute the result from step one into the other equation. Solve the resulting equation. 3. Substitute the result from step two into either of the original system equa- tions or the resulting equation from step one (whichever seems easiest), then solve to find the remaining unknown variable. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Solve the following system of equations: Solve the following system of equations: x− 2y = 13 4x− 3y = 26 5x− 2y = 12 (4.9) 4x+ y = 6 (4.10) Solution: The first step is to solve either equation for either variable. This means that we can solve the first equation for x or y, but it also means that we could first solve the second equation for x or y. Of these four possible choices, solving the second equation (4.10) for y seems the easiest way to start. 4x+ y = 6 Equation (4.10). y = 6− 4x Subtract 4x from both sides. 264 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS Next, substitute 6− 4x for y in equation (4.9). 5x− 2y = 12 Equation (4.9). 5x− 2(6− 4x) = 12 Substitute 6− 4x for y in (4.9). 5x− 12 + 8x = 12 Distribute −2. 13x− 12 = 12 Simplify. 13x = 24 Add 12 to both sides. x = 24 13 Divide both sides by 13. Finally, to find the y-value, substitute 24/13 for x in the equation y = 6 − 4x (you can also substitute 24/13 for x in equations (4.9) or (4.10)). y = 6− 4x y = 6− 4 ( 24 13 ) Substitute 24/13 for x in y = 6− 4x. y = 78 13 − 96 13 Multiply, then make equivalent fractions. y = −18 13 Simplify. Hence, (x, y) = (24/13,−18/13) is the solution of the system. −5 5 −5 5 x y 5x− 2y = 12 4x + y = 6 (24/13,−18/13) Figure 4.28: 5x − 2y = 12 and 4x + y = 6 intersect at (24/13,−18/13).

Note that each left-hand side produces the number on the right-hand sides of equations (4.9) and (4.10). Thus, the solution (x, y) = (24/13,−18/13) checks. 4.2.

SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS Substitute −3 + 32x for y in equation (4.12). 4x+ 5y = 20 Equation (4.12). 4x+ 5 ( −3 + 3 2 x ) = 20 Substitute −3 + 3 2 x for y. 4x− 15 + 15 2 x = 20 Distribute the 5. 8x− 30 + 15x = 40 Clear fractions by multiplying both sides by 2. 23x = 70 Simplify. Add 30 to both sides. x = 70 23 Divide both sides by 23. To find y, substitute 70/23 for x into equation y = −3 + 32x. You could also substitute 70/23 for x in equations (4.11) or (4.12) and get the same result. −5 5 −5 5 x y 3x− 2y = 6 4x + 5y = 20 (70/23, 36/23) Figure 4.31: 3x − 2y = 6 and 4x+ 5y = 20 intersect at (70/23, 36/23). y = −3 + 3 2 x y = −3 + 3 2 ( 70 23 ) Substitute 70/23 for x. y = −69 23 + 105 23 Multiply. Make equivalent fractions. y = 36 23 Simplify. Hence, (x, y) = (70/23, 36/23) is the solution of the system. Check: To check this solution, let’s use the graphing calculator to find the solution of the system. We already know that 3x − 2y = 6 is equivalent to y = −3 + 32x. Let’s also solve equation (4.12) for y. 4x+ 5y = 20 Equation (4.12). 5y = 20− 4x Subtract 4x from both sides. y = 20− 4x 5 Divide both sides by 5. y = 4− 4 5 x Divide both 20 and −4x by 5 using the distributive property.

Substitute equation (4.8) into equation (4.7). This means we will substitute 3x−1 for y in equation (4.7). 2x− 5y = −8 Equation (4.7). 2x− 5(3x− 1) = −8 Substitute 3x− 1 for y in (4.7). Now solve for x. 2x− 15x+ 5 = −8 Distribute −5. −13x+ 5 = −8 Simplify. −13x = −13 Subtract 5 from both sides. x = 1 Divide both sides by −13. As we saw in Solving Systems by Graphing, the solution to the system is the point of intersection of the two lines represented by the equations in the system. This means that we can substitute the answer x = 1 into either equation to find the corresponding value of y.

Hence, (x, y) = (1, 2) is the solution of the system. Check: To show that the solution (x, y) = (1, 2) is a solution of the system, we need to show that (x, y) = (1, 2) satisfies both equations (4.7) and (4.8). 4.2. SOLVING SYSTEMS BY SUBSTITUTION 263 Substitute (x, y) = (1, 2) in equa- tion (4.7): 2x− 5y = −8 2(1)− 5(2) = −8 2− 10 = −8 −8 = −8 Thus, (1, 2) satisfies equation (4.7).

SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS  || Exceptional Cases Revisited It is entirely possible that you might apply the substitution method to a system of equations that either have an infinite number of solutions or no solutions at all. Let’s see what happens should you do that. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve the following system of equations:Solve the following system of equations: x = 4 3 y − 7 6x− 8y = −3 2x+ 3y = 6 (4.13) y = −2 3 x+ 4 (4.14) Solution: Equation (4.14) is already solved for y, so let’s substitute − 23x+ 4 for y in equation (4.13). 2x+ 3y = 6 Equation (4.13). 2x+ 3 ( −2 3 x+ 4 ) = 6 Substitute −2 3 x+ 4 for y. 2x− 2x+ 12 = 6 Distribute the 3. 12 = 6 Simplify. Goodness! What happened to the x? How are we supposed to solve for x in this situation? However, note that the resulting statement, 12 = 6, is false, no matter what we use for x and y. This should give us a clue that there are no solutions. Perhaps we are dealing with parallel lines? Let’s solve equation (4.13) for y, putting the equation into slope-intercept form, to help determine the situation. 2x+ 3y = 6 Equation (4.13). 3y = −2x+ 6 Subtract 2x from both sides. y = −2 3 x+ 2 Divide both sides by 3. Thus, our system is equivalent to the following two equations. −5 5 −5 5 x y 2x + 3y = 6 y = − 2 3 x + 4 Figure 4.36: 2x+ 3y = 6 and y = − 23x+ 4 are parallel.

Goodness! What happened to the x? How are we supposed to solve for x in this situation? However, note that the resulting statement, −8 = −8, is a true statement this time. Perhaps this is an indication that we are dealing with the same line? Let’s put both equations (4.17) and (4.18) into slope-intercept form so that we can compare them. −5 5 −5 5 x y x = 3y − 4 2x− 6y = −8 (−4, 0) (−1, 1) (2, 2) Figure 4.37: 2x − 6y = −8 and x = 3y − 4 are the same line.

Thus, there are an infinite number of solutions. Indeed, any point on either line is a solution. Examples of solution points are (−4, 0), (−1, 1), and (2, 2). Answer: There are an infinite number of solutions. Examples of solution points are (0,−9), (5, 1), and (−3,−15). ! Tip. When you substitute one equation into another and the variable disap- pears, consider: 1. If the resulting statement is false, then you have two distinct parallel lines and there is no solution. 2. If the resulting statement is true, then you have the same lines and there are an infinite number of solutions. 270 CHAPTER 4. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS ! ! !  ||
