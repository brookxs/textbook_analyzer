Multiplying Decimals by Powers of 10 There is an interesting feature of multiplying decimals by powers of 10. Consider the following multiplications. Table 6.21. Multiplication Number of Zeros in the Power of 10 Number of Positions the Decimal Point Has Been Moved to the Right 10 ⋅ 8 . 315274 = 83 . 15274 1 1 100 ⋅ 8 . 315274 = 831 . 5274 2 2 1, 000 ⋅ 8 . 315274 = 8, 315 . 274 3 3 10 , 000 ⋅ 8 . 315274 = 83 , 152 . 74 4 4 Multiplying a Decimal by a Power of 10 To multiply a decimal by a power of 10, move the decimal place to the right of its current position as many places as there are zeros in the power of 10. Add zeros if necessary. Sample Set C Find the following products. Example 6.37.  100⋅34.876. Since there are 2 zeros in 100, Move the decimal point in 34.876 two places to the right. Example 6.38.  1,000⋅4.8058. Since there are 3 zeros in 1,000, move the decimal point in 4.8058 three places to the right. Example 6.39.  10,000⋅56.82. Since there are 4 zeros in 10,000, move the decimal point in 56.82 four places to the right. We will have to add two zeros in order to obtain the four places. Since there is no fractional part, we can drop the decimal point. Example 6.40.  Example 6.41.  Practice Set C Find the following products. Exercise 6.6.14. (Go to Solution) 100 ⋅ 4.27 Exercise 6.6.15. (Go to Solution) 10,000 ⋅ 16.52187 Exercise 6.6.16. (Go to Solution) (10)(0.0188) Exercise 6.6.17. (Go to Solution) (10,000,000,000)(52.7) Multiplying Decimals by Powers of 10 There is an interesting feature of multiplying decimals by powers of 10. Consider the following multiplications.
