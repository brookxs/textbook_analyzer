 ||  || Variables and Constants A basic distinction between algebra and arithmetic is the use of symbols (usually letters) in algebra to represent numbers. So, algebra is a generalization of arithme­tic. Let us look at two examples of situations in which letters are substituted for numbers: Suppose that a student is taking four college classes, and each class can have at most 1 exam per week. In any 1-week period, the student may have 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 exams. In algebra, we can let the letter x represent the number of exams this student may have in a 1-week period. The letter x may assume any of the various values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Suppose that in writing a term paper for a biology class a student needs to specify the average lifetime, in days, of a male housefly. If she does not know this number off the top of her head, she might represent it (at least temporarily) on her paper with the letter t (which reminds her of time). Later, she could look up the average time in a reference book and find it to be 17 days. The letter t can assume only the one value, 17, and no other values. The value t is constant. Variable, Constant A letter or symbol that represents any member of a collection of two or more numbers is called a variable. A letter or symbol that represents one specific number, known or unknown, is called a constant. In example 1, the letter x is a variable since it can represent any of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The letter t example 2 is a constant since it can only have the value 17.  || Real Numbers Real Number Line The study of mathematics requires the use of several collections of numbers. The real number line allows us to visually display (graph) the numbers in which we are interested. A line is composed of infinitely many points. To each point we can associate a unique number, and with each number, we can associate a particular point. Coordinate The number associated with a point on the number line is called the coordinate of the point. Graph The point on a number line that is associated with a particular number is called the graph of that number. Constructing a Real Number Line We construct a real number line as follows: Draw a horizontal line. Origin Choose any point on the line and label it 0. This point is called the origin. Choose a convenient length. Starting at 0, mark this length off in both direc­tions, being careful to have the lengths look like they are about the same. We now define a real number. Real Number A real number is any number that is the coordinate of a point on the real number line. Positive Numbers, Negative Numbers Real numbers whose graphs are to the right of 0 are called positive real numbers, or more simply, positive numbers. Real numbers whose graphs appear to the left of 0 are called negative real numbers, or more simply, negative numbers. The number 0 is neither positive nor negative.  || Subsets of Real Numbers The set of real numbers has many subsets. Some of the subsets that are of interest in the study of algebra are listed below along with their notations and graphs. Natural Numbers, Counting Numbers The natural or counting numbers ( N ): 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . Read “and so on.” Whole Numbers The whole numbers ( W ): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . Notice that every natural number is a whole number. Integers The integers ( Z ): . . . -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . Notice that every whole number is an integer. Rational Numbers (Fractions) The rational numbers ( Q ): Rational numbers are sometimes called fractions. They are numbers that can be written as the quotient of two integers. They have decimal representations that either terminate or do not terminate but contain a repeating block of digits. Some examples are       Some rational numbers are graphed below. Notice that every integer is a rational number. Notice that there are still a great many points on the number line that have not yet been assigned a type of number. We will not examine these other types of numbers in this text. They are examined in detail in algebra. An example of these numbers is the number π , whose decimal representation does not terminate nor contain a repeating block of digits. An approximation for π is 3.14. Sample Set A Example 10.1.  Is every whole number a natural number? No. The number 0 is a whole number but it is not a natural number. Example 10.2.  Is there an integer that is not a natural number? Yes. Some examples are 0, -1, -2, -3, and -4. Example 10.3.  Is there an integer that is a whole number? Yes. In fact, every whole number is an integer. Practice Set A Exercise 10.2.1. (Go to Solution) Is every natural number a whole number? Exercise 10.2.2. (Go to Solution) Is every whole number an integer? Exercise 10.2.3. (Go to Solution) Is every integer a real number? Exercise 10.2.4. (Go to Solution) Is there an integer that is a whole number? Exercise 10.2.5. (Go to Solution) Is there an integer that is not a natural number?  || Ordering Real Numbers Ordering Real Numbers A real number b is said to be greater than a real number a , denoted b > a , if b is to the right of a on the number line. Thus, as we would expect, 5 > 2 since 5 is to the right of 2 on the number line. Also, – 2 > – 5 since -2 is to the right of -5 on the number line. If we let a and b represent two numbers, then a and b are related in exactly one of three ways: Either Equality Symbol Inequality Symbols Sample Set B Example 10.4.  What integers can replace x so that the following statement is true? – 3 ≤ x < 2 The integers are -3, -2, -1, 0, 1. Example 10.5.  Draw a number line that extends from -3 to 5. Place points at all whole numbers between and including -1 and 3. -1 is not a whole number Practice Set B Exercise 10.2.6. (Go to Solution) What integers can replace x so that the following statement is true? – 5 ≤ x < 2 Exercise 10.2.7. (Go to Solution) Draw a number line that extends from -4 to 3. Place points at all natural numbers between, but not including, -2 to 2.  ||  || Positive and Negative Numbers Positive and Negative Numbers Each real number other than zero has a sign associated with it. A real number is said to be a positive number if it is to the right of 0 on the number line and negative if it is to the left of 0 on the number line. THE NOTATION OF SIGNED NUMBERS + and – Notation A number is denoted as positive if it is directly preceded by a plus sign or no sign at all. A number is denoted as negative if it is directly preceded by a minus sign.  || Reading Signed Numbers The plus and minus signs now have two meanings: The plus sign can denote the operation of addition or a positive number. The minus sign can denote the operation of subtraction or a negative number. To avoid any confusion between "sign" and "operation," it is preferable to read the sign of a number as "positive" or "negative." When "+" is used as an operation sign, it is read as "plus." When " – " is used as an operation sign, it is read as "minus." Sample Set A Read each expression so as to avoid confusion between "operation" and "sign." Example 10.6.  – 8 should be read as "negative eight" rather than "minus eight." Example 10.7.  4 + ( – 2) should be read as "four plus negative two" rather than "four plus minus two." Example 10.8.  – 6 + ( – 3)should be read as "negative six plus negative three" rather than "minus six plus minus three." Example 10.9.  – 15 – ( – 6)should be read as "negative fifteen minus negative six" rather than "minus fifteen minus minus six." Example 10.10.  – 5 + 7 should be read as "negative five plus seven" rather than "minus five plus seven." Example 10.11.  0 – 2 should be read as "zero minus two." Practice Set A Write each expression in words. Exercise 10.3.1. (Go to Solution) 6 + 1 Exercise 10.3.2. (Go to Solution) 2 + ( – 8) Exercise 10.3.3. (Go to Solution) – 7 + 5 Exercise 10.3.4. (Go to Solution) – 10 – ( + 3) Exercise 10.3.5. (Go to Solution) – 1 – ( – 8) Exercise 10.3.6. (Go to Solution) 0 + ( – 11)  || Opposites Opposites On the number line, each real number, other than zero, has an image on the opposite side of 0. For this reason, we say that each real number has an opposite. Opposites are the same distance from zero but have opposite signs. The opposite of a real number is denoted by placing a negative sign directly in front of the number. Thus, if a is any real number, then − a is its opposite. Note The letter " a " is a variable. Thus, " a " need not be positive, and " – a " need not be negative. If a is any real number, − a is opposite a on the number line.  || The Double-Negative Property The number a is opposite − a on the number line. Therefore, − ( − a) is opposite − a on the number line. This means that − ( − a ) = a From this property of opposites, we can suggest the double-negative property for real numbers. Double-Negative Property: − ( − a) = a If a is a real number, then − ( − a ) = a Sample Set B Find the opposite of each number. Example 10.12.  If a = 2, then – a = – 2. Also, − ( − a) = − ( − 2) = 2. Example 10.13.  If a = – 4, then – a = – ( – 4) = 4. Also, – ( – a) = a = – 4. Practice Set B Find the opposite of each number. Exercise 10.3.7.

Is − a positive or negative? Exercise 10.3.15. (Go to Solution) Suppose we do not know the sign of the number k . Is − k positive, negative, or do we not know?  ||  || Geometric Definition of Absolute Value Absolute Value-Geometric Approach Geometric definition of absolute value: The absolute value of a number a , denoted ∣ a ∣ , is the distance from a to 0 on the number line. Absolute value answers the question of "how far," and not "which way." The phrase "how far" implies "length" and length is always a nonnegative quantity. Thus, the absolute value of a number is a nonnegative number. Sample Set A Determine each value. Example 10.14.  ∣ 4 ∣ = 4 Example 10.15.  ∣ − 4 ∣ = 4 Example 10.16.  ∣ 0 ∣ = 0 Example 10.17.  − ∣ 5 ∣ = − 5. The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as "negative the absolute value of 5." The absolute value of 5 is 5. Hence, negative the absolute value of 5 is -5. Example 10.18.  − ∣ − 3 ∣ = − 3. The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as "negative the absolute value of -3." The absolute value of -3 is 3. Hence, negative the absolute value of -3 is – ( 3 ) = – 3 . Practice Set A By reasoning geometrically, determine each absolute value. Exercise 10.4.1. (Go to Solution) ∣ 7 ∣ Exercise 10.4.2. (Go to Solution) ∣ − 3 ∣ Exercise 10.4.3. (Go to Solution) ∣ 12 ∣ Exercise 10.4.4. (Go to Solution) ∣ 0 ∣ Exercise 10.4.5. (Go to Solution) − ∣ 9 ∣ Exercise 10.4.6. (Go to Solution) − ∣ − 6 ∣  || Algebraic Definition of Absolute Value From the problems in the section called “Sample Set A”, we can suggest the following algebraic defini­tion of absolute value. Note that the definition has two parts. Absolute Value—Algebraic Approach Algebraic definition of absolute value The absolute value of a number a is The algebraic definition takes into account the fact that the number a could be either positive or zero (a ≥ 0) or negative (a < 0). If the number a is positive or zero (a ≥ 0), the upper part of the definition applies. The upper part of the definition tells us that if the number enclosed in the absolute value bars is a nonnegative number, the absolute value of the number is the number itself. The lower part of the definition tells us that if the number enclosed within the absolute value bars is a negative number, the absolute value of the number is the opposite of the number. The opposite of a negative number is a positive number. Note The definition says that the vertical absolute value lines may be elimi­nated only if we know whether the number inside is positive or negative. Sample Set B Use the algebraic definition of absolute value to find the following values. Example 10.19.  ∣ 8 ∣ . The number enclosed within the absolute value bars is a nonnegative number, so the upper part of the definition applies. This part says that the absolute value of 8 is 8 itself. ∣ 8 ∣ = 8 Example 10.20.  ∣ − 3 ∣ . The number enclosed within absolute value bars is a negative number, so the lower part of the definition applies. This part says that the absolute value of -3 is the opposite of -3, which is − ( − 3). By the definition of absolute value and the double-negative property, ∣ − 3 ∣ = − ( − 3 ) = 3 Practice Set B Use the algebraic definition of absolute value to find the following values. Exercise 10.4.7. (Go to Solution) ∣ 7 ∣ Exercise 10.4.8. (Go to Solution) ∣ 9 ∣ Exercise 10.4.9. (Go to Solution) ∣ − 12 ∣ Exercise 10.4.10. (Go to Solution) ∣ − 5 ∣ Exercise 10.4.11.

(Go to Solution) − ∣ − 31 ∣  ||  || Addition of Numbers with Like Signs The addition of the two positive numbers 2 and 3 is performed on the number line as follows. Begin at 0, the origin. Since 2 is positive, move 2 units to the right. Since 3 is positive, move 3 more units to the right. We are now located at 5. Thus, 2 + 3 = 5. Summarizing, we have ( 2 positive units ) + ( 3 positive units ) = ( 5 positive units ) The addition of the two negative numbers -2 and -3 is performed on the number line as follows. Begin at 0, the origin. Since -2 is negative, move 2 units to the left. Since -3 is negative, move 3 more units to the left. We are now located at -5. Thus, ( − 2) + ( − 3) = − 5. Summarizing, we have ( 2 negative units ) + ( 3 negative units ) = ( 5 negative units ) Observing these two examples, we can suggest these relationships: ( positive number ) + ( positive number ) = ( positive number ) ( negative number ) + ( negative number ) = ( negative number ) Adding Numbers with the Same Sign Addition of numbers with like sign: To add two real numbers that have the same sign, add the absolute values of the numbers and associate with the sum the common sign. Sample Set A Find the sums. Example 10.21.  3 + 7 Add these absolute values. 3 + 7 = 10 The common sign is “+.” Thus, 3 + 7 = + 10, or 3 + 7 = 10. Example 10.22.  ( − 4) + ( − 9) Add these absolute values. 4 + 9 = 13 The common sign is “ – .“ Thus, ( − 4) + ( − 9) = − 13. Practice Set A Find the sums. Exercise 10.5.1. (Go to Solution) 8 + 6 Exercise 10.5.2. (Go to Solution) 41 + 11 Exercise 10.5.3. (Go to Solution) ( – 4) + ( – 8) Exercise 10.5.4. (Go to Solution) ( − 36) + ( − 9) Exercise 10.5.5.

(Go to Solution) 0 + ( − 16)  || Addition With Zero Addition with Zero Notice that (0) + (a positive number) = (that same positive number). (0) + (a negative number) = (that same negative number). The Additive Identity Is Zero Since adding zero to a real number leaves that number unchanged, zero is called the additive identity.  || Addition of Numbers with Unlike Signs The addition 2 + ( – 6), two numbers with unlike signs, can also be illustrated using the number line. Begin at 0, the origin. Since 2 is positive, move 2 units to the right. Since -6 is negative, move, from 2, 6 units to the left. We are now located at -4. We can suggest a rule for adding two numbers that have unlike signs by noting that if the signs are disregarded, 4 can be obtained by subtracting 2 from 6. But 2 and 6 are precisely the absolute values of 2 and -6. Also, notice that the sign of the number with the larger absolute value is negative and that the sign of the resulting sum is negative. Adding Numbers with Unlike Signs Addition of numbers with unlike signs: To add two real numbers that have unlike signs, subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and associate with this difference the sign of the number with the larger absolute value. Sample Set B Find the following sums. Example 10.23.  7 + ( – 2)       Subtract absolute values: 7 – 2 = 5. Attach the proper sign: "+." Thus, 7 + ( – 2) = + 5 or 7 + ( – 2) = 5. Example 10.24.  3 + ( – 11 )       Subtract absolute values: 11 – 3 = 8. Attach the proper sign: " – ." Thus, 3 + ( – 11) = – 8. Example 10.25.  The morning temperature on a winter's day in Lake Tahoe was -12 degrees. The afternoon temperature was 25 degrees warmer. What was the afternoon temperature? We need to find – 12 + 25.       Subtract absolute values: 25 – 12 = 16. Attach the proper sign: "+." Thus, – 12 + 25 = 13. Practice Set B Find the sums. Exercise 10.5.9.

We can suggest a rule for subtracting signed numbers by illus­trating this process on the number line. Begin at 0, the origin. Since 5 is positive, move 5 units to the right. Then, move 2 units to the left to get to 6. (This reminds us of addition with a negative number.) From this illustration we can see that 5 – 2 is the same as 5 + ( – 2). This leads us directly to the definition of subtraction. Definition of Subtraction If a and b are real numbers, a – b is the same as a + ( – b), where – b is the opposite of b .  || The Process of Subtraction From this definition, we suggest the following rule for subtracting signed numbers. Subtraction of Signed Numbers To perform the subtraction a – b , add the opposite of b to a , that is, change the sign of b and add. Sample Set A Perform the indicated subtractions.

The low temperature tonight is expected to be -7°F. How many degrees is the temperature expected to drop? We need to find the difference between 26 and -7. 26 – ( – 7 ) = 26 + 7 = 33 Thus, the expected temperature drop is 33°F. Example 10.32.  Practice Set A Perform the indicated subtractions.

Multiply: 3 ⋅ 5. 3 ⋅ 5 means 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 This suggests[1] that ( positive number ) ⋅ ( positive number ) = ( positive number ) More briefly, ( + ) ( + ) = ( + ) Now consider the product of a positive number and a negative number. Multiply: (3)( − 5). (3)( − 5) means ( − 5) + ( − 5) + ( − 5) = − 15 This suggests that ( positive number ) ⋅ ( negative number ) = ( negative number ) More briefly, ( + ) ( – ) = ( – ) By the commutative property of multiplication, we get ( negative number ) ⋅ ( positive number ) = ( negative number ) More briefly, ( − ) ( + ) = ( − ) The sign of the product of two negative numbers can be suggested after observing the following illustration. Multiply -2 by, respectively, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -4. We have the following rules for multiplying signed numbers. Rules for Multiplying Signed Numbers Multiplying signed numbers: To multiply two real numbers that have the same sign, multiply their absolute values. The product is positive. ( + ) ( + ) = ( + ) ( − ) ( − ) = ( + ) To multiply two real numbers that have opposite signs, multiply their abso­lute values. The product is negative.

Example 10.35.  8 ⋅ 6 Multiply these absolute values. 8 ⋅ 6 = 48 Since the numbers have the same sign, the product is positive. Thus, 8⋅6=+48, or 8⋅6 = 48. Example 10.36.  ( − 8)( − 6) Multiply these absolute values. 8 ⋅ 6 = 48 Since the numbers have the same sign, the product is positive. Thus, ( − 8)( − 6)=+48, or ( − 8)( − 6) = 48. Example 10.37.  ( − 4)(7) Multiply these absolute values. 4 ⋅ 7 = 28 Since the numbers have opposite signs, the product is negative. Thus, ( − 4)(7) = − 28.
