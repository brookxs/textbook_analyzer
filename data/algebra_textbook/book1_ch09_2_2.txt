Square Roots When we studied exponents in Section Section 2.5, we noted that 42 = 16 and ( − 4 ) 2 = 16. We can see that 16 is the square of both 4 and − 4 . Since 16 comes from squaring 4 or − 4 , 4 and − 4 are called the square roots of 16. Thus 16 has two square roots, 4 and − 4 . Notice that these two square roots are opposites of each other. We can say that Square Root The square root of a positive number x is a number such that when it is squared the number x results. Every positive number has two square roots, one positive square root and one negative square root. Furthermore, the two square roots of a positive number are opposites of each other. The square root of 0 is 0. Square Roots When we studied exponents in Section Section 2.5, we noted that 42 = 16 and ( − 4 ) 2 = 16. We can see that 16 is the square of both 4 and − 4 .
