The Collect and Discard Method of Factoring a x 2 + b x + c Collect and Discard Method Consider the polynomial 6x 2 + x − 12 . We begin by identifying a and c . In this case, a = 6 and c = − 12 . We start out as we would with a = 1 .Now, compute a⋅c . a⋅c = (6)( − 12) = − 72 Find the factors of − 72 that add to 1, the coefficient of x , the linear term. The factors are 9 and − 8 . Include these factors in the parentheses. 6x 2 + x − 12 :   (6x + 9)(6x − 8) But we have included too much. We must eliminate the surplus. Factor each parentheses. 6x 2 + x − 12 :   3(2x + 3)⋅2(3x − 4) Discard the factors that multiply to a = 6 . In this case, 3 and 2. We are left with the proper factorization. 6x 2 + x − 12 = (2x + 3)(3x − 4) The Collect and Discard Method of Factoring a x 2 + b x + c Collect and Discard Method Consider the polynomial 6x 2 + x − 12 .
