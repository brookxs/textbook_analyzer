Solving Rational Equations with the Graphing Calculator Let’s use the graphing calculator to solve an equation containing rational ex- pressions. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Consider the following equation:Solve the equation 2 + 5 x = 12 x2 both algebraically and graphically, then compare your solutions. 2− 9 x = 5 x2 Solve the equation algebraically, then solve the equation graphically using your graphing calculator. Compare your solutions. 7.4. SOLVING RATIONAL EQUATIONS 519 Algebraic solution: First, an algebraic approach. Multiply both sides of the equation by the common denominator x2. 2− 9 x = 5 x2 Original equation. x2 [ 2− 9 x ] = [ 5 x2 ] x2 Multiply both sides by x2. x2 [2]− x2 [ 9 x ] = [ 5 x2 ] x2 Distribute x2. 2x2 − 9x = 5 Cancel and simplify. The last equation is nonlinear. Make one side zero. 2x2 − 9x− 5 = 0 Make one side zero. The integer pair −10 and 1 have product equaling ac = −10 and sum equaling b = −9. Break up the middle term using this pair, then factor by grouping. 2x2 − 10x+ x− 5 = 0 −10x+ x = −9x. 2x(x− 5) + 1(x− 5) = 0 Factor by grouping. (2x+ 1)(x− 5) = 0 Factor out x− 5. Now use the zero product property to write: 2x+ 1 = 0 or x− 5 = 0 2x = −1 x = 5 x = −1 2 Hence, the solutions are x = −1/2 and x = 5. Graphical solution: We could load each side of the equation separately, then use the intersect utility to find where the graphs intersect. However, in this case, it’s a bit easier to make one side of the equation zero, draw a single graph, then note where the graph crosses the x-axis. 2− 9 x = 5 x2 Original equation. 2− 9 x − 5 x2 = 0 Make one side zero. Load the left-hand side of the equation into Y1 as 2-9/X-5/X∧2 (see the image on the left in Figure 7.8), then select 6:ZStandard from the ZOOM menu to produce the image at the right in Figure 7.8. Next, the solutions of 2− 9 x − 5 x2 = 0 520 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS Figure 7.8: Sketch the graph of y = 2− 9 x − 5 x2 . are found by noting where the graph of y = 2 − 9/x − 5/x2 cross the x-axis. Select 2:zero from the CALC menu. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the left of the first x-intercept, then press ENTER to set the “Left bound.” Next, move the cursor to the right of the first x-intercept, then press ENTER to set the “Right bound.” Finally, leave the cursor where it is and press ENTER to set your “Guess.” The calculator responds with the result shown in the figure on the left in Figure 7.9. Repeat the zero-finding procedure to capture the coordinates of the second x-intercept (see the image on the right in Figure 7.9). Figure 7.9: Locating the zeros of y = 2− 9 x − 5 x2 . Reporting the solution on your homework: Duplicate the image in your calculator’s viewing window on your homework page. Use a ruler to draw all lines, but freehand any curves. • Label the horizontal and vertical axes with x and y, respectively (see Figure 7.10). • Place yourWINDOW parameters at the end of each axis (see Figure 7.10). • Label the graph with its equation (see Figure 7.10). • Drop dashed vertical lines through each x-intercept. Shade and label the x-values of the points where the dashed vertical line crosses the x- axis. These are the solutions of the equation 2 − 9/x − 5/x2 = 0 (see Figure 7.10). 7.4.
