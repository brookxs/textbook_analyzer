The Quotient Property of Square Roots We can suggest a similar rule for quotients. Notice that      and Since both and equal 3, it must be that The Quotient Property This suggests that in general, if x and y are positive real numbers,      y ≠ 0 The square root of the quotient is the quotient of the square roots. CAUTIONIt is extremely important to remember that For example, notice that but We shall study the process of simplifying a square root expression by distinguishing between two types of square roots: square roots not involving a fraction and square roots involving a fraction.
