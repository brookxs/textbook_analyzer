8.1 Introduction to Radical Notation We know how to square a number. For example: • 52 = 25 • (−5)2 = 25 Taking the square root of a number is the opposite of squaring. • The nonnegative square root of 25 is 5. • The negative square root of 25 is −5. Thus, when searching for a square root of a number, we are searching for number whose square is equal to our number. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Find the square roots of 81.Find the square roots of 64. Solution: We are looking for a number whose square is 81. • Because 92 = 81, the nonnegative square root of 81 is 9. • Because (−9)2 = 81, the negative square root of 81 is −9.

INTRODUCTION TO RADICAL NOTATION 537 Solution: We are looking for a number whose square is −36. However, every time you square a real number, the result is never negative.

The solutions of x2 = a are called square roots of a. Case: a > 0. The equation x2 = a has two real solutions, namely x = ±√a. • The notation √a calls for the nonegative square root. • The notation −√a calls for the negative square root. Case: a = 0. The equation x2 = 0 has exactly one solution, namely x = 0. Case: a < 0. The equation x2 = a has no real solutions. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve x2 = 9 for x, then simplify your answers. Solve x2 = 16 for x, then simplify your answers. Solution: Because the right-hand side of x2 = 9 is positive, the equation has two solutions. x2 = 9 Original equation. x = ±√9 Two answers: −√9 and √9 To simplify these answers, we need to understand the following facts: • √9 calls for the nonnegative square root of 9. Because (3)2 = 9, the nonnegative square root of 9 is 3. Hence, √ 9 = 3. • −√9 calls for the negative square root of 9. Because (−3)2 = 9, the negative square root of 9 is −3. Hence, −√9 = −3. Thus, the solutions of x2 = 9 are x = ±3, which is equivalent to saying “x = −3 or x = 3.” Answer: 4, −4 ! 1When we say that −36 has no real square roots, we mean there are no real numbers that are square roots of −36. The reason we emphasize the word real in this situation is the fact that −36 does have two square roots that are elements of the complex numbers, a set of numbers that are usually introduced in advanced courses such as college algebra or trigonometry. 538 CHAPTER 8.

Answer: 21 !  || Using the Graphing Calculator Up to this point, the equation x2 = a has involved perfect squares. For exam- ple, if we start with x2 = 25, then the solutions are x = ±√25. Because 25 is a perfect square, we can simplify further, arriving at x = ±5. However, the right-hand side of x2 = a does not have to be a perfect square. For example, the equation x2 = 7 has two real solutions, x = ±√7. Because 7 is not a perfect square, we cannot simplify further. In the next example, we’ll use the graphing calculator to compare this algebraic solution with a graphical solution and hopefully provide some assurance that −√7 and √7 are perfectly valid solutions of x2 = 7. 540 CHAPTER 8.

Use the 5:intersect utility on the CALC menu to find the points of intersec- tion. Press ENTER in response to “First curve,” press ENTER in response to “Second curve,” then use the arrow keys to move the cursor closer to the point of intersection on the left than the one on the right. Press ENTER in response to “Guess.” This will produce the point of intersection shown in image on the left in Figure 8.2. Repeat the procedure to find the point of intersection in the image on the right in Figure 8.2. Figure 8.2: Finding points of intersection.

Because there are no points of intersection, the graph in Figure 8.6 informs us that the equation x2 = −5 has no real solutions. Now we solve the equation algebraically. x2 = −5 However, you cannot square a real number and get a negative answer. Hence, the equation x2 = −5 has no real solutions. This agrees completely with the graph in Figure 8.6. !  || Approximating Square Roots The squares in the “List of Squares” shown in Table 8.1 are called perfect squares. Each is the square of a whole number. But not all numbers are perfect squares. For example, in the case of √ 24, there is no whole number whose square is equal to 24. However, this does not prevent √ 24 from being a perfectly good number. 8.1.

As a check, let’s square 4.8. (4.8)2 = (4.8)(4.8) = 23.04 Not quite 24! Clearly, √ 24 must be a little bit bigger than 4.8. Let’s use a scientific calculator to get a better approximation. From our calculator, using the square root button, we find √ 24 ≈ 4.89897948557. 544 CHAPTER 8. QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS Even though this is better than our estimate of 4.8, it is still only an ap- proximation. Our calculator was only capable of providing 11 decimal places. However, the exact decimal representation of √ 24 is an infinite decimal that never terminates and never establishes a pattern of repetition. Just for fun, here is a decimal approximation of √ 24 that is accurate to 1000 places, courtesy of http://www.wolframalpha.com/. 4.8989794855663561963945681494117827839318949613133402568653851 3450192075491463005307971886620928046963718920245322837824971773 09196755146832515679024745571056578254950553531424952602105418235 40446962621357973381707264886705091208067617617878749171135693149 44872260828854054043234840367660016317961567602617940145738798726 16743161888016008874773750983290293078782900240894528962666325870 21889483627026570990088932343453262850995296636249008023132090729 18018687172335863967331332533818263813071727532210516312358732472 35822058934417670915102576710597966482011173804100128309322482347 06798820862115985796934679065105574720836593103436607820735600767 24633259464660565809954782094852720141025275395093777354012819859 11851434656929005776183028851492605205905926474151050068455119830 90852562596006129344159884850604575685241068135895720093193879959 87119508123342717309306912496416512553772738561882612744867017729 60314496926744648947590909762887695867274018394820295570465751182 126319692156620734019070649453 If you were to multiply this number by itself (square the number), you would get a number that is extremely close to 24, but it would not be exactly 24.
