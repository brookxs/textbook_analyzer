Conversion from One Unit to Another Unit Let's note three characteristics of the metric system that occur in the metric table of measurements. In each category, the prefixes are the same. We can move from a larger to a smaller unit of measure by moving the decimal point to the right. We can move from a smaller to a larger unit of measure by moving the decimal point to the left. The following table provides a summary of the relationship between the basic unit of measure (meter, gram, liter) and each prefix, and how many places the decimal point is moved and in what direction. kilo hecto deka unit deci centi milli Table 9.3.
