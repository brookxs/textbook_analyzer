Factor Out the GCF In Chapter 5, we multiplied a monomial and polynomial by distributing the monomial times each term in the polynomial. 2x(3x2 + 4x− 7) = 2x · 3x2 + 2x · 4x− 2x · 7 = 6x3 + 8x2 − 14x In this section we reverse that multiplication process. We present you with the final product and ask you to bring back the original multiplication problem. In the case 6x3 + 8x2 − 14x, the greatest common factor of 6x3, 8x2, and 14x is 2x. We then use the distributive property to factor out 2x from each term of the polynomial. 6x3 + 8x2 − 14x = 2x · 3x2 + 2x · 4x− 2x · 7 = 2x(3x2 + 4x− 7) Factoring. Factoring is “unmultiplying.” You are given the product, then asked to find the original multiplication problem. First rule of factoring. If the terms of the given polynomial have a greatest common factor (GCF), then factor out the GCF. Let’s look at a few examples that factor out the GCF. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Factor: 6x2 + 10x+ 14Factor: 9y2 − 15y + 12 6.1. THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR 391 Solution: The greatest common factor (GCF) of 6x2, 10x and 14 is 2. Factor out the GCF. 6x2 + 10x+ 14 = 2 · 3x2 + 2 · 5x+ 2 · 7 = 2(3x2 + 5x+ 7) Checking your work. Every time you factor a polynomial, remultiply to check your work. Check: Multiply. Distribute the 2. 2(3x2 + 5x+ 7) = 2 · 3x2 + 2 · 5x+ 2 · 7 = 6x2 + 10x+ 14 That’s the original polynomial, so we factored correctly. Answer: 3(3y2 − 5y + 4) ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Factor: 12y5 − 32y4 + 8y2 Factor: 8x6 + 20x4 − 24x3 Solution: The greatest common factor (GCF) of 12y5, 32y4 and 8y2 is 4y2. Factor out the GCF. 12y5 − 32y4 + 8y2 = 4y2 · 3y3 − 4y2 · 8y2 + 4y2 · 2 = 4y2(3y3 − 8y2 + 2) Check: Multiply. Distribute the monomial 4y2. 4y2(3y3 − 8y2 + 2) = 4y2 · 3y3 − 4y2 · 8y2 + 4y2 · 2 = 12y5 − 32y4 + 8y2 That’s the original polynomial. We have factored correctly. Answer: 4x3(2x3 + 5x− 6) !

Factor out the GCF. 12a3b+ 24a2b2 + 12ab3 = 12ab · a2 − 12ab · 2ab+ 12ab · b2 = 12ab(a2 + 2ab+ b2) 392 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING Check: Multiply. Distribute the monomial 12ab. 12ab(a2 + 2ab+ b2) = 12ab · a2 − 12ab · 2ab+ 12ab · b2 = 12a3b+ 24a2b2 + 12ab3 That’s the original polynomial. We have factored correctly.Answer: 3s2t2(5t2 + 2s+ 3) !
