Derivation Of The Quadratic Formula Solve a x 2 + b x + c = 0 for x by completing the square. Example 10.39.  Subtract c from both sides. a x 2 + b x = − c Example 10.40.  Divide both sides by a, the coefficient of x 2 . Example 10.41.  Now we have the proper form to complete the square. Take one half the coefficient of x, square it, and add the result to both sides of the equation found in step 2.(a) is one half the coefficient of x. (b) is the square of one half the coefficient of x. Example 10.42.  The left side of the equation is now a perfect square trinomial and can be factored. This gives us Example 10.43.  Add the two fractions on the right side of the equation. The LCD = 4a 2 . Example 10.44.  Solve for x using the method of extraction of roots.
