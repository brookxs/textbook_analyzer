Equivalent Equations Now that we know how to identify a solution of an equation, let’s define what it means when we say that two equations are equivalent. 2.1. SOLVING EQUATIONS: ONE STEP 75 Equivalent Equations. Two equations are equivalent if they have the same solution set. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Are the equations x− 3 = 6 and x = 9 equivalent? Are the equations x = 5 and x− 7 = 10 equivalent? Solution. The number 9 is the only solution of the equation x − 3 = 6. Similarly, 9 is the only solution of the equation x = 9. Therefore x− 3 = 6 and x = 9 have the same solution sets and are equivalent. Answer: No. ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Are the equations x2 = 1 and x = 1 equivalent? Are the equations x = 1 and x2 = x equivalent? Solution. By inspection, the equation x2 = 1 has two solutions, −1 and 1. (−1)2 = 1 and (1)2 = 1 On the other hand, the equation x = 1 has a single solution, namely 1. Hence, the equations x2 = 1 and x = 1 do not have the same solution sets and are not equivalent. Answer: No. ! As we shall soon see, equivalent equations play an important role in finding the solution of an equation.
