Multiple Steps Sometimes you need to perform a sequence of steps to arrive at the solution. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Solve for x: 2x + 5 > −7. Sketch the solution on the real Use interval notation to describe the solution of: 3x− 2 ≤ 4 line, then use set-builder and interval notation to describe your solution. Solution: To “undo” adding 5, subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality. 2x+ 5 > −7 Original inequality. 2x+ 5− 5 > −7− 5 Subtract 5 from both sides. 2x > −12 Simplify both sides. To “undo” multiplying by 2, divide both sides by 2. Because we are dividing both sides by a positive number, we do not reverse the inequality sign. 2x 2 > −12 2 Divide both sides by 2. x > −6 Simplify both sides. Shade the real numbers greater than −6. −6 Using set-builder notation, the solution is {x : x > −6}. Using interval nota- tion, the solution is (−6,∞). Answer: (−∞, 2] ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Solve for x: 3 − 5x ≤ 2x + 17. Sketch the solution on the Use interval notation to describe the solution of: 4− x > 2x+ 1 real line, then use set-builder and interval notation to describe your solution. Solution: We need to isolate terms containing x on one side of the inequality. Start by subtracting 2x from both sides of the inequality. 3− 5x ≤ 2x+ 17 Original inequality. 3− 5x− 2x ≤ 2x+ 17− 2x Subtract 2x from both sides. 3− 7x ≤ 17 Simplify both sides. We continue to isolate terms containing x on one side of the inequality. Subtract 3 from both sides. 3− 7x− 3 ≤ 17− 3 Subtract 3 from both sides. −7x ≤ 14 Simplify both sides. 144 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES To “undo” multiplying by −7, divide both sides by −7. Because we are dividing both sides by a negative number, we reverse the inequality sign. −7x −7 ≥ 14 −7 Divide both sides by −7. x ≥ −2 Simplify both sides. Shade the real numbers greater than or equal to −2. −2 Using set-builder notation, the solution is {x : x ≥ −2}. Using interval nota- tion, the solution is [−2,∞).Answer: (−∞, 1) ! We clear fractions from an inequality in the usual manner, by multiplying both sides by the least common denominator. You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Solve for x: 3 4 − x 12 > 1 3 .Use interval notation to describe the solution of: 2x 3 − 3 4 ≥ −3 2 Solution: First, clear the fractions from the inequality by multiplying both sides by the least common denominator, which in this case is 12. 3 4 − x 12 > 1 3 Original inequality. 12 [ 3 4 − x 12 ] > [ 1 3 ] 12 Multiply both sides by 12. 12 [ 3 4 ] − 12 [ x 12 ] > [ 1 3 ] 12 Distribute the 12. 9− x > 4 Cancel and multiply. To “undo” adding 9, subtract 9 from both sides. 9− x− 9 > 4− 9 Subtract 9 from both sides. −x > −5 Simplify both sides. We could divide both sides by −1, but multiplying both sides by −1 will also do the job. Because we are multiplying both sides by a negative number, we reverse the inequality sign. (−1)(−x) < (−5)(−1) Multiply both sides by −1. Reverse the inequality sign. x < 5 Simplify both sides. 2.6.

We clear decimals from an inequality in the usual manner, by multiplying both sides by the appropriate power of ten. You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Solve for x: 3.25− 1.2x > 4.6. Use interval notation to describe the solution of: 2.3x− 5.62 ≥ −1.4 Solution: First, clear the decimals from the inequality by multiplying both sides by 100, which moves each decimal point two places to the right. 3.25− 1.2x > 4.6 Original inequality. 325− 120x > 460 Multiply both sides by 100. 325− 120x− 325 > 460− 325 Subtract 325 from both sides. −120x > 135 Simplify both sides. −120x −120 < 135 −120 Divide both sides by −120.
