The FOIL Method Consider the product of two binomials (x + 3)(x + 6). We already know how to find the product of these two binomials; we multiply x times both terms of x+ 6, then we multiply 3 times both terms of x+ 6. (x+ 3)(x+ 6) = x2 + 6x+ 3x+ 18 Normally we combine like terms, but we halt the process at this point so as to introduce the pattern called the FOIL method. The letters in the word FOIL stand for “First,” “Outer,” “Inner,” and “Last.” Let’s see how we can connect these terms to the product (x+3)(x+6). • The arrows indicate the terms in the “First” positions in each binomial. If you multiply the terms in the “First” position, you get x2. (x+ 3)(x+ 6) F • The arrows indicate the terms in the “Outer” positions in each binomial. If you multiply the terms in the “Outer” positions, you get 6x. (x+ 3)(x+ 6) O • The arrows indicate the terms in the “Inner” positions in each binomial. If you multiply the terms in the “Inner” positions, you get 3x. (x+ 3)(x+ 6) I • The arrows indicate the terms in the “Last” positions in each binomial. If you multiply the terms in the “Last” positions, you get 18. (x+ 3)(x+ 6) L 5.7. SPECIAL PRODUCTS 371 The following diagram shows the connection between “First,” “Outer,” “In- ner,” “Last,” and the answer. F O I L (x+ 3)(x+ 6) = x2 + 6x + 3x + 18 You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Use the FOIL method to simplify: (x+ 5)(x+ 7) Simplify: (x+ 2)(x+ 11) Solution: Multiply the “First” positions: x2. Multiply the “Outer” positions: 7x. Multiply the “Inner” positions: 5x. Multiply the “Last” positions: 35. F O I L (x+ 5)(x+ 7) = x2 + 7x + 5x + 35 Combining like terms, (x+ 5)(x+ 7) = x2 + 12x+ 35. Answer: x2 + 13x+ 22 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Use the FOIL method to simplify: (2x− 7)(x− 4) Simplify: (x− 1)(4x+ 5) Solution: Multiply the “First” positions: 2x2. Multiply the “Outer” posi- tions: −8x. Multiply the “Inner” positions: −7x. Multiply the “Last” posi- tions: 28. F O I L (2x− 7)(x− 4) = 2x2 − 8x − 7x + 28 Combining like terms, (2x− 7)(x− 4) = 2x2 − 15x+ 28. Answer: 4x2 + x− 5 ! At first glance, the FOIL method doesn’t look like much of a shortcut. After all, if we simply use the distributive property on the product of Example 2, we get the same quick result. (2x− 7)(x− 4) = 2x(x− 4)− 7(x− 4) = 2x2 − 8x− 7x+ 28 = 2x2 − 15x+ 28 The FOIL method becomes a true shortcut when we add the “Outer” and “Inner” results in our head. 372 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS FOIL Shortcut. To multiply two binomials, follow these steps: 1. Multiply the terms in the “First” positions. 2. Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and combine the results mentally (if they are like terms). 3. Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Use the FOIL shortcut to simplify: (3x+ 8)(2x− 1)Simplify: (2z − 3)(5z − 1) Solution: Each of the following steps is performed mentally. 1. Multiply the terms in the “First” positions: 6x2 2. Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and add the results mentally: −3x+ 16x = 13x 3. Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions: −8 Write the answer with no intermediate steps: (3x+8)(2x− 1) = 6x2 +13x− 8. Answer: 10z2 − 17z + 3 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Use the FOIL shortcut to simplify: (4y − 3)(5y + 2)Simplify: (7x+ 2)(2x− 3) Solution: Each of the following steps is performed mentally. 1. Multiply the terms in the “First” positions: 20y2 2. Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and add the results mentally: 8y − 15y = −7y 3. Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions: −6 Write the answer with no intermediate steps: (4y− 3)(5y+2) = 20y2− 7y− 6. Answer: 14x2 − 17x− 6 ! 5.7.
