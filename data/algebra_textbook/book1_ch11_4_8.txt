Addition And Parallel Or Coincident Lines When the lines of a system are parallel or coincident, the method of elimination produces results identical to that of the method of elimination by substitution. Addition and Parallel Lines If computations eliminate all variables and produce a contradiction, the two lines of the system are parallel and the system is called inconsistent. Addition and Coincident Lines If computations eliminate all variables and produce an identity, the two lines of the system are coincident and the system is called dependent.
