 || Rational Expressions In arithmetic it is noted that a fraction is a quotient of two whole numbers. The expression , where a and b are any two whole numbers and b ≠ 0, is called a fraction. The top number, a , is called the numerator, and the bottom number, b , is called the denominator. Simple Algebraic Fraction We define a simple algebraic fraction in a similar manner. Rather than restrict­ing ourselves only to numbers, we use polynomials for the numerator and denomi­nator. Another term for a simple algebraic fraction is a rational expression. A rational expression is an expression of the form , where P and Q are both polyno­mials and Q never represents the zero polynomial. Rational Expression A rational expression is an algebraic expression that can be written as the quotient of two polynomials. Examples 1–4 are rational expressions: Example 8.1.  is a rational expression: P is x + 9 and Q is x – 7. Example 8.2.  is a rational expression: P is x 3 + 5x 2 – 12x + 1 and Q is x 4 – 10. Example 8.3.  is a rational expression: P is 3 and Q is 8. Example 8.4.  4x – 5 is a rational expression since 4x – 5 can be written as : P is 4x – 5 and Q is 1. Example 8.5.  is not a rational expression since is not a polynomial. In the rational expression , P is called the numerator and Q is called the denominator. Domain of a Rational Expression Since division by zero is not defined, we must be careful to note the values for which the rational expression is valid. The collection of values for which the rational expression is defined is called the domain of the rational expression. (Recall our study of the domain of an equation in Section Section 4.8.) Finding the Domain of a Rational Expression To find the domain of a rational expression we must ask, "What values, if any, of the variable will make the denominator zero?" To find these values, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve. If any zero-producing values are obtained, they are not included in the domain. All other real numbers are included in the domain (unless some have been excluded for particular situational reasons).  || Zero-Factor Property Sometimes to find the domain of a rational expression, it is necessary to factor the denominator and use the zero-factor property of real numbers. Zero-factor Property If two real numbers a and b are multiplied together and the resulting product is 0, then at least one of the factors must be zero, that is, either a = 0, b = 0, or both a = 0 and b = 0. The following examples illustrate the use of the zero-factor property. Example 8.6.  What value will produce zero in the expression 4x ? By the zero-factor property, if 4x = 0, then x = 0. Example 8.7.  What value will produce zero in the expression 8(x – 6)? By the zero-factor property, if 8(x – 6) = 0, then Thus, 8(x – 6) = 0 when x = 6. Example 8.8.  What value(s) will produce zero in the expression (x – 3)(x + 5)? By the zero-factor property, if (x – 3)(x + 5) = 0, then Thus, (x – 3)(x + 5) = 0 when x = 3 or x = – 5. Example 8.9.  What value(s) will produce zero in the expression x 2 + 6x + 8? We must factor x 2 + 6x + 8 to put it into the zero-factor property form. x 2 + 6x + 8 = (x + 2)(x + 4) Now, (x + 2)(x + 4) = 0 when Thus, x 2 + 6x + 8 = 0 when x = – 2 or x = – 4. Example 8.10.  What value(s) will produce zero in the expression 6x 2 – 19x – 7? We must factor 6x 2 – 19x – 7 to put it into the zero-factor property form. 6x 2 – 19x – 7 = (3x + 1)(2x – 7) Now, (3x + 1)(2x – 7) = 0 when Thus, 6x 2 – 19x – 7 = 0 when or .  || The Equality Property of Fractions From our experience with arithmetic we may recall the equality property of fractions. Let a , b , c , d be real numbers such that b ≠ 0 and d ≠ 0. Equality Property of Fractions If , then a d = b c . If a d = b c , then . Two fractions are equal when their cross-products are equal. We see this property in the following examples: Example 8.19.  , since 2 · 12 = 3 · 8. Example 8.20.  , since 5y · 6y = 2 · 15y 2 and 30y 2 = 30y 2 . Example 8.21.  Since 9a · 4 = 18a · 2, .  || The Negative Property of Fractions A useful property of fractions is the negative property of fractions. Negative Property of Fractions The negative sign of a fraction may be placed in front of the fraction, , in the numerator of the fraction, , in the denominator of the fraction, . All three fractions will have the same value, that is, The negative property of fractions is illustrated by the fractions To see this, consider . Is this correct?By the equality property of fractions, – (3 · 4) = – 12 and – 3 · 4 = – 12. Thus, . Convince yourself that the other two fractions are equal as well. This same property holds for rational expressions and negative signs. This property is often quite helpful in simplifying a rational expression (as we shall need to do in subsequent sections). If either the numerator or denominator of a fraction or a fraction itself is immediately preceded by a negative sign, it is usually most convenient to place the negative sign in the numerator for later operations.  ||
