The General Form of a Line We have seen that the general form of a linear equation in two variables is a x + b y = c (Section Section 7.4). When this equation is solved for y , the resulting form is called the slope-intercept form. Let's generate this new form. This equation is of the form y = m x + b if we replace with m and constant with b . (Note: The fact that we let is unfortunate and occurs beacuse of the letters we have chosen to use in the general form. The letter b occurs on both sides of the equal sign and may not represent the same value at all. This problem is one of the historical convention and, fortunately, does not occur very often.) The following examples illustrate this procedure. Example 7.15.  Solve 3x + 2y = 6 for y . This equation is of the form y = m x + b . In this case, and b = 3 . Example 7.16.  Solve – 15x + 5y = 20 for y . This equation is of the form y = m x + b . In this case, m = 3 and b = 4 . Example 7.17.  Solve 4x – y = 0 for y . This equation is of the form y = m x + b . In this case, m = 4 and b = 0 . Notice that we can write y = 4x as y = 4x + 0 .
