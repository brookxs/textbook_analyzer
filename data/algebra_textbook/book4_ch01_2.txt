 || Numbers and Numerals We begin our study of introductory mathematics by examining its most basic building block, the number. Number A number is a concept. It exists only in the mind. The earliest concept of a number was a thought that allowed people to mentally picture the size of some collection of objects. To write down the number being conceptualized, a numeral is used. Numeral A numeral is a symbol that represents a number. In common usage today we do not distinguish between a number and a numeral. In our study of introductory mathematics, we will follow this common usage. Sample Set A The following are numerals. In each case, the first represents the number four, the second repre­sents the number one hundred twenty-three, and the third, the number one thousand five. These numbers are represented in different ways. Hindu-Arabic numerals 4, 123, 1005 Roman numerals IV, CXXIII, MV Egyptian numerals Practice Set A Exercise 1.2.1. (Go to Solution) Do the phrases "four," "one hundred twenty-three," and "one thousand five" qualify as numerals? Yes or no?  || The Hindu-Arabic Numeration System Hindu-Arabic Numeration System Our society uses the Hindu-Arabic numeration system. This system of numer­ation began shortly before the third century when the Hindus invented the nu­merals 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Leonardo Fibonacci About a thousand years later, in the thirteenth century, a mathematician named Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa introduced the system into Europe. It was then popu­larized by the Arabs. Thus, the name, Hindu-Arabic numeration system.  || The Base Ten Positional Number System Digits The Hindu-Arabic numerals 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 are called digits. We can form any number in the number system by selecting one or more digits and placing them in certain positions. Each position has a particular value. The Hindu mathematician who devised the system about A.D. 500 stated that "from place to place each is ten times the preceding." Base Ten Positional Systems It is for this reason that our number system is called a positional number system with base ten. Commas When numbers are composed of more than three digits, commas are sometimes used to separate the digits into groups of three. Periods These groups of three are called periods and they greatly simplify reading numbers. In the Hindu-Arabic numeration system, a period has a value assigned to each or its three positions, and the values are the same for each period. The position values are Thus, each period contains a position for the values of one, ten, and hundred. Notice that, in looking from right to left, the value of each position is ten times the preceding. Each period has a particular name. As we continue from right to left, there are more periods. The five periods listed above are the most common, and in our study of introductory mathematics, they are sufficient. The following diagram illustrates our positional number system to trillions. (There are, to be sure, other periods.) In our positional number system, the value of a digit is determined by its position in the number. Sample Set B Example 1.1.  Find the value of 6 in the number 7,261. Since 6 is in the tens position of the units period, its value is 6 tens. 6 tens = 60 Example 1.2.  Find the value of 9 in the number 86,932,106,005. Since 9 is in the hundreds position of the millions period, its value is 9 hundred millions. 9 hundred millions = 9 hundred million Example 1.3.  Find the value of 2 in the number 102,001. Since 2 is in the ones position of the thousands period, its value is 2 one thousands. 2 one thousands = 2 thousand Practice Set B Exercise 1.2.2. (Go to Solution) Find the value of 5 in the number 65,000. Exercise 1.2.3. (Go to Solution) Find the value of 4 in the number 439,997,007,010. Exercise 1.2.4. (Go to Solution) Find the value of 0 in the number 108.  || Whole Numbers Whole Numbers Numbers that are formed using only the digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 are called whole numbers. They are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, … The three dots at the end mean "and so on in this same pattern."  || Graphing Whole Numbers Number Line Whole numbers may be visualized by constructing a number line. To construct a number line, we simply draw a straight line and choose any point on the line and label it 0. Origin This point is called the origin. We then choose some convenient length, and moving to the right, mark off consecutive intervals (parts) along the line starting at 0. We label each new interval endpoint with the next whole number. Graphing We can visually display a whole number by drawing a closed circle at the point labeled with that whole number. Another phrase for visually displaying a whole number is graphing the whole number. The word graph means to "visually display." Sample Set C Example 1.4.  Graph the following whole numbers: 3, 5, 9. Example 1.5.  Specify the whole numbers that are graphed on the following number line. The break in the number line indicates that we are aware of the whole numbers between 0 and 106, and 107 and 872, but we are not listing them due to space limitations. The numbers that have been graphed are 0, 106, 873, 874 Practice Set C Exercise 1.2.5. (Go to Solution) Graph the following whole numbers: 46, 47, 48, 325, 327. Exercise 1.2.6. (Go to Solution) Specify the whole numbers that are graphed on the following number line. A line is composed of an endless number of points. Notice that we have labeled only some of them. As we proceed, we will discover new types of numbers and determine their location on the number line.  ||
