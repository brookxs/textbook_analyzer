Speeding Things Up a Bit Some readers might already be asking “Do I really have to list all of those ordered pairs if I already see the pair I need?” The answer is “No!” If you see the pair you need, use it to break up the middle term of the trinomial as a sum of like terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Factor: 3x2 − 7x− 6.Factor: 2x2 − 9x+ 10 Solution: Compare 3x2−7x−6 with ax2+bx+c and note that a = 3, b = −7, and c = −6. Calculate ac = (3)(−6), so ac = −18. Now can you think of an integer pair whose product is ac = −18 and whose sum is b = −7? For some, the pair just pops into their head: 2 and −9. Break up the middle term into a sum of like terms using the pair 2 and −9. 3x2−7x− 6 = 3x2+2x− 9x− 6 −7x = 2x− 9x. = x (3x+ 2)− 3 (3x+ 2) Factor by grouping. = (x − 3)(3x+ 2) Factor out (3x+ 2). Use the FOIL shortcut to check your answer. F O I L (x− 3)(3x+ 2) = 3x2 + 2x − 9x − 6 6.4. FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A != 1 429 Combining like terms, (x−3)(3x+2) = 3x2−7x−6, the original trinomial. Our solution checks. Note that if you combine the “Outer” and “Inner” products mentally, the check goes even faster. Answer: (x − 2)(2x− 5) ! On the other hand, some readers might be saying “Well, the needed ordered pair is not popping into my head. Do I have a way of cutting down the work?” The answer is “Yes!” As you are listing the ordered pairs whose product equals ac, be mindful that you need the ordered pair whose sum is b. If you stumble across the needed pair, stop the listing process and “drop” your ordered pair in place. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Factor: 3x2 − 33x+ 54. Factor: 5x2 − 35x− 40 Solution: Compare 3x2 − 33x + 54 with ax2 + bx + c and note that a = 3, b = −33, and c = 54. Calculate ac = (3)(54), so ac = 162. Ouch! That’s a big number! However, start listing the integer pairs whose product is ac = 162, but be mindful that you need an integer pair whose sum is b = −33. 1, 162 2, 81 3, 54 6, 27 −6,−27 As soon as we wrote down the pair 6 and 27, our mind said “the sum of 6 and 7 is 33.” However, we need the sum to equal b = −33, so we boxed −6 and −27 instead. Next, we break up the middle term into a sum of like terms using our circled pair. 3x2−33x− 54 = 3x2−6x− 27x− 54 −33x = −6x− 27x. = 3x (x− 2)− 27(x− 2) Factor by grouping. = (3x− 27)(x− 2) Factor out (x− 2). Oh-oh! Now we realize we can factor 3 out of each term in the first factor! = 3(x− 9)(x− 2) We missed taking out the GCF! Let’s try again, only this time let’s do what we are always supposed to do in the first step: Factor out the GCF. 3x2 − 33x+ 54 = 3(x2 − 11x+ 18) 430 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING Comparing x2 − 11x + 18 with ax2 + bx + c, we see that a = 1, b = −11, and c = 18. We need an integer pair whose product is ac = 18 and whose sum is b = −11. Note that these numbers are considerably smaller than the numbers we had to deal with when we forgot to first factor out the GCF. Because the numbers are smaller, the integer pair −9 and −2 easily comes to mind. Furthermore, because a = 1, we can factor x2 − 11x + 18 by simply dropping the integer pair −9 and −2 in place. 3(x2 − 11x+ 18) = 3(x− 9)(x− 2) A far simpler solution!Answer: 5(x− 8)(x+ 1) ! In Example 3, we saw how much more difficult we made the problem by forgetting to first factor out the greatest common factor (GCF). Let’s try not to make that mistake again. First rule of factoring. The first step in factoring any polynomial is to factor out the greatest common factor. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Factor: 30x3 − 21x2 − 18x.Factor: 12x4 + 2x3 − 30x2 Solution: Note that the GCF of 30x3, 21x2, and 18x is 3x. Factor out this GCF. 30x3 − 21x2 − 18x = 3x · 10x2 − 3x · 7x− 3x · 6 = 3x(10x2 − 7x− 6) Next, compare 10x2 − 7x− 6 with ax2 + bx+ c and note that a = 10, b = −7, and c = −6. Start listing the integer pairs whose product is ac = −60, but be mindful that you need an integer pair whose sum is b = −7. 1,−60 2,−30 3,−20 4,−15 5,−12 Break up the middle term into a sum of like terms using our circled pair. 3x(10x2 − 7x− 6) = 3x(10x2 + 5x− 12x− 18) −7x = 5x− 12x. = 3x [ 5x(2x+ 1)− 6(2x+ 1)] Factor by grouping. = 3x(5x− 6)(2x+ 1) Factor out a 2x+ 1. Hence, 30x3 − 21x2 − 18x = 3x(5x− 6)(2x+ 1). 6.4. FACTORING AX2 +BX + C WHEN A != 1 431 Check: First, use the FOIL shortcut to multiply the two binomial factors, then distribute the monomial factor. 3x(5x− 6)(2x+ 1) = 3x(10x2 − 7x− 6) Apply the FOIL shortcut. = 30x3 − 21x2 − 18x Distribute the 3x. Because this is the original polynomial, the solution checks. Answer: 2x2(3x+5)(2x− 3) !
