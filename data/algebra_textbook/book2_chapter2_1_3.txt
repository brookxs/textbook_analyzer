Using Formulas The main difference between algebra and arithmetic is the organized use of variables. This idea leads to reusable formulas A reusable mathematical model using algebraic expressions to describe a common application. , which are mathematical models using algebraic expressions to describe common applications. For example, the area of a rectangle is modeled by the formula: In this equation, variables are used to describe the relationship between the area of a rectangle and the length of its sides. The area is the product of the length and width of the rectangle. If the length of a rectangle measures 3 meters and the width measures 2 meters, then the area can be calculated using the formula as follows:   Example 9: The cost of a daily truck rental is $48.00 plus an additional $0.45 for every mile driven. This cost in dollars can be modeled by the formula c o s t = 0.45 x + 48 , where x represents the number of miles driven in one day. Use this formula to calculate the cost to rent the truck for a day and drive it 120 miles. Solution: Use the formula to find the cost when the number of miles x = 120 . Substitute 120 into the given formula for x and then simplify. Answer: The rental costs $102.   Uniform motion Described by the formula D = r t , where the distance D is given as the product of the average rate r and the time t traveled at that rate. is modeled by the formula D = r t , which expresses distance D in terms of the average rate r, or speed, and the time t traveled at that rate. This formula, D = r t , is used often and is read “distance equals rate times time.”   Example 10: Jim’s road trip takes 2 1 2 hours at an average speed of 66 miles per hour. How far does he travel? Solution: Substitute the appropriate values into the formula and then simplify. Answer: Jim travels 165 miles.   The volume in cubic units of a rectangular box is given by the formula V = l w h , where l represents the length, w represents the width, and h represents the height.   Example 11: A wooden box is 1 foot in length, 5 inches wide, and 6 inches high. Find the volume of the box in cubic inches. Solution: Take care to ensure that all the units are consistent and use 12 inches for the length instead of 1 foot. Answer: The volume of the box is 360 cubic inches.   Simple interest Modeled by the formula I = p r t , where p represents the principal amount invested at an annual interest rate r for t years. I is given by the formula I = p r t , where p represents the principal amount invested at an annual interest rate r for t years.   Example 12: Calculate the simple interest earned on a 2-year investment of $1,250 at an annual interest rate of 3 3 4 % . Solution: Convert 3 3 4 % to a decimal number before using it in the formula. Use this value for r and the fact that p = $1,250 and t = 2 years to calculate the simple interest. Answer: The simple interest earned is $93.75.   Try this! The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2 l + 2 w , where l represents the length and w represents the width. Use the formula to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 5 feet and a width of 2 1 2 feet. Answer: 15 feet Video Solution Using Formulas The main difference between algebra and arithmetic is the organized use of variables.
