 || Fractions of Fractions We know that a fraction represents a part of a whole quantity. For example, two fifths of one unit can be represented by of the whole is shaded. A natural question is, what is a fractional part of a fractional quantity, or, what is a fraction of a fraction? For example, what of ? We can suggest an answer to this question by using a picture to examine of . First, let’s represent . of the whole is shaded. Then divide each of the parts into 3 equal parts. Each part is of the whole. Now we’ll take of the unit. of is , which reduces to .  || Multiplication of Fractions Now we ask, what arithmetic operation (+, –, ×, ÷) will produce from of ? Notice that, if in the fractions and , we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together, we get precisely . This reduces to as before. Using this observation, we can suggest the following: The Word "OF" Indicates Multiplication: The word "of" translates to the arithmetic operation "times." The Method of Multiplying Fractions: To multiply two or more fractions, multiply the numerators together and then multiply the denominators together. Reduce if necessary. Sample Set A Perform the following multiplications. Example 4.31.  Thus This means that of is , that is, of of a unit is of the original unit. Example 4.32.  . Write 4 as a fraction by writing This means that of 4 whole units is of one whole unit. Example 4.33.  This means that of of of a whole unit is of the original unit.

The reduction can be tedious if the numbers in the fractions are large. For example, We avoid the process of reducing if we divide out common factors before we multi­ply. Divide 3 into 9 and 21, and divide 2 into 10 and 16. The product is a fraction that is reduced to lowest terms. The Process of Multiplication by Dividing Out Common Factors To multiply fractions by dividing out common factors, divide out factors that are common to both a numerator and a denominator. The factor being divided out can appear in any numerator and any denominator. Sample Set B Perform the following multiplications. Example 4.34.  Divide 4 and 6 by 2 Divide 5 and 5 by 5 Example 4.35.  Divide 8 and 10 by 2. Divide 8 and 12 by 4. Example 4.36.  Example 4.37.  Example 4.38.  Practice Set B Perform the following multiplications. Exercise 4.5.10. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.5.11. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.5.12.

Sample Set C Perform the following multiplications. Convert improper fractions to mixed numbers. Example 4.39.  Convert each mixed number to an improper fraction. Example 4.40.  Convert to an improper fraction. . There are no common factors to divide out. Example 4.41.  Convert to improper fractions. Example 4.42.  Practice Set C Perform the following multiplications. Convert improper fractions to mixed numbers. Exercise 4.5.17. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.5.18. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.5.19.
