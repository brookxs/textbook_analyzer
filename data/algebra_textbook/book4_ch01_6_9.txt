Subtraction Involving Borrowing Minuend and Subtrahend It often happens in the subtraction of two whole numbers that a digit in the minuend (top number) will be less than the digit in the same position in the subtrahend (bottom number). This happens when we subtract 27 from 84. We do not have a name for 4 − 7. We need to rename 84 in order to continue. We'll do so as follows: Our new name for 84 is 7 tens + 14 ones. Notice that we converted 8 tens to 7 tens + 1 ten, and then we converted the 1 ten to 10 ones. We then had 14 ones and were able to perform the subtraction. Borrowing The process of borrowing (converting) is illustrated in the problems of Sample Set C. Sample Set C Example 1.38.  Borrow 1 ten from the 8 tens. This leaves 7 tens. Convert the 1 ten to 10 ones. Add 10 ones to 4 ones to get 14 ones. Example 1.39.  Borrow 1 hundred from the 6 hundreds. This leaves 5 hundreds. Convert the 1 hundred to 10 tens. Add 10 tens to 7 tens to get 17 tens. Practice Set C Perform the following subtractions. Show the expanded form for the first three problems. Exercise 1.6.9. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.10.

(Go to Solution) Borrowing More Than Once Sometimes it is necessary to borrow more than once. This is shown in the problems in the section called “Sample Set D”. Sample Set D Perform the Subtractions. Borrowing more than once if necessary Example 1.40.  Borrow 1 ten from the 4 tens. This leaves 3 tens. Convert the 1 ten to 10 ones. Add 10 ones to 1 one to get 11 ones. We can now perform 11 − 8. Borrow 1 hundred from the 6 hundreds. This leaves 5 hundreds. Convert the 1 hundred to 10 tens. Add 10 tens to 3 tens to get 13 tens. Now 13 − 5 = 8. 5 − 3 = 2. Example 1.41.  Borrow 1 ten from the 3 tens. This leaves 2 tens. Convert the 1 ten to 10 ones. Add 10 ones to 4 ones to get 14 ones. We can now perform 14 − 5. Borrow 1 hundred from the 5 hundreds. This leaves 4 hundreds. Convert the 1 hundred to 10 tens. Add 10 tens to 2 tens to get 12 tens. We can now perform 12 − 8 = 4. Finally, 4 − 0 = 4. Example 1.42.  After borrowing, we have Practice Set D Perform the following subtractions. Exercise 1.6.15. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.16. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.6.17.
