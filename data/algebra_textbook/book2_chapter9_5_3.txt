Finding the Vertex by Completing the Square In this section, we demonstrate an alternate approach for finding the vertex. Any quadratic equation y = a x 2 + b x + c can be rewritten in the form In this form, the vertex is (h, k).   Example 10: Determine the vertex: y = − 4 ( x − 3 ) 2 + 1 . Solution: When the equation is in this form, we can read the vertex directly from the equation. Here h = 3 and k = 1. Answer: The vertex is (3, 1).   Example 11: Determine the vertex: y = 2 ( x + 3 ) 2 − 2 . Solution: Rewrite the equation as follows before determining h and k. Here h = −3 and k = −2. Answer: The vertex is (−3, −2).   Often the equation is not given in this form. To obtain this form, complete the square.   Example 12: Rewrite in y = a ( x − h ) 2 + k form and determine the vertex: y = x 2 + 4 x + 9 . Solution: Begin by making room for the constant term that completes the square. The idea is to add and subtract the value that completes the square, ( b 2 ) 2 , and then factor. In this case, add and subtract ( 4 2 ) 2 = ( 2 ) 2 = 4 . Adding and subtracting the same value within an expression does not change it. Doing so is equivalent to adding 0. Once the equation is in this form, we can easily determine the vertex. Here h = −2 and k = 5. Answer: The vertex is (−2, 5).   If there is a leading coefficient other than 1, then we must first factor out the leading coefficient from the first two terms of the trinomial.   Example 13: Rewrite in y = a ( x − h ) 2 + k form and determine the vertex: y = 2 x 2 − 4 x + 8 . Solution: Since a = 2, factor this out of the first two terms in order to complete the square. Leave room inside the parentheses to add a constant term. Now use −2 to determine the value that completes the square. In this case, ( − 2 2 ) 2 = ( − 1 ) 2 = 1 . Add and subtract 1 and factor as follows: In this form, we can easily determine the vertex. Here h = 1 and k = 6. Answer: The vertex is (1, 6).   Try this! Rewrite in y = a ( x − h ) 2 + k form and determine the vertex: y = − 2 x 2 − 12 x + 3 . Answer: y = − 2 ( x + 3 ) 2 + 21 ; vertex: (−3, 21) Video Solution Finding the Vertex by Completing the Square In this section, we demonstrate an alternate approach for finding the vertex.
