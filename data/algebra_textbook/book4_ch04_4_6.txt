Methods of Reducing Fractions to Lowest Terms Method 1: Dividing Out Common Primes Write the numerator and denominator as a product of primes. Divide the numerator and denominator by each of the common prime factors. We often indicate this division by drawing a slanted line through each divided out factor. This process is also called cancelling common factors. The product of the remaining factors in the numerator and the product of remaining factors of the denominator are relatively prime, and this fraction is reduced to lowest terms. Sample Set B Reduce each fraction to lowest terms. Example 4.20.  1 and 3 are relatively prime. Example 4.21.  4 and 5 are relatively prime. Example 4.22.  7 and 13 are relatively prime (and also truly prime) Example 4.23.  15 and 16 are relatively prime. Example 4.24.  No common prime factors, so 8 and 15 are relatively prime. The fraction is reduced to lowest terms. Practice Set B Reduce each fraction to lowest terms. Exercise 4.4.6. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.4.7. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.4.8.

(Go to Solution) Method 2: Dividing Out Common Factors Mentally divide the numerator and the denominator by a factor that is com­mon to each. Write the quotient above the original number. Continue this process until the numerator and denominator are relatively prime. Sample Set C Reduce each fraction to lowest terms. Example 4.25.  . 5 divides into both 25 and 30. 5 and 6 are relatively prime. Example 4.26.  . Both numbers are even so we can divide by 2. Now, both 9 and 12 are divisible by 3. 3 and 4 are relatively prime. Example 4.27.  . 7 and 5 are relatively prime. Example 4.28.  . 3 and 8 are relatively prime. Practice Set C Reduce each fraction to lowest terms. Exercise 4.4.12. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.4.13. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.4.14. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.4.15.
