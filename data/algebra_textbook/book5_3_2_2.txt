Adjusting the Viewing Window Note that Figure 3.31 gives us some sense of the meaning of the “standard viewing window” produced by selecting 6:ZStandard from the ZOOM menu. Each time you select 6:ZStandard from the ZOOMmenu, Xmin is set to −10, Xmax to 10, and Xscl to 1 (distance between the tick marks on the x-axis). Similarly, Ymin is set to −10, Ymax to 10, and Yscl to 1 (distance between the tick marks on the y-axis). You can, however, override these settings as we shall see in the next example. You Try It!

Solution: We must first decide on the proper syntax to use when entering the equations. In the case of the first equation, note that y = 5 4 x− 3 is pronounced “y equals five-fourths x minus three,” and means “y equals five- fourths times x minus three.” Enter this equation into Y1 in the Y= menu as 5/4*X−3 (see Figure 3.33), using the button keystrokes: 5 ÷ 4 × X,T, θ, n − 3 The division and times buttons are located in the rightmost column of the calculuator. Similarly, enter the second equation into Y2 as 2/3*X+4 using the button keystrokes: 2 ÷ 3 × X,T, θ, n + 4 Select 6:ZStandard in the ZOOM menu to produce the lines in Figure 3.34. When we examine the resulting graphs in Figure 3.34, it appears that their point of intersection will occur off the screen above and to the right of the upper right-corner of the current viewing window. With this thought in mind, let’s extend the x-axis to the right by increasing the value of Xmax to 20. Further, let’s extend the y-axis upward by increasing the value of Ymin to 20. Press the WINDOW button on the top row of the calculator, then make the adjustments shown in Figure 3.35. 3.2. THE GRAPHING CALCULATOR 177 Figure 3.33: Enter equations. Figure 3.34: The graphs. Figure 3.35: Adjusting the viewing window. Figure 3.36: The point of intersec- tion is visible in the new viewing window. If we select 6:ZStandard from the ZOOM menu, our changes to the WIN- DOW parameters will be discarded and the viewing window will be returned to the “standard viewing window.” If we want to keep our changes to the WIN- DOW parameters, the correct approach at this point is to push the GRAPH button on the top row of the calculator. The resulting graph is shown in Figure 3.36. Note that the point of intersection of the two lines is now visible in the viewing window. The image in Figure 3.36 is ready for recording onto your homework. How- ever, we think we would have a better picture if we made a couple more changes: 1. It would be nicer if the point of intersection were more centered in the viewing window. 2. There are far too many tick marks. With these thoughts in mind, make the changes to the WINDOW parame- ters shown in Figure 3.37, then push the GRAPH button to produce the image in Figure 3.38. 178 CHAPTER 3.
