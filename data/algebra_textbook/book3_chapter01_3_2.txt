The formal development of the real number system starts with the field axioms. The field axioms are postulated, and then all the other properties follow from them. The field axioms are The associative and commutative laws for addition and multiplication The existence of the additive and multiplicative identities (0 and 1) The existence of the additive inverse (opposites, or negatives) and the multiplicative inverse (the reciprocal) The distributive law All of these are essential, but the distributive law is particularly important because it is what distinguishes the behavior of multiplication from addition. Namely, multiplication distributes over addition but not vice-versa. The rules of arithmetic like “a negative times a negative gives a positive” are what they are because that is the only way the field axioms would still hold. For example, the distributive law requires that –2(3 – 2) = (–2)(3) + (–2)(–2) We can evaluate the left side of this equation by following the order of operations, which says to do what is in parentheses first, so –2(3 – 2) = –2(1) = –2. Now for the distributive law to be true, the right side must also be equal to -2, so (–2)(3) + (–2)(–2) = –2 If we use our sign rules for multiplication then it works out the way it should: (–2)(3) + (–2)(–2) = –6 + 4 = –2   Sign Rules for Multiplication (+)(+) = (+) (–)(–) = (+) (–)(+) = (–) (+)(–) = (–) Multiplication Table Notice how the step size in each row or column remains consistent, regardless of whether we are multiplying positive or negative numbers.   -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 -5 25 20 15 10 5 0 -5 -10 -15 -20 -25 -4 20 16 12 8 4 0 -4 -8 -12 -16 -20 -3 15 12 9 6 3 0 -3 -6 -9 -12 -15 -2 10 8 6 4 2 0 -2 -4 -6 -8 -10 -1 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 2 -10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 3 -15 -12 -9 -6 -3 0 3 6 9 12 15 4 -20 -16 -12 -8 -4 0 4 8 12 16 20 5 -25 -20 -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 25   For math purists, here’s the real reason: The Real Reason It should be obvious that the presentation of the rules of arithmetic given here is just a collection of motivational arguments, not a formal development.
