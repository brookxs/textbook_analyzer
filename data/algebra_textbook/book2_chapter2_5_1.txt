Key Words, Translation, and Strategy Algebra simplifies the process of solving real-world problems. This is done by using letters to represent unknowns, restating problems in the form of equations, and offering systematic techniques for solving those equations. To solve problems using algebra, first translate the wording of the problem into mathematical statements that describe the relationships between the given information and the unknowns. Usually, this translation to mathematical statements is the difficult step in the process. The key to the translation is to carefully read the problem and identify certain key words and phrases. Key Words Translation Sum, increased by, more than, plus, added to, total + Difference, decreased by, subtracted from, less, minus − Product, multiplied by, of, times, twice * Quotient, divided by, ratio, per / Is, total, result = Here are some examples of translated key phrases. Key Phrases Translation The sum of a number and 7. x + 7 Seven more than a number. The difference of a number and 7. x − 7 Seven less than a number. Seven subtracted from a number. The product of 2 and a number. 2 x Twice a number. One-half of a number. 1 2 x The quotient of a number and 7. x / 7 When translating sentences into mathematical statements, be sure to read the sentence several times and identify the key words and phrases.   Example 1: Translate: Four less than twice some number is 16. Solution: First, choose a variable for the unknown number and identify the key words and phrases. Let x represent the unknown indicated by “some number.” Remember that subtraction is not commutative. For this reason, take care when setting up differences. In this example, 4 − 2 x = 16 is an incorrect translation. Answer: 2 x − 4 = 16   It is important to first identify the variable—let x represent…—and state in words what the unknown quantity is. This step not only makes your work more readable but also forces you to think about what you are looking for. Usually, if you know what you are asked to find, then the task of finding it is achievable.   Example 2: Translate: When 7 is subtracted from 3 times the sum of a number and 12, the result is 20. Solution: Let n represent the unknown number. Answer: 3 ( n + 12 ) − 7 = 20   To understand why parentheses are needed, study the structures of the following two sentences and their translations: “3 times the sum of a number and 12” 3 ( n + 12 ) “the sum of 3 times a number and 12” 3 n + 12 The key is to focus on the phrase “3 times the sum.” This prompts us to group the sum within parentheses and then multiply by 3. Once an application is translated into an algebraic equation, solve it using the techniques you have learned. Guidelines for Setting Up and Solving Word Problems Step 1: Read the problem several times, identify the key words and phrases, and organize the given information. Step 2: Identify the variables by assigning a letter or expression to the unknown quantities. Step 3: Translate and set up an algebraic equation that models the problem. Step 4: Solve the resulting algebraic equation. Step 5: Finally, answer the question in sentence form and make sure it makes sense (check it). For now, set up all of your equations using only one variable. Avoid two variables by looking for a relationship between the unknowns.
