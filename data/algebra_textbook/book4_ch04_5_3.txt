Multiplication of Fractions Now we ask, what arithmetic operation (+, –, ×, ÷) will produce from of ? Notice that, if in the fractions and , we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together, we get precisely . This reduces to as before. Using this observation, we can suggest the following: The Word "OF" Indicates Multiplication: The word "of" translates to the arithmetic operation "times." The Method of Multiplying Fractions: To multiply two or more fractions, multiply the numerators together and then multiply the denominators together. Reduce if necessary. Sample Set A Perform the following multiplications. Example 4.31.  Thus This means that of is , that is, of of a unit is of the original unit. Example 4.32.  . Write 4 as a fraction by writing This means that of 4 whole units is of one whole unit. Example 4.33.  This means that of of of a whole unit is of the original unit. Practice Set A Perform the following multiplications. Exercise 4.5.1. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.5.2. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.5.3. (Go to Solution) Exercise 4.5.4.
