RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS  || 7.1 Negative Exponents We begin with a seemingly silly but powerful definition on what it means to raise a number to a power of −1. Raising to a Power of −1. To raise an object to a power of −1, simply invert the object (turn it upside down). −1 = More formally, inverting a number is known as taking its reciprocal. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify each of the following expressions: Simplify: ( 7 4 )−1 a) 4−1 b) ( 2 3 )−1 c) ( −3 5 )−1 Solution: In each case, we simply invert the given number. a) 4−1 = 1 4 b) ( 2 3 )−1 = 3 2 c) ( −3 5 )−1 = −5 3 Solution: In each case, we simply invert the given number. a) 4−1 = 1 4 b) (−5)−1 = −1 5 c) ( 2 3 )−1 = 3 2 d) ( −3 5 )−1 = −5 3 Answer: 4 7 ! 7.1. NEGATIVE EXPONENTS 479 You might be asking “Why does raising to the power of minus one invert the number?” To answer this question, recall the product of a number and its reciprocal is one. For example, 4 · 1 4 = 1. (7.1) Next, consider what happens when we multiply 41 and 4−1. If we apply the usual law of exponents (assuming they work for both positive and negative exponents), we would add the exponents (1 + (−1) = 0). 41 · 4−1 = 40 (7.2) However, because 41 = 4 and 40 = 1, this last equation is equivalent to: 4 · 4−1 = 1 (7.3) When you compare Equation 7.1 and 7.3, it is clear that 4−1 and 1/4 are both reciprocals of the number 4. Because reciprocals are unique, 4−1 = 1/4. In similar fashion, one can discover the meaning of a−n. Start with the fact that multiplying reciprocals yields an answer of one. an · 1 an = 1 (7.4) If we multiply an and a−n, we add the exponents as follows. an · a−n = a0 Providing a != 0, then a0 = 1, so we can write an · a−n = 1 (7.5) Comparing Equations 7.4 and 7.5, we note that both 1/an and a−n are recip- rocals of an. Because every number has a unique reciprocal, a−n and 1/an are equal. Raising to a negative integer. Provided a != 0, a−n = 1 an . 480 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Simplify each of the following expressions:Simplify: 3−2 a) 2−3 b) (−5)−2 c) (−4)−3 Solution: In each example, we use the property a−n = 1/an to simplify the given expression. a) 2−3 = 1 23 = 1 8 b) (−5)−2 = 1 (−5)2 = 1 25 c) (−4)−3 = 1 (−4)3 = − 1 64 In Raising to a Negative Integer on page 482, we’ll address how you can per- form each of the above computations mentally.Answer: 1 9 !  || Laws of Exponents In the arguments demonstrating that 4−1 = 1/4 and a−n = 1/an, we appealed to one of the laws of exponents learned in Chapter 5, Section 5. Fortunately, the laws of exponents work exactly the same whether the exponents are positive or negative integers. Laws of Exponents. If m and n are integers, then: 1. aman = am+n 2. am an = am−n 3. (am)n = amn 4. (ab)n = anbn 5. (a b )n = an bn You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify each of the following expressions:Simplify: t8 · t−4 a) y5y−7 b) 2−2 · 2−3 c) x−4x6 Solution: In each case, we use the first law of exponents (aman = am+n). Be- cause we are multiplying like bases, we repeat the base and add the exponents. 7.1. NEGATIVE EXPONENTS 481 a) y5y−7 = y5+(−7) = y−2 b) 2−2 · 2−3 = 2−2+(−3) = 2−5 c) x−4x6 = x−4+6 = x2 Answer: t4 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Simplify each of the following expressions: Simplify: y−6 y−2 a) x4 x7 b) 3−4 35 c) z−3 z−5 Solution: In each case, we use the second law of exponents (am/an = am−n). Because we are dividing like bases, we repeat the base and subtract the expo- nents. Recall that subtraction means “add the opposite.” a) x4 x7 = x4−7 = x4+(−7) = x−3 b) 3−4 35 = 3−4−5 = 3−4+(−5) = 3−9 c) z−3 z−5 = z−3−(−5) = z−3+5 = z2 Answer: y−4 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify each of the following expressions: Simplify: (z5)−2 a) (5−2)3 b) (a−3)−4 c) (w2)−7 Solution: In each case, we are using the third law of exponents ((am)n = amn). Because we are raising a power to another power, we repeat the base and multiply the exponents. a) (5−2)3 = 5(−2)(3) = 5−6 b) (a−3)−4 = a(−3)(−4) = a12 c) (w2)−7 = w(2)(−7) = w−14 Answer: z−10 ! 482 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS  || Raising to a Negative Integer We know what happens when you raise a number to −1, you invert the number or turn it upside down. But what happens when you raise a number to a negative integer other than negative one? As an example, consider the expression 3−2. Using the third law of expo- nents ((am)n = amn), we can write this expression in two equivalent forms. 1. Note that 3−2 is equivalent to (32)−1. They are equivalent because the third law of exponents instructs us to multiply the exponents when raising a power to another power. Finally, note that to evaluate (32)−1, we first square, then invert the result. 3−2 = (32)−1 Repeat base and multiply exponents. = 9−1 Simplify: 32 = 9. = 1 9 Simplify: 9−1 = 1/9. 2. Note that 3−2 is also equivalent to (3−1)2. They are equivalent because the third law of exponents instructs us to multiply the exponents when raising a power to another power. Finally, note that to evaluate (3−1)2, we first invert, then square the result. 3−2 = (3−1)2 Repeat base and multiply exponents. = ( 1 3 )2 Simplify: 3−1 = 1/3. = 1 9 Simplify: (1/3)2 = 1/9. Using either technique, 3−2 = 1/9. You can either square and invert, or you can invert and square. In each case, the 2 means “square” and the minus sign means “invert,” and this example shows that it doesn’t matter which you do first. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Simplify each of the following expressions: Simplify: ( 5 4 )−3 a) 5−3 b) (−4)−2 c) ( 3 5 )−2 d) ( −2 3 )−3 Solution: a) We’ll cube then invert. 5−3 = (53)−1 Repeat base, multiply exponents. = 125−1 Simplify: 53 = 125. = 1 125 Invert: 125−1 = 1/125. 7.1. NEGATIVE EXPONENTS 483 Note that the three means “cube” and the minus sign means “invert,” so it is possible to do all of this work mentally: cube 5 to get 125, then invert to get 1/125. b) We’ll square then invert. (−4)−2 = ((−4)2)−1 Repeat base, multiply exponents. = 16−1 Simplify: (−4)2 = 16. = 1 16 Invert: 16−1 = 1/16. Note that the two means “square” and the minus sign means “invert,” so it is possible to do all of this work mentally: square −4 to get 16, then invert to get 1/16. c) Again, we’ll square then invert.( 3 5 )−2 = (( 3 5 )2)−1 Repeat base, multiply exponents. = ( 9 25 )−1 Simplify: (3/5)2 = 9/25. = 25 9 Invert: (9/25)−1 = 25/9. Note that the two means “square” and the minus sign means “invert,” so it is possible to do all of this work mentally: square 3/5 to get 9/25, then invert to get 25/9. d) This time we’ll cube then invert.( −2 3 )−3 = (( −2 3 )3)−1 Repeat base, multiply exponents. = ( − 8 27 )−1 Simplify: (−2/3)3 = −8/27. = −27 8 Invert: (−8/27)−1 = −27/8. Note that the three means “cube” and the minus sign means “invert,” so it is possible to do all of this work mentally: cube −2/3 to get −8/27, then invert to get −27/8. Answer: 64 125 ! 484 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS  || Applying the Laws of Exponents In this section we’ll simplify a few more complicated expressions using the laws of exponents. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Simplify: (2x−2y3)(−3x5y−6)Simplify: (−5x8y−2)(−2x−6y−1) Solution: All the operators involved are multiplication, so the commutative and associative properties of multiplication allow us to change the order and grouping. We’ll show this regrouping here, but this step can be done mentally. (2x−2y3)(−3x5y−6) = [(2)(−3)](x−2x5)(y3y−6) When multiplying, we repeat the base and add the exponents. = −6x−2+5y3+(−6) = −6x3y−3 In the solution above, we’ve probably shown way too much work. It’s far easier to perform all of these steps mentally, multiplying the 2 and the −3, then repeating bases and adding exponents, as in: (2x−2y3)(−3x5y−6) = −6x3y−3 Answer: 10x2y−3 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Simplify: 6x−2y5 9x3y−2Simplify: (10x3y−1) (4x−2y5) Solution: The simplest approach is to first write the expression as a product. 6x−2y5 9x3y−2 = 6 9 · x −2 x3 · y 5 y−2 Reduce 6/9 to lowest terms. Because we are dividing like bases, we repeat the base and subtract the exponents. = 2 3 x−2−3y5−(−2) = 2 3 x−2+(−3)y5+2 = 2 3 x−5y7 7.1. NEGATIVE EXPONENTS 485 In the solution above, we’ve probably shown way too much work. It’s far easier to imagine writing the expression as a product, reducing 6/9, then repeating bases and subtracting exponents, as in: 6x−2y5 9x3y−2 = 2 3 x−5y7 Answer: 5 2 x5y−6 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Simplify: (2x−2y4)−3 Simplify: (3x4y−3)−2 Solution: The fourth law of exponents ((ab)n = anbn) says that when you raise a product to a power, you must raise each factor to that power. So we begin by raising each factor to the minus three power. (2x−2y3)−3 = 2−3(x−2)−3(y4)−3 To raise two to the minus three, we must cube two and invert: 2−3 = 1/8. Secondly, raising a power to a power requires that we repeat the base and multiply exponents. = 1 8 x(−2)(−3)y(4)(−3) = 1 8 x6y−12 In the solution above, we’ve probably shown way too much work. It’s far easier raise each factor to the minus three mentally: 2−3 = 1/8, then multiply each exponent on the remaining factors by −3, as in (2x−2y4)−3 = 1 8 x6y−12 Answer: 1 9 x−8y6 !  || Clearing Negative Exponents Often, we’re asked to provide a final answer that is free of negative exponents. It is common to hear the instruction “no negative exponents in the final an- swer.” Let’s explore a couple of techniques that allow us to clear our answer of negative exponents. 486 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Consider the expression:Simplify the expression y5 x−2 so that the resulting equivalent expression contains no negative exponents. x2 y−3 Simplify so that the resulting equivalent expression contains no negative expo- nents. Solution: Raising y to the −3 means we have to cube and invert, so y−3 = 1/y3. x2 y−3 = x2 1 y3 To divide x2 by 1/y3, we invert and multiply. = x2 ÷ 1 y3 = x2 1 · y 3 1 = x2y3 Alternate approach: An alternate approach takes advantage of the laws of exponents. We begin by multiplying numerator and denominator by y3. x2 y−3 = x2 y−3 · y 3 y3 = x2y3 y0 = x2y3 In the last step, note how we used the fact that y0 = 1.Answer: y5x2 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Consider the expression:Simplify the expression x−3y2 3z−4 so that the resulting equivalent expression contains no negative exponents. 2x2y−2 z3 Simplify so that the resulting equivalent expression contains no negative expo- nents. 7.1. NEGATIVE EXPONENTS 487 Solution: Again, we can remove all the negative exponents by taking recip- rocals. In this case y−2 = 1/y2 (square and invert). 2x2y−2 z3 = 2x2 · 1 y2 z3 = 2x2 y2 z3 To divide 2x2/y2 by z3, we invert and multiply. = 2x2 y2 ÷ z3 = 2x2 y2 · 1 z3 = 2x2 y2z3 Alternate approach: An alternate approach again takes advantage of the laws of exponents. We begin by multiplying numerator and denominator by y2. 2x2y−2 z3 = 2x2y−2 z3 · y 2 y2 = 2x2y0 y2z3 = 2x2 y2z3 In the last step, note how we used the fact that y0 = 1.

The answer for 104 is a one followed by four zeros. Do you see the pattern? Nonnegative powers of ten. In the expression 10n, the exponent matches the number of zeros in the answer. Hence, 10n will be a 1 followed by n zeros. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify: 109.Simplify: 106 Solution. 109 should be a 1 followed by 9 zeros. 109 = 1, 000, 000, 000 Answer: 1, 000, 000 ! Next, let’s examine negative powers of ten. 10−1 = 1 10 = 0.1 10−2 = 1 100 = 0.01 10−3 = 1 1000 x = 0.001 10−4 = 1 10000 = 0.0001 Note that the answer for 10−3 has three decimal places and the answer for 10−4 contains four decimal places. Negative powers of ten. In the expression 10−n, the exponent matches the number of decimal places in the answer.

Therefore, we place the decimal point in the product so that there are six digits to the right of the decimal point. However, the trailing zeros may be removed without changing the value of the product. That is, 1.234567 times 1000 is 1234.567. Note that the decimal point in the product is three places further to the right than in the original factor. This observation leads to the following result. Multiplying by a nonnegative power of ten.

Therefore, we place the decimal point in the product so that there are 3 digits to the right of the decimal point. That is, 453.9 × 10−2 = 4.539. Note that the decimal point in the product is two places further to the left than in the original factor. This observation leads to the following result. Multiplying by a negative power of ten.

Multiplying by 10−4 will move the decimal point four places to the left.

SCIENTIFIC NOTATION 495  || Scientific Notation Form We start by defining the form of a number called scientific notation. Scientific notation. A number having the form a× 10b, where b is an integer and 1 ≤ |a| < 10, is said to be in scientific notation. The requirement 1 ≤ |a| < 10 says that the magnitude of a must be a least 1 and less than 10. • The number 12.34× 10−4 is not in scientific notation because |12.34| = 12.34 is larger than 10. • The number −0.95× 103 is not in scientific notation because |− 0.95| = 0.95 is less than 1. • The number 7.58× 10−12 is in scientific notation because |7.58| = 7.58 is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. • The number −1.0× 1015 is in scientific notation because |− 1.0| = 1.0 is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. After contemplating these examples, it follows that a number in scientific no- tation should have exactly one of the digits 1, 2, 3, . . . , 9 before the decimal point. Exactly one, no more, no less. Thus, each of the following numbers is in scientific notation. 4.7× 108, −3.764× 10−1, 3.2× 100, and − 1.25× 10−22  || Placing a Number in Scientific Notation To place a number into scientific notation, we need to move the decimal point so that exactly one of the digits 1, 2, 3, . . . , 9 remains to the left of the decimal point, then multiply by the appropriate power of 10 so that the result is equivalent to the original number.

Locate the “comma” key just about the number 7 key on the calculator’s keyboard (see Figure 7.1). Just above the “comma” key, printed on the calculator’s case is the symbol EE. It’s in the same color as the 2nd key, so you’ll have to use the 2nd key to access this symbol. Figure 7.1: Locate the EE label above the “comma” key on the keyboard. We know that 2.3 × 102 = 230.

Solution: Because the speed of light is measured in miles per second, let’s first compute the number of seconds in 4.37 years. Because there are 365 days in a year, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute, we can write: 4.37 yr = 4.37 yr× 365 day yr × 24 hr day × 60 min hr × 60 s min = 4.37"yr × 365 # #day "yr × 24 "hr ##day × 60 # #min "hr × 60 s ##min Note how the units cancel, indicating that the final answer is in seconds. With our calculator mode set to scientific notation (see the image on the right in Figure 7.2), we multiply the numbers to get the result shown in Figure 7.6. Rounding, the number of seconds in 4.37 years is approximately 1.38 × 108 seconds. Next, we compute the distance the light travels in 4.37 years. Using the fact that the distance traveled equals the speed times the time traveled, we have: Distance = Speed× Time = 1.86× 105 mi s · 1.38× 108 s = 1.86× 105 mi $s · 1.38× 108 $s Note how the units cancel, indicating that our answer is in miles.

Thus, the star Alpha Centauri is approximately 2.5668 × 1013 miles from the earth, or 2.5668× 1013 miles ≈ 25, 668, 000, 000, 000miles, pronounced “twenty-five quadrillion, six hundred sixty-eight trillion miles.” Answer: ≈ 5.2425× 1013 miles ! 502 CHAPTER 7.

We are not restricted to always using the letter k for our constant of propor- tionality. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Given that y is proportional to x and the fact that y = 12 Given that y is proportional to x and that y = 21 when x = 9, determine the value of y when x = 27. when x = 5, determine the constant of proportionality, then determine the value of y when x = 10. Solution: Given the fact the y is proportional to x, we know immediately that y = kx, where k is the proportionality constant. Because we are given that y = 12 when x = 5, we can substitute 12 for y and 5 for x to determine k. y = kx y is proportional to x. 12 = k(5) Substitute 12 for y, 5 for x. 12 5 = k Divide both sides by 5. Next, substitute the constant of proportionality 12/5 for k in y = kx, then substitute 10 for x to determine y when x = 10. y = 12 5 x Substitute 12/5 for k. y = 12 5 (10) Substitute 10 for x. y = 24 Cancel and simplify.

The distance s the ball falls is proportional to the square of the time t that has passed since the ball’s release. If the ball falls 50 feet during the first 5 seconds, how far does the ball fall in 8 seconds? of the earth. The distance s the ball falls is proportional to the square of the time t that has passed since the ball’s release. If the ball falls 144 feet during the first 3 seconds, how far does the ball fall in 9 seconds? Solution: Given the fact the s is proportional to the square of t, we know immediately that s = kt2, where k is the proportionality constant. Because we are given that the ball falls 144 feet during the first 3 seconds, we can substitute 144 for s and 3 for t to determine the constant of proportionality. s = kt2 s is proportional to the square of t. 144 = k(3)2 Substitute 144 for s, 3 for t. 144 = 9k Simplify: 32 = 9. 16 = k Divide both sides by 9. Next, substitute the constant of proportionality 16 for k in s = kt2, and then substitute 9 for t to determine the distance fallen when t = 9 seconds. s = 16t2 Substitute 16 for k. s = 16(9)2 Substitute 9 for t. s = 1296 Simplify. Thus, the ball falls 1,296 feet during the first 9 seconds.Answer: 128 feet ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Tony and Paul are hanging weights on a spring in the physicsIf a 0.75 pound weight stretches a spring 5 inches, how far will a 1.2 pound weight stretch the spring? lab. Each time a weight is hung, they measure the distance the spring stretches. They discover that the distance y that the spring stretches is proportional to the weight hung on the spring (Hooke’s Law). If a 0.5 pound weight stretches the spring 3 inches, how far will a 0.75 pound weight stretch the spring? Solution: Let W represent the weight hung on the spring. Let y represent the distance the spring stretches. We’re told that the distance y the spring stretches is proportional to the amount of weight W hung on the spring. Hence, we can write: y = kW y is proportional to W . 7.5. DIRECT AND INVERSE VARIATION 527 Substitute 3 for y, 0.5 for W , then solve for k. 3 = k(0.5) Substitute 3 for y, 0.5 for W . 3 0.5 = k Divide both sides by 0.5. k = 6 Simplify. Substitute 6 for k in y = kW to produce: y = 6W Substitute 6 for k in y = kW . To determine the distance the spring will stretch when 0.75 pounds are hung on the spring, substitute 0.75 for W . y = 6(0.75) Substitute 0.75 for W . y = 4.5 Simplify. Thus, the spring will stretch 4.5 inches. Answer: 8 inches !  || Inversely Proportional In Examples 1, 2, and 3, where one quantity was proportional to a second quantity, you may have noticed that when one quantity increased, the second quantity also increased. Vice-versa, when one quantity decreased, the second quantity also decreased. However, not all real-world situations follow this pattern. There are times when as one quantity increases, the related quantity decreases. For example, consider the situation where you increase the number of workers on a job and note that the time to finish the job decreases. This is an example of a quantity being inversely proportional to a second quantity. Inversely proportional. We say the y is inversely proportional to x if and only if y = k x , where k is a constant called the constant of proportionality. The phrase “y varies inversely as x” is an equivalent way of saying “y in inversely proportional to x.” Here are a few examples that translate the phrase “is inversely proportional to.” • Given that d is inversely proportional to t, we write d = k/t, where k is a constant. 528 CHAPTER 7. RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS • Given that y is inversely proportional to the cube of x, we write y = k/x3, where k is a constant. • Given that s is inversely proportional to the square of t, we write s = k/t2, where k is a constant.

Solution: Given the fact the y is inversely proportional to x, we know imme- diately that y = k x , where k is the proportionality constant. Because we are given that y = 4 when x = 2, we can substitute 4 for y and 2 for x to determine k. y = k x y is inversely proportional to x. 4 = k 2 Substitute 4 for y, 2 for x. 8 = k Multiply both sides by 2. Substitute 8 for k in y = k/x, then substitute 4 for x to determine y when x = 4. y = 8 x Substitue 8 for k. y = 8 4 Substitute 4 for x. y = 2 Reduce.

If the light intensity 5 feet from the light source is 3 foot-candles, what is the intensity of the light 15 feet from the light source? 7.5. DIRECT AND INVERSE VARIATION 529 Solution: Given the fact that the intensity I of the light is inversely propor- tional to the square of the distance d from the light source, we know immedi- ately that I = k d2 , where k is the proportionality constant. Because we are given that the intensity is I = 3 foot-candles at d = 5 feet from the light source, we can substitute 3 for I and 5 for d to determine k. I = k d2 I is inversely proportional to d2. 3 = k 52 Substitute 3 for I, 5 for d. 3 = k 25 Simplify. 75 = k Multiply both sides by 25. Substitute 75 for k in I = k/d2, then substitute 15 for d to determine I when d = 15. I = 75 d2 Substitute 75 for k. I = 75 152 Substitute 15 for d. I = 75 225 Simplify. I = 1 3 Reduce.

Suppose that the price per person for a camping experience is Suppose that the price per person for a tour is inversely proportional to the number of people who sign up for the tour. If 8 people sign up, the price per person is $70. What will be the price per person if 20 people sign up? inversely proportional to the number of people who sign up for the experience. If 10 people sign up, the price per person is $350. What will be the price per person if 50 people sign up? Solution: Let p represent the price per person and let N be the number of people who sign up for the camping experience.
