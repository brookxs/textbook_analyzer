Addition of Numbers with Unlike Signs The addition 2 + ( – 6), two numbers with unlike signs, can also be illustrated using the number line. Begin at 0, the origin. Since 2 is positive, move 2 units to the right. Since -6 is negative, move, from 2, 6 units to the left. We are now located at -4. We can suggest a rule for adding two numbers that have unlike signs by noting that if the signs are disregarded, 4 can be obtained by subtracting 2 from 6. But 2 and 6 are precisely the absolute values of 2 and -6. Also, notice that the sign of the number with the larger absolute value is negative and that the sign of the resulting sum is negative. Adding Numbers with Unlike Signs Addition of numbers with unlike signs: To add two real numbers that have unlike signs, subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and associate with this difference the sign of the number with the larger absolute value. Sample Set B Find the following sums. Example 10.23.  7 + ( – 2)       Subtract absolute values: 7 – 2 = 5. Attach the proper sign: "+." Thus, 7 + ( – 2) = + 5 or 7 + ( – 2) = 5. Example 10.24.  3 + ( – 11 )       Subtract absolute values: 11 – 3 = 8. Attach the proper sign: " – ." Thus, 3 + ( – 11) = – 8. Example 10.25.  The morning temperature on a winter's day in Lake Tahoe was -12 degrees. The afternoon temperature was 25 degrees warmer. What was the afternoon temperature? We need to find – 12 + 25.       Subtract absolute values: 25 – 12 = 16. Attach the proper sign: "+." Thus, – 12 + 25 = 13. Practice Set B Find the sums. Exercise 10.5.9.
