Exponential Notation Exponential Notation We have noted that multiplication is a description of repeated addition. Exponen­tial notation is a description of repeated multiplication. Suppose we have the repeated multiplication 8 ⋅ 8 ⋅ 8 ⋅ 8 ⋅ 8 Exponent The factor 8 is repeated 5 times. Exponential notation uses a superscript for the number of times the factor is repeated. The superscript is placed on the repeated factor, 8 5 , in this case. The superscript is called an exponent. The Function of an Exponent An exponent records the number of identical factors that are repeated in a multiplication. Sample Set A Write the following multiplication using exponents. Example 3.1.  3⋅3. Since the factor 3 appears 2 times, we record this as 32 Example 3.2.  62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62⋅62. Since the factor 62 appears 9 times, we record this as 629 Expand (write without exponents) each number. Example 3.3.  124 . The exponent 4 is recording 4 factors of 12 in a multiplication. Thus, 124 = 12⋅12⋅12⋅12 Example 3.4.  7063 . The exponent 3 is recording 3 factors of 706 in a multiplication. Thus, 7063 = 706⋅706⋅706 Practice Set A Write the following using exponents.
