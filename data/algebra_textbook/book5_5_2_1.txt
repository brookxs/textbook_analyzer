Ascending and Descending Powers When asked to simplify a polynomial expression, we should combine any like terms we find, and when possible, arrange the answer in ascending or descend- ing powers. 310 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify the following polynomial expression, arranging yourSimplify the following polynomial, and arrange your answer in ascending powers of x: 3x2−5x3+8x+9x2−7x+2x3 answer in descending powers of x. Once you’ve completed that task, make a second arrangement, ordering your terms in ascending powers of x. 2x3 + 7x− 3x2 + 11x+ 8x2 + 11 + 15x Solution: In order to arrange our answer in descending powers of x, we want to place the term with the highest power of x first and the term with the lowest power of x last. We use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup, then we combine like terms. 2x3 + 7x− 3x2 + 11x+ 8x2 + 11 + 15x = 2x3 + (−3x2 + 8x2) + (7x+ 11x+ 15x) + 11 = 2x3 + 5x2 + 33x+ 11 Note how the powers of x start at 3, then go down in order. To arrange our final answer in ascending powers of x, we put the lowest power of x first, then the highest power of x last, regrouping and combining like terms. 2x3 + 7x− 3x2 + 11x+ 8x2 + 11 + 15x = 11 + (7x+ 11x+ 15x) + (−3x2 + 8x2) + 2x3 = 11 + 33x+ 5x2 + 2x3 Note how we start with the constant term, then the powers of x increase in order.Answer: x+ 12x2 − 3x3 ! When we have a polynomial in a single variable, such as the polynomial in Example 1, arranging the terms in ascending or descending order is fairly straightforward. However, a polynomial in two or more variables is a bit more difficult, and sometimes impossible, to arrange in a decent order. You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. Simplify the following polynomial expression, then arrangeSimplify the following polynomial, and arrange your answer in descending powers of x: −4x2y2 + 3xy3+ 6x3y − xy3 + 2x2y2 your answer in descending powers of x. x3 + 2xy2 − 6x2y + y3 − 3xy2 + 4x2y Solution: We’ll again use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup, putting the terms with the highest powers of x 5.2. POLYNOMIALS 311 first, then follow with terms containing lower powers of x in order. x3 + 2xy2 − 6x2y + y3 − 3xy2 + 4x2y = x3 + (−6x2y + 4x2y) + (2xy2 − 3xy2) + y3 = x3 − 2x2y − xy2 + y3 Note that this is a very natural order, the powers of x decrease while simulta- neously the powers of y increase. Answer: 6x3y − 2x2y2 + 2xy3 ! Not all examples will have nice ordering presented in Example 2, with the powers of one variable descending while the powers of the other variable simul- taneously ascends. Sometimes we have to make some very subjective choices on the ordering of terms. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. Simplify the following polynomial expression, then arrange Simplify the following polynomial, and arrange your answer in ascending powers of b: 5a3b2 + 4ab3 − 2a2b+ 3a3b2 − ab3 your answer in some sort of reasonable order. a3b3 + 2a2b− 3a2b3 + 4a3b3 + 5a4 + 3a2b+ b5 Solution: Let’s try to arrange the terms so that the powers of a descend. Again, we use the commutative and associative properties to change the order and regroup. a3b3 + 2a2b− 3a2b3 + 4a3b3 + 5a4 + 3a2b+ b5 = 5a4 + (a3b3 + 4a3b3) + (2a2b + 3a2b)− 3a2b3 + b5 = 5a4 + 5a3b3 + 5a2b− 3a2b3 + b5 Note that in our final arrangement, the powers of a descend, but the powers of b bounce up and down, but at least we have the powers of a descending. That should help us spot if we’ve missed a term while simplifying the given problem. Answer: −2a2b+ 8a3b2 + 3ab3 !
