6.7 Applications of Factoring In this section we will solve applications whose solutions involve factoring. Let’s begin. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. A rectangular canvas picture measures 12 inches by 16 inches. A rectangular canvas picture measures 7 inches by 11 inches. The canvas is mounted inside a frame of uniform width, increasing the total area covered by both canvas and frame to 117 square inches. Find the uniform width of the frame. The canvas is mounted inside a frame of uniform width, increasing the total area covered by both canvas and frame to 396 square inches. Find the uniform width of the frame. Solution: We follow the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a variable dictionary. A carefully labeled figure will help us main- tain our focus. We’ll let x represent the uniform width of the frame. 12 + 2x 16 + 2x 12 + 2x 16 + 2x 12 16 12 16 xx x x 2. Set up an equation. If the inner rectangular dimensions are 16 inches by 12 inches, adding a frame of uniform width x makes the dimensions of the frame plus canvas 16 + 2x inches by 12 + 2x inches. The total area is found by multiplying these outer dimensions, A = (16 + 2x)(12 + 2x). If the total area is A = 396 square inches, then we have the following equation. (16 + 2x)(12 + 2x) = 396 3. Solve the equation. We start by expanding the right-hand side of the equation. (16 + 2x)(12 + 2x) = 396 192 + 56x+ 4x2 = 396 The resulting equation is nonlinear. Make one side zero. 4x2 + 56x− 204 = 0 468 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING We could factor out 4 on the left-hand side, but since there is a zero on the right-hand side of the equation, it’s a bit easier to simply divide both sides by 4. Note how we divide each term on the left-hand side by the number 4. x2 + 14x− 51 = 0 We need an integer pair whose product is ac = −51 and whose sum is b = 14. The integer pair −3, 17 comes to mind. Since the coefficient of x2 is one, we can simply “drop in place” our ordered pair. (x− 3)(x+ 17) = 0 Thus, the solutions are x = 3 and x = −17. 4. Answer the question. The uniform width of the frame cannot be −17 inches, so we eliminate this solution from consideration. Hence, the uni- form width of the frame is 3 inches. 5. Look back. If the uniform width of the frame is 3 inches, then the final dimensions will look like the following. 18 22 18 22 12 16 12 16 33 3 3 Thus, the combined area of the frame plus canvas is A = (18)(22), or A = 396 square inches, the area given in the problem statement. Our solution is correct. Answer: 1 inch ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 2. A projectile is fired at an angle into the air from atop a cliffA projectile’s height (in feet) is given by the equation y = −16t2 + 144t+ 576, where time t is measured in seconds. How much time passes before the projectile hits the ground? overlooking the ocean. The projectile’s distance (in feet) from the base of the cliff is give by the equation x = 120t, (6.1) 6.7. APPLICATIONS OF FACTORING 469 and the projectile’s height above sea level (in feet) is given by the equation y = −16t2 + 288t+ 640, (6.2) where t is the amount of time (in seconds) that has passed since the projectile’s release. a) How much time passes before the projectile splashes into the ocean? b) At that time, how far is the projectile from the base of the cliff? Solution: We follow the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a variable dictionary. The variables are already set up for us. x = Distance from base of the cliff (in feet). y = Height above sea level (in feet). t = Time since projectile’s release (in seconds). 2. Set up an equation. The equations are already set up (see equation 6.1 and equation 6.2). 3. Solve the equation. When the projectile splashes into the ocean, its height above sea level at that moment is y = 0 feet. Substitute 0 for y in equation 6.2 and solve the resulting equation for t. y = −16t2 + 288t+ 640 0 = −16t2 + 288t+ 640 We could factor out −16, but since the left-hand side of this equation is zero, it’s a bit easier to divide both sides by −16. Note how we divide each term on the right-hand side by −16. 0 = t2 − 18t− 40 We need a pair of integers so that their product is ac = −40 and their sum is −18. The integer pair 2,−20 comes to mind. Since the coefficient of t2 is one, we can “drop in place” our integer pair. 0 = (t+ 2)(t− 20) Hence, the solutions are t = −2 and t = 20. 4. Answer the question. In answering question (a), the solution t = −2 seconds makes no sense. Thus, the projectile splashes into the ocean at t = 20 seconds. 470 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING In addressing question (b), to find the projectile’s distance from the base of the cliff at this moment, substitute t = 20 in equation 6.1. x = 120t x = 120(20) x = 2400 Hence, at the moment the projectile splashes into the ocean, it is 2,400 feet from the base of the cliff. 5. Look back. The best we can do here is check our solution t = 20 in equation 6.2. y = −16t2 + 288t+ 640 y = −16(20)2 + 288(20) + 640 y = −6400 + 5760 + 640 y = 0 Indeed, at t = 20, the projectile does splash into the ocean. Answer: 12 seconds ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. The product of two consecutive even integers is 728. FindThe product of two consecutive positive odd integers is 483. Find the integers. the integers. Solution: We follow the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a variable dictionary. Let k represent the first even integer. Then k + 2 represents the next consecutive even integer. 2. Set up an equation. The product of the integers is 728. Hence, we have the following equation. k(k + 2) = 728 3. Solve the equation. Expand the left-hand side of the equation. k2 + 2k = 728 The equation is nonlinear. Make one side zero. k2 + 2k − 728 = 0 See Using the Calculator to Assist the ac-Method on page 462. We need an integer pair whose product is ac = −728 and whose sum is b = 2. Enter -728/X in Y1, then set up the table (see Figure 6.31). 6.7. APPLICATIONS OF FACTORING 471 Figure 6.31: Load ac/X , or -728/X into Y1 in the Y= menu. Use the up- and down-arrow keys to scroll. Note that 28,−26 is the desired pair. Because the coefficient of k2 is one, we can “drop in place” the ordered pair. 0 = (k + 28)(k − 26) Hence, the solutions are k = −28 and k = 26. 4. Answer the question. If k = −28, the next consecutive even integer is k + 2 = −26. Secondly, if k = 26, the next consecutive even integer is k + 2 = 28. 5. Look back. Our first pair is −28 and −26. They have the required product of 728. Our second pair is 26 and 28. Their product is also 728. Both solutions check! Answer: 21 and 23 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. A rectangle has perimeter 54 feet and area 180 square feet. A rectangle has perimeter 62 feet and area 234 square feet. Find the dimensions of the rectangle. Find the dimensions of the rectangle. Solution: We follow the Requirements for Word Problem Solutions. 1. Set up a variable dictionary. A sketch will help us keep our focus. Let L represent the length of the rectangle and let W represent its width. L W L W 472 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING 2. Set up an equation. The perimeter is 54 feet, so 2W+2L = 54, or dividing both sides by 2: W + L = 27 (6.3) The area is 180 square feet, so: LW = 180 (6.4) 3. Solve the equation. The system of equations (equations 6.3 and 6.4) can be solved using the substitution method. First, solve equation 6.3 for W : W = 27− L (6.5) Substitute equation 6.5 in equation 6.4, expand, then make one side zero. L(27− L) = 180 27L− L2 = 180 0 = L2 − 27L+ 180 The integer pair −12,−15 has product ac = 180 and sum b = −27. Moreover, the coefficient of L2 is one, so we can “drop in place” our integer pair. 0 = (L− 12)(L− 15) Hence, the solutions are L = 12 and L = 15. 4. Answer the question. Two possibilities for the width. Substitute L = 12 in (6.5). W = 27− L W = 27− 12 W = 15 Substitute L = 15 in (6.5). W = 27− L W = 27− 15 W = 12 Both answers give the same 15 by 12 foot rectangle, but we usually think of the term “length” as the longer side of the rectangle. So let’s go with the length is L = 15 feet and the width is W = 12 feet. 5. Look back. Let’s add L = 15 feet and W = 12 feet to a diagram. 15 ft 12 ft 15 ft 12 ft 6.7. APPLICATIONS OF FACTORING 473 If we add the dimensions around the rectangle, the perimeter is P = 15+ 12 + 15 + 12, or P = 54 feet, the perimeter required in the problem statement. Next, if we multiply the dimensions, then A = (15)(12), or A = 180 square feet, the area required in the problem statement. Our solution is correct! Answer: length = 18 feet and width = 13 feet ! 474 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING ! ! ! 6.7 Applications of Factoring In this section we will solve applications whose solutions involve factoring. Let’s begin.
