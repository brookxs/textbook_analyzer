Dividing A Polynomial By A Polynomial Now we’ll observe some examples of dividing one polynomial by another. The process is the same as the process used with whole numbers: divide, multiply, subtract, divide, multiply, subtract,.... The division, multiplication, and subtraction take place one term at a time. The process is concluded when the polynomial remainder is of lesser degree than the polynomial divisor.
