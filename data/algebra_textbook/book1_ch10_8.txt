 || Parabolas We will now study the graphs of quadratic equations in two variables with general form Parabola All such graphs have a similar shape. The graph of a quadratic equation of this type Parabola is called a parabola and it will assume one of the following shapes. Vertex The high point or low point of a parabola is called the vertex of the parabola.  || Constructing Graphs of Parabolas We will construct the graph of a parabola by choosing several x -values, computing to find the corresponding y -values, plotting these ordered pairs, then drawing a smooth curve through them.  ||
