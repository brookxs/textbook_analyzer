Finding the Percent Sample Set B Example 7.42.  Recall that (missing factor) = (product) ÷ (known factor). Thus, 15 is 30% of 50. Do the section called “Practice Set B”, Exercise 7.7.5.. Example 7.43.  Thus, 4.32 is 6% of 72. Do the section called “Practice Set B”, Exercise 7.7.5.. Example 7.44.  On a 160 question exam, a student got 125 correct answers. What percent is this? Round the result to two decimal places. We need to determine the percent. Thus, this student received a 78% on the exam. Do the section called “Practice Set B”, Exercise 7.7.6.. Example 7.45.  A bottle contains 80 milliliters of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and 30 milliliters of water. What percent of HCl does the bottle contain? Round the result to two decimal places. We need to determine the percent. The total amount of liquid in the bottle is 80 milliliters + 30 milliliters = 110 milliliters . Thus, this bottle contains approximately 73% HCl. Do the section called “Practice Set B”, Exercise 7.7.7.. Example 7.46.  Five years ago a woman had an annual income of $19,200. She presently earns $42,000 annually. By what percent has her salary increased? Round the result to two decimal places. We need to determine the percent. Thus, this woman's annual salary has increased 219%. Practice Set B Exercise 7.7.5. (Go to Solution) 99.13 is what percent of 431? Exercise 7.7.6. (Go to Solution) On an 80 question exam, a student got 72 correct answers. What percent did the student get on the exam? Exercise 7.7.7. (Go to Solution) A bottle contains 45 milliliters of sugar and 67 milliliters of water. What fraction of sugar does the bottle contain? Round the result to two decimal places (then express as a percent). Finding the Percent Sample Set B Example 7.42.  Recall that (missing factor) = (product) ÷ (known factor). Thus, 15 is 30% of 50.
