 || Binomial A binomial has two terms: x + 1 5x2 – 3x  || Degree of a Term The degree of an individual term in a polynomial is the sum of powers of all the variables in that term. We only have to use the plurals in this definition because of the possibility that there may be more than one variable. In practice, you will most often see polynomials that have only one variable (traditionally denoted by the letter ‘x’). In that case, the degree will simply be the power of the variable. Examples:  2x3 Degree = 3 3x4 Degree = 4 x Degree = 1 3x2y5 Degree = 7 (because 2 + 5 = 7) 37 Degree = 0 Why is the last example, which is just a plain number, considered to be of degree zero? It is because of the fact that x0 = 1, and everything has a factor of 1. So we can say that 37 is the coefficient of x0.  || Degree of a Polynomial The degree of the entire polynomial is the degree of the highest-degree term that it contains, so x2 + 2x – 7 is a second-degree trinomial, and x4 – 7x3  is a fourth-degree binomial.  ||
