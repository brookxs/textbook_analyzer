6.1 The Greatest Common Factor We begin this section with definitions of factors and divisors. Because 24 = 2 · 12, both 2 and 12 are factors of 24. However, note that 2 is also a divisor of 24, because when you divide 24 by 2 you get 12, with a remainder of zero. Similarly, 12 is also a divisor of 24, because when you divide 24 by 12 you get 2, with a remainder of zero. Factors and divisors. Suppose m and n are integers. Then m is a divisor (factor) of n if and only if there exists another integer k so that n = m · k. The words divisor and factor are equivalent. They have the same meaning. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1.

THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR 387 Greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor (factor) of a and b is the largest positive number that divides evenly (no remainder) both a and b. The greatest common divisor of a and b is denoted by the symbolism GCD(a, b). We will also use the abbreviation GCF(a, b) to represents the greatest common factor of a and b. Remember, greatest common divisor and greatest common factor have the same meaning. In Example 2, we listed the common positive divisors of 36 and 48. The largest of these common divisors was 12. Hence, the greatest common divisor (factor) of 36 and 48 is 12, written GCD(36, 48) = 12. With smaller numbers, it is usually easy to identify the greatest common divisor (factor). You Try It!

In this case, the factors 2 and 3 appear in common, with 22 being the high- est power of 2 and 32 being the highest power of 3 that appear in common. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of 360 and 756 is: GCD(360, 756) = 22 · 32 = 4 · 9 = 36 Therefore, the greatest common divisor (factor) is GCD(360, 756) = 36. Note what happens when we write each of the given numbers as a product of the greatest common factor and a second factor: 360 = 36 · 10 756 = 36 · 21 In each case, note how the second second factors (10 and 21) contain no addi- tional common factors.Answer: 30 ! 6.1 The Greatest Common Factor We begin this section with definitions of factors and divisors.

Finding the GCF of two or more monomials. To find the greatest com- mon factor of two or more monomials, proceed as follows: 6.1. THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR 389 1. Find the greatest common factor (divisor) of the coefficients of the given monomials. Use prime factorization if necessary. 2. List each variable that appears in common in the given monomials. 3. Raise each variable that appears in common to the highest power that appears in common among the given monomials. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Find the greatest common factor of 6x3y3 and 9x2y5. Find the greatest common factor of 16xy3 and 12x4y2. Solution: To find the GCF of 6x3y3 and 9x2y5, we note that: 1. The greatest common factor (divisor) of 6 and 9 is 3. 2. The monomials 6x3y3 and 9x2y5 have the variables x and y in common. 3. The highest power of x in common is x2. The highest power of y in common is y3. Thus, the greatest common factor is GCF(6x3y3, 9x2y5) = 3x2y3. Note what happens when we write each of the given monomials as a product of the greatest common factor and a second monomial: 6x3y3 = 3x2y3 · 2x 9x2y5 = 3x2y3 · 3y Observe that the set of second monomial factors (2x and 3y) contain no addi- tional common factors. Answer: 4xy2 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Find the greatest common factor of 12x4, 18x3, and 30x2. Find the greatest common factor of 6y3, 15y2, and 9y5. Solution: To find the GCF of 12x4, 18x3, and 30x2, we note that: 1. The greatest common factor (divisor) of 12, 18, and 30 is 6. 2. The monomials 12x4, 18x3, and 30x2 have the variable x in common. 3. The highest power of x in common is x2. 390 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING Thus, the greatest common factor is GCF(12x4, 18x3, 30x2) = 6x2. Note what happens when we write each of the given monomials as a product of the greatest common factor and a second monomial: 12x4 = 6x2 · 2x2 18x3 = 6x2 · 3x 30x2 = 6x2 · 5 Observe that the set of second monomial factors (2x2, 3x, and 5) contain no additional common factors.Answer: 3y2 !  || Factor Out the GCF In Chapter 5, we multiplied a monomial and polynomial by distributing the monomial times each term in the polynomial. 2x(3x2 + 4x− 7) = 2x · 3x2 + 2x · 4x− 2x · 7 = 6x3 + 8x2 − 14x In this section we reverse that multiplication process. We present you with the final product and ask you to bring back the original multiplication problem. In the case 6x3 + 8x2 − 14x, the greatest common factor of 6x3, 8x2, and 14x is 2x. We then use the distributive property to factor out 2x from each term of the polynomial. 6x3 + 8x2 − 14x = 2x · 3x2 + 2x · 4x− 2x · 7 = 2x(3x2 + 4x− 7) Factoring. Factoring is “unmultiplying.” You are given the product, then asked to find the original multiplication problem. First rule of factoring. If the terms of the given polynomial have a greatest common factor (GCF), then factor out the GCF. Let’s look at a few examples that factor out the GCF. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Factor: 6x2 + 10x+ 14Factor: 9y2 − 15y + 12 6.1. THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR 391 Solution: The greatest common factor (GCF) of 6x2, 10x and 14 is 2. Factor out the GCF. 6x2 + 10x+ 14 = 2 · 3x2 + 2 · 5x+ 2 · 7 = 2(3x2 + 5x+ 7) Checking your work. Every time you factor a polynomial, remultiply to check your work. Check: Multiply. Distribute the 2. 2(3x2 + 5x+ 7) = 2 · 3x2 + 2 · 5x+ 2 · 7 = 6x2 + 10x+ 14 That’s the original polynomial, so we factored correctly. Answer: 3(3y2 − 5y + 4) ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Factor: 12y5 − 32y4 + 8y2 Factor: 8x6 + 20x4 − 24x3 Solution: The greatest common factor (GCF) of 12y5, 32y4 and 8y2 is 4y2. Factor out the GCF. 12y5 − 32y4 + 8y2 = 4y2 · 3y3 − 4y2 · 8y2 + 4y2 · 2 = 4y2(3y3 − 8y2 + 2) Check: Multiply. Distribute the monomial 4y2. 4y2(3y3 − 8y2 + 2) = 4y2 · 3y3 − 4y2 · 8y2 + 4y2 · 2 = 12y5 − 32y4 + 8y2 That’s the original polynomial. We have factored correctly. Answer: 4x3(2x3 + 5x− 6) !

Factor out the GCF. 12a3b+ 24a2b2 + 12ab3 = 12ab · a2 − 12ab · 2ab+ 12ab · b2 = 12ab(a2 + 2ab+ b2) 392 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING Check: Multiply. Distribute the monomial 12ab. 12ab(a2 + 2ab+ b2) = 12ab · a2 − 12ab · 2ab+ 12ab · b2 = 12a3b+ 24a2b2 + 12ab3 That’s the original polynomial. We have factored correctly.Answer: 3s2t2(5t2 + 2s+ 3) !  || Speeding Things Up a Bit Eventually, after showing your work on a number of examples such as those in Examples 7, 8, and 9, you’ll need to learn how to perform the process mentally. You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Factor each of the following polynomials: (a) 24x+ 32,Factor: 18p5q4 − 30p4q5 + 42p3q6 (b) 5x3 − 10x2 − 10x, and (c) 2x4y + 2x3y2 − 6x2y3. Solution: In each case, factor out the greatest common factor (GCF): a) The GCF of 24x and 32 is 8. Thus, 24x+ 32 = 8(3x+ 4) b) The GCF of 5x3, 10x2, and 10x is 5x. Thus: 5x3 − 10x2 − 10x = 5x(x2 − 2x− 2) c) The GCF of 2x4y, 2x3y2, and 6x2y3 is 2x2y. Thus: 2x4y + 2x3y2 − 6x2y3 = 2x2y(x2 + xy − 3y2) As you speed things up by mentally factoring out the GCF, it is even more important that you check your results. The check can also be done mentally. For example, in checking the third result, mentally distribute 2x2y times each term of x2 +xy− 3y2. Multiplying 2x2y times the first term x2 produces 2x4y, the first term in the original polynomial. 2x2y (x2 + xy − 3y2) = 2x4y + 2x3y2 − 6x2y3 Continue in this manner, mentally checking the product of 2x2y with each term of x2 + xy − 3y2, making sure that each result agrees with the corresponding term of the original polynomial.Answer: 6p3q4(3p2 − 5pq + 7q2) ! Remember that the distributive property allows us to pull the GCF out in front of the expression or to pull it out in back. In symbols: ab+ ac = a(b + c) or ba+ ca = (b+ c)a 6.1.

Factor: 2x(3x+ 2) + 5(3x+ 2) Factor: 3x2(4x− 7) + 8(4x− 7) Solution: In this case, the greatest common factor (GCF) is 3x+ 2. 2x(3x+ 2) + 5(3x+ 2) = 2x · (3x+ 2) + 5 · (3x+ 2) = (2x+ 5)(3x+ 2) Because of the commutative property of multiplication, it is equally valid to pull the GCF out in front. 2x(3x+ 2) + 5(3x+ 2) = (3x+ 2) · 2x+ (3x+ 2) · 5 = (3x+ 2)(2x+ 5) Note that the order of factors differs from the first solution, but because of the commutative property of multiplication, the order does not matter. The answers are the same. Answer: (3x2 + 8)(4x− 7) ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 12. Factor: 15a(a+ b)− 12(a+ b) Factor: 24m(m− 2n) + 20(m− 2n) Solution: In this case, the greatest common factor (GCF) is 3(a+ b). 15a(a+ b)− 12(a+ b) = 3(a+ b) · 5a− 3(a+ b) · 4 = 3(a+ b)(5a− 4) Alternate solution: It is possible that you might fail to notice that 15 and 12 are divisible by 3, factoring out only the common factor a+ b. 15a(a+ b)− 12(a+ b) = 15a · (a+ b)− 12 · (a+ b) = (15a− 12)(a+ b) However, you now need to notice that you can continue, factoring out 3 from both 15a and 12. = 3(5a− 4)(a+ b) Note that the order of factors differs from the first solution, but because of the commutative property of multiplication, the order does not matter. The answers are the same. Answer: 4(6m+ 5)(m− 2n) ! 394 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING  || Factoring by Grouping The final factoring skill in this section involves four-term expressions. The technique for factoring a four-term expression is called factoring by grouping. You Try It! EXAMPLE 13. Factor by grouping: x2 + 8x+ 3x+ 24Factor by grouping: x2 − 6x+ 2x− 12 Solution: We “group” the first and second terms, noting that we can factor an x out of both of these terms. Then we “group” the third and fourth terms, noting that we can factor 3 out of both of these terms. x2 + 8x+ 3x+ 24 = x (x + 8) + 3 (x+ 8) Now we can factor x+ 8 out of both of these terms. = (x + 3)(x+ 8) Answer: (x+ 2)(x− 6) ! Let’s try a grouping that contains some negative signs. You Try It! EXAMPLE 14. Factor by grouping: x2 + 4x− 7x− 28Factor by grouping: x2 − 5x− 4x+ 20 Solution: We “group” the first and second terms, noting that we can factor x out of both of these terms. Then we “group” the third and fourth terms, then try to factor a 7 out of both these terms. x2 + 4x− 7x− 28 = x (x + 4) + 7 (−x− 4) This does not lead to a common factor. Let’s try again, this time factoring a −7 out of the third and fourth terms. x2 + 4x− 7x− 28 = x (x + 4)− 7 (x+ 4) That worked! We now factor out a common factor x+ 4. = (x − 7)(x+ 4) Answer: (x− 4)(x− 5) ! 6.1. THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR 395 Let’s increase the size of the numbers a bit. You Try It! EXAMPLE 15. Factor by grouping: 6x2 − 8x+ 9x− 12 Factor by grouping: 15x2 + 9x+ 10x+ 6 Solution: Note that we can factor 2x out of the first two terms and 3 out of the second two terms. 6x2 − 8x+ 9x− 12 = 2x (3x− 4) + 3 (3x− 4) Now we have a common factor 3x− 4 which we can factor out. = (2x+ 3)(3x− 4) Answer: (3x+ 2)(5x+ 3) ! As the numbers get larger and larger, you need to factor out the GCF from each grouping. If not, you won’t get a common factor to finish the factoring. You Try It! EXAMPLE 16. Factor by grouping: 24x2 − 32x− 45x+ 60 Factor by grouping: 36x2 − 84x+ 15x− 35 Solution: Suppose that we factor 8x out of the first two terms and −5 out of the second two terms. 24x2 − 32x− 45x+ 60 = 8x (3x− 4)− 5 (9x− 12) That did not work, as we don’t have a common factor to complete the factoring process. However, note that we can still factor out a 3 from 9x− 12. As we’ve already factored out a 5, and now we see can factor out an additional 3, this means that we should have factored out 3 times 5, or 15, to begin with. Let’s start again, only this time we’ll factor 15 out of the second two terms. 24x2 − 32x− 45x+ 60 = 8x (3x− 4)− 15 (3x− 4) Beautiful! We can now factor out 3x− 4. = (8x− 15)(3x− 4) Answer: (12x+ 5)(3x− 7) ! 396 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING ! ! !  ||
