Solving Mentally After Factoring Let’s consider problems 4 and 5 of Sample Set A in more detail. Let’s look particularly at the factorizations ( 2x − 3 )( x + 5 ) = 0 and ( 9x + 2 )( 7x − 3 ) = 0. The next step is to set each factor equal to zero and solve. We can solve mentally if we understand how to solve linear equations: we transpose the constant from the variable term and then divide by the coefficient of the variable.
