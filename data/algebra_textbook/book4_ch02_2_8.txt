The Multiplication Process With a Multiple Digit Multiplier In a multiplication in which the multiplier is composed of two or more digits, the multiplication must take place in parts. The process is as follows: Part 1: First Partial Product Multiply the multiplicand by the ones digit of the multiplier. This product is called the first partial product. Part 2: Second Partial Product Multiply the multiplicand by the tens digit of the multiplier. This product is called the second partial product. Since the tens digit is used as a factor, the second partial product is written below the first partial product so that its rightmost digit appears in the tens column. Part 3: If necessary, continue this way finding partial products. Write each one below the previous one so that the rightmost digit appears in the column directly below the digit that was used as a factor. Part 4: Total Product Add the partial products to obtain the total product. Note It may be necessary to carry when finding each partial product. Sample Set C Example 2.6.  Multiply 326 by 48. Part 1: Part 2: Part 3: This step is unnecessary since all of the digits in the multiplier have been used. Part 4: Add the partial products to obtain the total product. The product is 15,648. Example 2.7.  Multiply 5,369 by 842. Part 1: Part 2: Part 3: The product is 4,520,698. Example 2.8.  Multiply 1,508 by 206. Part 1: Part 2: Since 0 times 1508 is 0, the partial product will not change the identity of the total product (which is obtained by addition). Go to the next partial product. Part 3: The product is 310,648 Practice Set C Exercise 2.2.10. (Go to Solution) Multiply 73 by 14. Exercise 2.2.11. (Go to Solution) Multiply 86 by 52. Exercise 2.2.12.
