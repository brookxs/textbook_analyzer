Absolute Value The absolute value (or magnitude) of an integer is defined as follows. The Absolute Value of an Integer. If a is an integer, then the absolute value of a, written |a|, is defined as the distance between the integer and zero on the number line. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Simplify |− 4|.Simplify: |− 23| Solution: Consider the position of −4 on the number line. Note that −4 lies four units away from zero. −7 −6 −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 units Because the absolute value (magnitude) of an integer equals its distance from zero, |− 4| = 4.Answer: |− 23| = 23 ! In similar fashion: • The integer 5 lies five units away from zero. Hence, |5| = 5. • The integer 0 lies zero units away from zero, Hence, |0| = 0. Note that the absolute value of any number is either positive or zero. That is, the absolute value of a number is nonnegative (not negative). 1.1.
