The Five-Step Method We are now in a position to study some applications of quadratic equations. Quadratic equations can arise from a variety of physical (applied) and mathematical (logical) problems. We will, again, apply the five-step method for solving word problems. Five-Step Method of Solving Word Problems Step 1:   Let x (or some other letter) represent the unknown quantity. Step 2:   Translate the verbal expression to mathematical symbols and form an equation. Step 3:   Solve this equation. Step 4:   Check the solution by substituting the result into the equation found in step 2. Step 5:   Write a conclusion. Remember, step 1 is very important. ALWAYS START BY INTRODUCING A VARIABLE. Once the quadratic equation is developed (step 2), try to solve it by factoring. If factoring doesn’t work, use the quadratic formula. A calculator may help to make some of the calculations a little less tedious. The Five-Step Method We are now in a position to study some applications of quadratic equations.
