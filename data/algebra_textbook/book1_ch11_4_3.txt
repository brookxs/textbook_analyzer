The Addition Method To solve a system of two linear equations in two variables by addition, Write, if necessary, both equations in general form, a x + b y = c. If necessary, multiply one or both equations by factors that will produce opposite coefficients for one of the variables. Add the equations to eliminate one equation and one variable. Solve the equation obtained in step 3. Do one of the following: (a)  Substitute the value obtained in step 4 into either of the original equations and solve to obtain the value of the other variable, or (b)  Repeat steps 1-5 for the other variable. Check the solutions in both equations. Write the solution as an ordered pair. The addition method works well when the coefficient of one of the variables is 1 or a number other than 1.
