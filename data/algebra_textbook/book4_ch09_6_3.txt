Area Formulas We can determine the areas of these geometric figures using the following formulas. Table 9.5.   Figure Area Formula Statement Triangle Area of a triangle is one half the base times the height. Rectangle A R = l ⋅ w Area of a rectangle is the length times the width. Parallelogram A P = b ⋅ h Area of a parallelogram is base times the height. Trapezoid Area of a trapezoid is one half the sum of the two bases times the height. Circle A C = πr 2 Area of a circle is π times the square of the radius. Area Formulas We can determine the areas of these geometric figures using the following formulas.
