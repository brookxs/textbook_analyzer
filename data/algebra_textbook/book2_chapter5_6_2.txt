Scientific Notation Real numbers expressed in scientific notation Real numbers expressed in the form a × 10 n , where n is an integer and 1 ≤ a < 10 . have the form where n is an integer and 1 ≤ a < 10 . This form is particularly useful when the numbers are very large or very small. For example, It is cumbersome to write all the zeros in both of these cases. Scientific notation is an alternative, compact representation of these numbers. The factor 10 n indicates the power of 10 to multiply the coefficient by to convert back to decimal form: This is equivalent to moving the decimal in the coefficient fifteen places to the right. A negative exponent indicates that the number is very small: This is equivalent to moving the decimal in the coefficient eleven places to the left. Converting a decimal number to scientific notation involves moving the decimal as well. Consider all of the equivalent forms of 0.00563 with factors of 10 that follow: While all of these are equal, 5.63 × 10 − 3 is the only form considered to be expressed in scientific notation. This is because the coefficient 5.63 is between 1 and 10 as required by the definition. Notice that we can convert 5.63 × 10 − 3 back to decimal form, as a check, by moving the decimal to the left three places.   Example 11: Write 1,075,000,000,000 using scientific notation. Solution: Here we count twelve decimal places to the left of the decimal point to obtain the number 1.075. Answer: 1.075 × 10 12   Example 12: Write 0.000003045 using scientific notation. Solution: Here we count six decimal places to the right to obtain 3.045. Answer: 3.045 × 10 − 6   Often we will need to perform operations when using numbers in scientific notation. All the rules of exponents developed so far also apply to numbers in scientific notation.   Example 13: Multiply: ( 4.36 × 10 − 5 ) ( 5.3 × 10 12 ) . Solution: Use the fact that multiplication is commutative and apply the product rule for exponents. Answer: 2.3108 × 10 8   Example 14: Divide: ( 3.24 × 10 8 ) ÷ ( 9.0 × 10 − 3 ) . Solution: Answer: 3.6 × 10 10   Example 15: The speed of light is approximately 6.7 × 10 8 miles per hour. Express this speed in miles per second. Solution: A unit analysis indicates that we must divide the number by 3,600. Answer: The speed of light is approximately 1.9 × 10 5 miles per second.   Example 16: By what factor is the radius of the sun larger than the radius of earth? Solution: We want to find the number that when multiplied times the radius of earth equals the radius of the sun. Source: NASA and European Space Agency, from http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=188. Therefore, Answer: The radius of the sun is approximately 110 times that of earth.   Try this! Divide: ( 6.75 × 10 − 8 ) ÷ ( 9 × 10 − 17 ) .
