Some Applications Recall that the area of a rectangle having length L and width W is found using the formula A = LW . The area of a square having side s is found using the formula A = s2 (see Figure 5.31). L W A = LW s sA = s2 Figure 5.31: Area formulae for the rectangle and square. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Find the area of the square in Figure 5.32 by summing theFind the area of the square shown below by summing the area of its parts. x 4 x 4 area of its parts. Solution: Let’s separate each of the four pieces and label each with its area (see Figure 5.33). x 3 x 3 Figure 5.32: Find the sum of the parts. x x A1 = x2 3 x A2 = 3x 3 xA4 = 3x 3 3 A3 = 9 Figure 5.33: Finding the area of each of the four parts. The two shaded squares in Figure 5.33 have areas A1 = x2 and A3 = 9, respec- tively. The two unshaded rectangles in Figure 5.33 have areas A2 = 3x and A4 = 3x. Summing these four areas gives us the area of the entire figure. A = A1 +A2 +A3 +A4 = x2 + 3x+ 9 + 3x = x2 + 6x+ 9 Answer: x2 + 8x+ 16 ! 5.4. ADDING AND SUBTRACTING POLYNOMIALS 339 You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Ginger runs a business selling wicker baskets. Her business The costs for producing and selling x widgets are given by the polynomial function C(x) = 50 + 5x− 0.5x2, and the revenue for selling x widgets is given by the polynomial function R(x) = 3.5x. Determine the profit if 75 widgets are sold. costs for producing and selling x wicker baskets are given by the polynomial function C(x) = 100+3x−0.02x2. The revenue she earns from selling x wicker baskets is given by the polynomial function R(x) = 2.75x. Find a formula for P (x), the profit made from selling x wicker baskets. Use your formula to determine Ginger’s profit if she sells 123 wicker baskets. Solution: The profit made from selling x wicker baskets is found by subtract- ing the costs incurred from the revenue received. In symbols: P (x) = R(x)− C(x) Next, replace R(x) and C(x) with their definitions. Because we are supposed to subtract all of the cost from the revenue, be sure to surround the cost polynomial with parentheses. P (x) = 2.75x− (100 + 3x− 0.02x2) Distribute the minus sign and combine like terms. = 2.75x− 100− 3x+ 0.02x2 = 0.02x2 − 0.25x− 100 Thus, the profit function is P (x) = 0.02x2 − 0.25x− 100. Next, to determine the profit if 123 wicker baskets are sold, substitute 123 for x in the profit function P (x). P (x) = 0.02x2 − 0.25x− 100 P (123) = 0.02(123)2 − 0.25(123)− 100 You can now use your graphing calculator to determine the profit (see Figure 5.34). Hence, the profit made from selling 123 wicker baskets is $171.83. Figure 5.34: Determining the profit from selling 123 wicker baskets. Answer: $2,650 ! 340 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS ! ! !
