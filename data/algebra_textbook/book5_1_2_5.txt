Evaluating Fractions If a fraction bar is present, evaluate the numerator and denominator separately according to the Rules Guiding Order of Operations, then perform the division in the final step. 1.2. ORDER OF OPERATIONS 23 You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Evaluate the expression If a = −7, b = −3, c = −15, and d = −14, evaluate: a2 + b2 c+ d ad− bc a+ b at a = 5, b = −3, c = 2, and d = −4. Solution. Following Tips for Evaluating Algebraic Expressions, first replace all occurrences of variables in the expression (ad− bc)/(a+ b) with open paren- theses. Next, substitute the given values of variables (5 for a, −3 for b, 2 for c, and −4 for d) in the open parentheses. ad− bc a+ b = ( )( )− ( )( ) ( ) + ( ) = (5)(−4)− (−3)(2) (5) + (−3) Finally, follow the Rules Guiding Order of Operations to evaluate the result- ing expression. Note that we evaluate the expressions in the numerator and denominator separately, then divide. ad− bc a+ b = ( )( )− ( )( ) ( ) + ( ) Replace variables with parentheses. = (5)(−4)− (−3)(2) (5) + (−3) Substitute: 5 for a, −3 for b, 2 for c, −4 for d = −20− (−6) 2 Numerator: (5)(−4) = −20, (−3)(2) = −6 Denominator: 5 + (−3) = 2 = −20 + 6 2 Numerator: Add the opposite = −14 2 Numerator: −20 + 6 = −14 = −7 Divide. Thus, if a = 5, b = −3, c = 2, and d = −4, then (ad− bc)/(a+ b) = −7. Answer: −2 !
