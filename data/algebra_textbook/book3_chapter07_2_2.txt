Addition and Subtraction Same procedure as for rational numbers! ·        Only the numerators can be added together, and only when all the denominators are the same Finding the LCD The LCD is built up of all the factors of the individual denominators, each factor included the most number of times it appears in an individual denominator. The product of all the denominators is always a common denominator, but not necessarily the LCD (the final answer may have to be reduced).   Example:  Given equation: Factor both denominators: Assemble the LCD: Note that the LCD contains both denominators Build up the fractions so that they both have the LCD for a denominator: (keep both denominators in factored form to make it easier to see what factors they need to look like the LCD) Now that they are over the same denominator, you can add the numerators: And simplify: Addition and Subtraction Same procedure as for rational numbers! ·        Only the numerators can be added together, and only when all the denominators are the same Finding the LCD The LCD is built up of all the factors of the individual denominators, each factor included the most number of times it appears in an individual denominator.
