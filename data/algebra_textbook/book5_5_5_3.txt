Raising a Power to a Power Suppose we have an exponential expression raised to a second power, such as (x2)3. The second exponent tells us to write x2 as a factor three times: (x2)3 = x2 · x2 · x2 Write x2 as a factor three times. = x6 Repeat the base, add the exponents. Note how we added 2 + 2 + 2 to get 6. However, a much faster way to add “three twos” is to multiply: 3 · 2 = 6. Thus, when raising a “power to a second power,” repeat the base and multiply the exponents, as follows: (x2)3 = x2·3 = x6 The preceding discussion gives rise to the following third law of exponents. 348 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS Raising a Power to a Power. When raising a power to a power, repeat the base and multiply the exponents. In symbols: (am)n = amn Note that juxtaposing two variables, as in mn, means “m times n.” You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Simplify each of the following expressions:Simplify: (23)4 (a) (z3)5 (b) (73)0 (c) [(x− y)3]6 Solution: In each example we are raising a power to a power. Hence, in each case, we repeat the base and multiply the exponents. (a) (z3)5 = z3·5 = z15 (b) (73)0 = 73·0 = 70 = 1 (c) [(x− y)3]6 = (x − y)3·6 = (x − y)18 With a little practice, each of the examples can be simplified mentally. Repeat the base and multiply the exponents in your head: (z3)5 = z15, (73)4 = 712, and [(x− y)3]6 = (x − y)18.Answer: 212 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Simplify: (x2n−3)4Simplify: (a2−n)3 Solution: Again, we repeat the base and multiply the exponents. (x2n−3)4 = x4(2n−3) Repeat the base, multiply exponents. = x8n−12 Distribute the 4.
