Translating from Verbal to Mathematical Expressions To solve a problem using algebra, we must first express the problem algebraically. To express a problem algebraically, we must scrutinize the wording of the problem to determine the variables and constants that are present and the relationships among them. Then we must translate the verbal phrases and statements to algebraic expressions and equations. To help us translate verbal expressions to mathematics, we can use the following table as a mathematics dictionary. Table 5.1. Mathematics Dictionary Word or Phrase Mathematical Operation Sum, sum of, added to, increased by, more than, plus, and + Difference, minus, subtracted from, decreased by, less, less than − Product, the product of, of, muitiplied by, times ⋅ Quotient, divided by, ratio ÷ Equals, is equal to, is, the result is, becomes = A number, an unknown quantity, an unknown, a quantity x (or any symbol) Translating from Verbal to Mathematical Expressions To solve a problem using algebra, we must first express the problem algebraically.
