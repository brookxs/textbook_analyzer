The Meaning and Notation for Area The product (length unit)⋅(length unit) = (length unit)2 , or, square length unit (sq length unit), can be interpreted physically as the area of a surface. Area The area of a surface is the amount of square length units contained in the surface. For example, 3 sq in. means that 3 squares, 1 inch on each side, can be placed precisely on some surface. (The squares may have to be cut and rearranged so they match the shape of the surface.) We will examine the area of the following geometric figures.
