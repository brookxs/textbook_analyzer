Grouping Symbols The Rules Guiding Order of Operations require that expressions inside group- ing symbols (parentheses, brackets, or curly braces) be evaluated first. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Simplify: −2(3− 4)2 + 5(1− 2)3 Simplify: −2− 3(−2− 3)3 Solution. The Rules Guiding Order of Operations require that we first eval- uate the expressions contained inside the grouping symbols. −2(3− 4)2 + 5(1− 2)3 = −2(3 + (−4))2 + 5(1 + (−2))3 Add the opposites. = −2(−1)2 + 5(−1)3 Parentheses first: 3 + (−4) = −1 and 1 + (−2) = −1. Evaluate the exponents next, perform the multiplications, then add. = −2(1) + 5(−1) Exponents: (−1)2 = 1 and (−1)3 = −1. = −2 + (−5) Multiply: −2(1) = −2 and 5(−1) = −5. = −7 Add: −2 + (−5) = −7 Thus, −2(3− 4)2 + 5(1− 2)3 = −7.
