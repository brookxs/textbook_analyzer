Exponents In the exponential expression an, the number a is called the base, while the number n is called the exponent. We now define what is meant by an exponent. Exponents. Let a be an integer and let n be any whole number. If n != 0, then: an = a · a · a · · · · · a︸ ︷︷ ︸ n times That is, to calculate an, write a as a factor n times. You Try It! EXAMPLE 10. Simplify (−2)3.Simplify: (−2)2 Solution: In the exponential expression (−2)3, note that −2 is the base, while 3 is the exponent. The exponent tells us to write the base as a factor three times. Simplify the result by performing the multiplications in order, moving from left to right. (−2)3 = (−2)(−2)(−2) −2 as a factor, three times. = (4)(−2) Multiply: (−2)(−2) = 4. = −8 Multiply: (4)(−2) = −8. Thus, (−2)3 = −8.Answer: 4 ! In Example 10, note that the product of three negative factors is negative. Let’s try another example. 1.1. AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INTEGERS 11 You Try It! EXAMPLE 11. Simplify (−2)4. Simplify: (−2)5 Solution: In the exponential expression (−2)4, note that −2 is the base, while 4 is the exponent. The exponent tells us to write the base as a factor four times. Simplify the result by performing the multiplications in order, moving from left to right. (−2)4 = (−2)(−2)(−2)(−2) −2 as a factor, four times. = (4)(−2)(−2) Multiply: (−2)(−2) = 4. = (−8)(−2) Multiply: (4)(−2) = −8. = 16 Multiply: (−8)(−2) = 16. Thus, (−2)4 = 16. Answer: −32 ! In Example 11, note that the product of four negative factors is positive. Examples 10 and 11 reveal the following pattern. Odd or Even Exponents. 1. When a negative integer is raised to an even exponent, the result is positive. 2. When a negative integer is raised to an odd exponent, the result is neg- ative.
