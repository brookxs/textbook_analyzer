Denominate Numbers and Pure Numbers Denominate Numbers, Like and Unlike Denominate Numbers It is often necessary or convenient to compare two quantities. Denominate num­bers are numbers together with some specified unit. If the units being compared are alike, the denominate numbers are called like denominate numbers. If units are not alike, the numbers are called unlike denominate numbers. Examples of denominate numbers are shown in the diagram: Pure Numbers Numbers that exist purely as numbers and do not represent amounts of quantities are called pure numbers. Examples of pure numbers are 8, 254, 0, , , and 0.07. Numbers can be compared in two ways: subtraction and division. Comparing Numbers by Subtraction and Division Comparison of two numbers by subtraction indicates how much more one number is than another. Comparison by division indicates how many times larger or smaller one number is than another. Comparing Pure or Like Denominate Numbers by Subtraction Numbers can be compared by subtraction if and only if they both are like denominate numbers or both pure numbers. Sample Set A Example 7.1.  Compare 8 miles and 3 miles by subtraction. 8 mile – 3 miles = 5 miles This means that 8 miles is 5 miles more than 3 miles. Examples of use: I can now jog 8 miles whereas I used to jog only 3 miles. So, I can now jog 5 miles more than I used to. Example 7.2.  Compare 12 and 5 by subtraction. 12 − 5 = 7 This means that 12 is 7 more than 5. Example 7.3.  Comparing 8 miles and 5 gallons by subtraction makes no sense. 8 miles – 5 gallons = ? Example 7.4.  Compare 36 and 4 by division. 36 ÷ 4 = 9 This means that 36 is 9 times as large as 4. Recall that 36÷4 = 9 can be expressed as . Example 7.5.  Compare 8 miles and 2 miles by division. This means that 8 miles is 4 times as large as 2 miles. Example of use: I can jog 8 miles to your 2 miles. Or, for every 2 miles that you jog, I jog 8. So, I jog 4 times as many miles as you jog. Notice that when like quantities are being compared by division, we drop the units. Another way of looking at this is that the units divide out (cancel). Example 7.6.  Compare 30 miles and 2 gallons by division. Example of use: A particular car goes 30 miles on 2 gallons of gasoline. This is the same as getting 15 miles to 1 gallon of gasoline. Notice that when the quantities being compared by division are unlike quantities, we do not drop the units. Practice Set A Make the following comparisons and interpret each one. Exercise 7.2.1.
