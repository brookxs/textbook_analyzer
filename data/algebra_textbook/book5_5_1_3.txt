Mapping Diagram Notation The goal of this section is to introduce function notation. Let’s begin with the mapping diagram in Figure 5.8. f 1 2 2 4 3 6 4 8 Figure 5.8: Mapping diagram . The mapping diagram in Figure 5.8 reveals the following facts: • f maps 1 to 2 or f : 1→ 2. • f maps 2 to 4 or f : 2→ 4. 300 CHAPTER 5. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS • f maps 3 to 6 or f : 3→ 6. • f maps 4 to 8 or f : 4→ 8. Note how the notation f : 4 → 8 correlates nicely with the mapping diagram in Figure 5.8. The notation f : 4 → 8 is read “f maps 4 to 8” or “f sends 4 to 8.” A closer look at the mapping diagram in Figure 5.8 reveals an interesting pattern. The “rule” seems to be that the relation f doubles each entry in its domain: twice 1 is 2, twice 2 is 4, twice 3 is 6, etc. It’s possible to give a general description of this “rule” by writing: f : x→ 2x (5.1) That is, f sends x to twice x, or equivalently, 2x. For example, we might ask “where does f send 15?” To answer this question, we would replace x with 15 in the rule (5.1) to get f : 15→ 2(15), or equivalently, f : 15→ 30. We could also ask “where does f send −7?” To answer this question, we would replace x with −7 in the rule (5.1) to get f : −7→ 2(−7), or equivalently, f : −7 → −14. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Given the rule f : x → 2x + 3, answer the question “whereGiven the rule f : x→ 3x− 5, answer the question “where does f send −2?” does f send 8?” Solution: To find where “f sends 8,” substitute 8 for x in the rule f : x → 2x+ 3 to get f : 8 → 2(8) + 3, or equivalently, f : 8 → 19. Answer: f : −2 → −11 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Given the rule f : x→ x/(x+3), answer the question “whereGiven the rule f : x→ 2x2 + 5x, answer the question “where does f send 3?” does f send −1?” 5.1. FUNCTIONS 301 Solution: To find where “f sends −1,” substitute −1 for x in the rule f : x→ x/(x+ 3) to get f : −1→ −1−1 + 3 or equivalently, f : −1→ −1 2 . Answer: f : 3 → 33 ! In Examples 7 and 8, note that each time you substitute a value for x in the given rule, you get a unique answer. This means that each object in the domain of f is sent to a unique object in the range of f , making the rules in Examples 7 and 8 functions. This leads us to an itemized description of a function. Rule of Three. A function consists of three parts: • a set of objects which mathematicians call the domain, • a second set of objects which mathematicians call the range, • and a rule that describes how to assign each object in the domain to exactly one object in the range.
