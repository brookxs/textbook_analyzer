The Difference of Squares The second special product form we learned in Chapter 5 was the difference of squares. The difference of squares. Here is the difference of squares rule. (a+ b)(a− b) = a2 − b2 If you are multiplying two binomials which have the exact same terms in the “First” positions and the exact same terms in the “Last” positions, but one set is separated by a plus sign while the other set is separated by a minus sign, then multiply as follows: 1. Square the first term: a2 2. Square the second term: b2 3. Place a minus sign between the two squares. 6.5. FACTORING SPECIAL FORMS 445 You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Expand each of the following: Expand: (4x− 3y)(4x+ 3y) a) (3x+ 5)(3x− 5) b) (a3 − 2b3)(a3 + 2b3) Solution: We apply the difference of squares pattern to expand each of the given problems. a) In (3x + 5)(3x − 5), we have the exact same terms in the “First” and “Last” positions, with the first set separated by a plus sign and the second set separated by a minus sign. a) Square the first term: (3x)2 = 9x2 b) Square the second term: 52 = 25 c) Place a minus sign between the two squares. Hence: (3x+ 5)(3x− 5) = 9x2 − 25 b) In (a3 − 2b3)(a3 + 2b3), we have the exact same terms in the “First” and “Last” positions, with the first set separated by a minus sign and the second set separated by a plus sign. a) Square the first term: (a3)2 = a6 b) Square the second term: (2b3)2 = 4b6 c) Place a minus sign between the two squares. Hence: (a3 − 2b3)(a3 + 2b3) = a6 − 4b6 Answer: 16x2 − 9y2 ! Because factoring is “unmultiplying,” is should be a simple matter to reverse the process of Example 7. You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Factor each of the following: Factor: 81x2 − 49 a) 9x2 − 25 b) a6 − 4b6 Solution: Because of the work already done in Example 7, it is a simple matter to factor (or “unmultiply”) each of these problems. a) 9x2 − 25 = (3x+ 5)(3x− 5) b) a6 − 4b6 = (a3 − 2b3)(a3 + 2b3) 446 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING In each case, note how we took the square roots of each term, then separated one set with a plus sign and the other with a minus sign. Because of the commutative property of multiplication, it does not matter which one you make plus and which one you make minus.Answer: (9x+ 7)(9x− 7) ! Always remember the first rule of factoring. The first rule of factoring. The first step to perform in any factoring problem is factor out the GCF. You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Factor: x3 − 9xFactor: 4x4 − 16x2 Solution: In x3 − 9x, the GCF of x3 and 9x is x. Factor out x. x3 − 9x = x(x2 − 9) Note that x2 − 9 is now the difference of two perfect squares. Take the square roots of x2 and 9, which are x and 3, then separate one set with a plus sign and the other set with a minus sign. = x(x + 3)(x− 3) Answer: 4x2(x+ 2)(x− 2) !
