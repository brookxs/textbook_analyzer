Addition Suppose we have two collections of objects that we combine together to form a third collection. For example, We are combining a collection of four objects with a collection of three objects to obtain a collection of seven objects. Addition The process of combining two or more objects (real or intuitive) to form a third, the total, is called addition. In addition, the numbers being added are called addends or terms, and the total is called the sum. The plus symbol (+) is used to indicate addition, and the equal symbol (=) is used to represent the word "equal." For example, 4 + 3 = 7 means "four added to three equals seven."
