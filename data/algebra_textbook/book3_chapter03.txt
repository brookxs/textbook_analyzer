 ||  || Plan 1.      First focus on the objective. What do you need to know in order to answer the question? 2.      Then look at the given information. How can you use that information to get what you need to know to answer the question? 3.      If you do not see a clear logical path leading from the given information to the solution, just try something. Look at the given information and think about what you can find from it, even if it is not what the question is asking for. Often you will find another piece of information that you can then use to answer the question.  || Write equations You need to express mathematically the logical connections between the given information and the answer you are seeking. This involves: 1.      Assigning variable names to the unknown quantities. The letter x is always popular, but it is a good idea to use something that reminds you what it represents, such as d for distance or t for time. The trickiest part of assigning variables is that you want to use a minimum number of different variables (just one if possible). If you know how two quantities are related, then you can express them both with just one variable. For example, if Jim is two years older than John is, you might let x stand for John’s age and (x + 2) stand for Jim’s age. 2.      Translate English into Math. Mathematics is a language, one that is particularly well suited to describing logical relationships. English, on the other hand, is much less precise. The next page is a table of English phrases and their corresponding mathematical meanings, but don’t take it too literally. The meaning of English words has to be taken in context.  || Solve Now you just have to solve the equation(s) for the unknown(s). Remember to answer the question that the problem asks.  || Check Think about your answer. Does your answer come out in the correct units? Is it reasonable? If you made a mistake somewhere, chances are your answer will not just be a little bit off, but will be completely ridiculous  || Note: The English language is notoriously imprecise, and these suggested translations should be taken only as a guide, not as absolutes.Subtraction minus “a number minus 2” x – 2 difference between “the difference between a number and 8” x – 8 from “2 from a number” n – 2 less “a number less 3” n – 3 less than “3 less than a number” y – 3 fewer than “2 fewer than a number” y – 2 decreased by “a number decreased by 2” x – 2 take away “a number take away 2” x – 2 Addition plus “a number plus 2” x + 2 and “3 and a number” 3 + n added to “8 added to a number” x + 8 greater than “3 greater than a number” n + 3 more than “3 more than a number” y + 3 increased by “a number increased by 2” y + 2 total “the total length” l1 + l2 sum of “The sum of length and width” l + w Multiplication times “5 times a number” 5n product “The product of 3 and a number” 3y at “3 at 1.59” 3 ´ 1.59 double, triple, etc. “double a number” 2x twice “twice a number” 2y of (fractions of) “three-fourths of a number” Division quotient of “The quotient of 5 and a number” Half of “half of a number” goes into “a numbergoes into 6 twice” per “The price is $8 per 50”   Equals Is, is the same as, gives, will be, was, is equivalent to   ||  || Number/Geometry Problems Example:  Find a number such that 5 more than one-half the number is three times the number. Let x be the unknown number.   Translating into math: 5 + x/2 = 3x Solving: (First multiply by 2 to clear the fraction) 5 + x/2 = 3x 10 + x = 6x 10 = 5x x = 2 Example:  If the perimeter of a rectangle is 10 inches, and one side is one inch longer than the other, how long are the sides? Let one side be x and the other side be x + 1. Then the given condition may be expressed as x + x + (x + 1) + (x + 1) = 10 Solving: 4x + 2 = 10 4x = 8 x = 2 so the sides have length 2 and 3.  || Rate-Time Problems ·        Rate = Quantity/Time or ·        Quantity = Rate × Time Example:  A fast employee can assemble 7 radios in an hour, and another slower employee can only assemble 5 radios per hour. If both employees work together, how long will it take to assemble 26 radios? The two together will build 7 + 5 = 12 radios in an hour, so their combined rate is 12 radios/hr. Using Time = Quantity/Rate, Time = 26/12 = 2 1/6 h or 2 hours 10 minutes Example:  you are driving along at 55 mph when you are passed by a car doing 85 mph. How long will it take for the car that passed you to be one mile ahead of you? We know the two rates, and we know that the difference between the two distances traveled will be one mile, but we don’t know the actual distances. Let D be the distance that you travel in time t, and D + 1 be the distance that the other car traveled in time t. Using the rate equation in the form distance = speed • time for each car we can write D = 55 t, and D + 1 = 85 t Substituting the first equation into the second, 55t + 1 = 85t -30t = -1 t = 1/30 hr(or 2 minutes)  || Mixture Problems Example:  How much of a 10% vinegar solution should be added to 2 cups of a 30% vinegar solution to make a 20% solution? Let x be the unknown amount of 10% solution. Write an equation for the amount of vinegar in each mixture: (amount of vinegar in first solution) + (amount of vinegar in second solution) = (amount of vinegar in total solution) 0.1x + 0.3(2) = 0.2(x + 2) 0.1x + 0.6 = 0.2x + 0.4 -0.1x = -0.2 x = 2 cups  ||
