3.5 Point-Slope Form of a Line In the previous section we learned that if we are provided with the slope of a line and its y-intercept, then the equation of the line is y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-coordinate of the line’s y-intercept. However, suppose that the y-intercept is unknown? Instead, suppose that we are given a point (x0, y0) on the line and we’re also told that the slope of the line is m (see Figure 3.71). x y (x0, y0) (x, y) Slope = m Figure 3.71: A line through the point (x0, y0) with slope m. Let (x, y) be an arbitrary point on the line, then use the points (x0, y0) and (x, y) to calculate the slope of the line. Slope = ∆y ∆x The slope formula. m = y − y0 x− x0 Substitute m for the slope. Use (x, y)and (x0, y0) to calculate the difference in y and the difference in x. Clear the fractions from the equation by multiplying both sides by the common denominator. m(x− x0) = [ y − y0 x− x0 ] (x− x0) Multiply both sides by x− x0. m(x− x0) = y − y0 Cancel. Thus, the equation of the line is y − y0 = m(x− x0). 214 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING The Point-Slope form of a line.

Solution: Plot the point (−3,−1), then move 3 units up and 5 units to the right (see Figure 3.72). To find the equation, substitute (−3,−1) for (x0, y0) and 3/5 for m in the point-slope form of the line. y − y0 = m(x− x0) Point-slope form. y − (−1) = 3 5 (x− (−3)) Substitute: 3/5 for m, −3 for x0, and −1 for y0.

Find the equation of the line passing through the points Find the equation of the line passing through the points P (−2, 1) and Q(4,−1). P (−1, 2) and Q(3,−4). Solution: First, plot the points P (−1, 2) andQ(3,−4) and draw a line through them (see Figure 3.73). −5 5 −5 5 x y P (−1, 2) Q(3,−4) Figure 3.73: The line passing through P (−1, 2) and Q(3,−4). Next, let’s calculate the slope of the line by subtracting the coordinates of the point P (−1, 2) from the coordinates of point Q(3,−4). Slope = ∆y ∆x = −4− 2 3− (−1) = −6 4 = −3 2 Thus, the slope is −3/2. Next, use the point-slope form y−y0 = m(x−x0) to determine the equation of the line. It’s clear that we should substitute −3/2 for m. But which of the two points should we use? If we use the point P (−1, 2) for (x0, y0), we get the answer on the left, but if we use the point Q(3,−4) for (x0, y0), we get the 216 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING answer on the right. y − 2 = −3 2 (x− (−1)) or y − (−4) = −3 2 (x− 3) At first glance, these answers do not look the same, but let’s examine them a bit more closely, solving for y to put each in slope-intercept form. Let’s start with the equation on the left. y − 2 = −3 2 (x− (−1)) Using m = −3/2 and (x0, y0) = (−1, 2). y − 2 = −3 2 (x+ 1) Simplify. y − 2 = −3 2 x− 3 2 Distribute −3/2. y − 2 + 2 = −3 2 x− 3 2 + 2 Add 2 to both sides. y = −3 2 x− 3 2 + 4 2 On the left, simplify. On the right, make equivalent fractions with a common denominator. y = −3 2 x+ 1 2 Simplify. Let’s put the second equation in slope-intercept form.Note that the form y = − 32x+ 12 , when compared with the general slope-intercept form y = mx+ b, indicates that the y-intercept is (0, 1/2). Examine Figure 3.73. Does it appear that the y-intercept is (0, 1/2)? y − (−4) = −3 2 (x− 3) Using m = −3/2 and (x0, y0) = (3,−4). y + 4 = −3 2 (x− 3) Simplify. y + 4 = −3 2 x+ 9 2 Distribute −3/2. y + 4− 4 = −3 2 x+ 9 2 − 4 Subtract 4 from both sides. y = −3 2 x+ 9 2 − 8 2 On the left, simplify. On the right, make equivalent fractions with a common denominator. y = −3 2 x+ 1 2 Simplify. Thus, both equations simplify to the same answer, y = − 32x+ 12 . This means that the equations y − 2 = − 32 (x − (−1)) and y − (−4) = − 32 (x − 3), though they look different, are the same.Answer: y = −1 3 x+ 1 3 ! 3.5.

Let (x, y) be an arbitrary point on the line, then use the points (x0, y0) and (x, y) to calculate the slope of the line. Slope = ∆y ∆x The slope formula. m = y − y0 x− x0 Substitute m for the slope. Use (x, y)and (x0, y0) to calculate the difference in y and the difference in x. Clear the fractions from the equation by multiplying both sides by the common denominator. m(x− x0) = [ y − y0 x− x0 ] (x− x0) Multiply both sides by x− x0. m(x− x0) = y − y0 Cancel.

POINT-SLOPE FORM OF A LINE 217 Example 2 gives rise to the following tip. Tip. When finding the equation of a line through two points P and Q, you may substitute either point P or Q for (x0, y0) in the point-slope form y−y0 = m(x− x0). The results look different, but they are both equations of the same line.  || Parallel Lines Recall that slope is a number that measures the steepness of the line. If two lines are parallel (never intersect), they have the same steepness. Parallel lines. If two lines are parallel, they have the same slope. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3.

Find the equation of this parallel line. Solution: Note that y = 34x− 2 is in slope-intercept form y = mx+ b. Hence, its slope is 3/4 and its y-intercept is (0,−2). Plot the y-intercept (0,−2), move up 3 units, right 4 units, then draw the line (see Figure 3.74). −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 3 ∆x = 4 (0,−2) Figure 3.74: The line y = 34x− 2. −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 3 ∆x = 4 (−1, 1) Figure 3.75: Adding a line parallel to y = 34x− 2. The second line must be parallel to the first, so it must have the same slope 3/4. Plot the point (−1, 1), move up 3 units, right 4 units, then draw the line (see the red line in Figure 3.75). 218 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING To find the equation of the parallel red line in Figure 3.75, use the point- slope form, substitute 3/4 for m, then (−1, 1) for (x0, y0).

Check: In this example, we were not required to solve for y, so we can save ourselves some checking work by writing the equation y − 1 = 3 4 (x+ 1) in the form y = 3 4 (x+ 1) + 1 by adding 1 to both sides of the first equation.

POINT-SLOPE FORM OF A LINE 219  || Perpendicular Lines Two lines are perpendicular if they meet and form a right angle (90 degrees). For example, the lines L1 and L2 in Figure 3.80 are perpendicular, but the lines L1 and L2 in Figure 3.81 are not perpendicular. x y L1 L2 Figure 3.80: The lines L1 and L2 are perpendicular. They meet and form a right angle (90 degrees). x y L1 L2 Figure 3.81: The lines L1 and L2 are not perpendicular. They do not form a right angle (90 degrees). Before continuing, we need to establish a relation between the slopes of two perpendicular lines. So, consider the perpendicular lines L1 and L2 in Figure 3.82. x y L1 L2 1 m11 −m1 Figure 3.82: Perpendicular lines L1 and L2. Things to note: 1. If we were to rotate line L1 ninety degrees counter-clockwise, then L1 would align with the line L2, as would the right triangles revealing their slopes. 2. L1 has slope ∆y ∆x = m1 1 = m1. 220 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHING 3. L2 has slope ∆y ∆x = 1 −m1 = − 1 m1 . Slopes of perpendicular lines. If L1 and L2 are perpendicular lines and L1 has slope m1, the L2 has slope −1/m1. That is, the slope of L2 is the negative reciprocal of the slope of L1. Examples: To find the slope of a perpendicular line, invert the slope of the first line and negate. • If the slope of L1 is 2, then the slope of the perpendicular line L2 is −1/2. • If the slope of L1 is −3/4, then the slope of the perpendicular line L2 is 4/3. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Sketch the line y = − 23x − 3, then sketch the line throughFind the equation of the line that passes through the point (−3, 1) and is perpendicular to the line y = − 12x+ 1. (2, 1) that is perpendicular to the line y = − 23x− 3. Find the equation of this perpendicular line. Solution: Note that y = − 23x−3 is in slope-intercept form y = mx+b. Hence, its slope is −2/3 and its y-intercept is (0,−3). Plot the y-intercept (0,−3), move right 3 units, down two units, then draw the line (see Figure 3.83). −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆x = 3 ∆y = −2(0,−3) Figure 3.83: The line y = − 23x− 3. −5 5 −5 5 x y ∆y = 3 ∆x = 2 (2, 1) Figure 3.84: Adding a line perpen- dicular to y = − 23x− 3. Because the line y = − 23x−3 has slope −2/3, the slope of the line perpendicular to this line will be the negative reciprocal of −2/3, namely 3/2. Thus, to draw the perpendicular line, start at the given point (2, 1), move up 3 units, right 2 units, then draw the line (see Figure 3.84). 3.5.

That is, substitute 2 for x0, then 1 for y0. y − y0 = m(x− x0) Point-slope form. y − 1 = 3 2 (x− 2) Substitute: 3/2 for m, 2 for x0, and 1 for y0. Check: In this example, we were not required to solve for y, so we can save ourselves some checking work by writing the equation y − 1 = 3 2 (x − 2) in the form y = 3 2 (x− 2) + 1 by adding 1 to both sides of the first equation.

The fact that the calculator’s viewing screen is wider than it is tall is distorting the angle at which the lines meet.
