 || The Logic Behind the Method Consider the sum of 4.37 and 3.22. Changing each decimal to a fraction, we have Performing the addition, we get Thus, 4.37 + 3.22 = 7.59.  || The Method of Adding and Subtracting Decimals When writing the previous addition, we could have written the numbers in col­umns. This agrees with our previous result. From this observation, we can suggest a method for adding and subtracting decimal numbers. Method of Adding and Subtracting Decimals To add or subtract decimals: Align the numbers vertically so that the decimal points line up under each other and the corresponding decimal positions are in the same column. Add or subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Place a decimal point in the resulting sum or difference directly under the other decimal points. Sample Set A Find the following sums and differences. Example 6.22.  9.813 + 2.140 Example 6.23.  841.0056 + 47.016 + 19.058 To insure that the columns align properly, we can write a 0 in the position at the end of the numbers 47.016 and 19.058 without changing their values. Example 6.24.  1.314 – 0.58 Example 6.25.  16.01 – 7.053 Example 6.26.  Find the sum of 6.88106 and 3.5219 and round it to three decimal places. We need to round the sum to the thousandths position. Since the digit in the position immediately to the right is 9, and 9>5, we get 10.403 Example 6.27.  Wendy has $643.12 in her checking account. She writes a check for $16.92. How much is her new account balance? To find the new account balance, we need to find the difference between 643.12 and 16.92. We will subtract 16.92 from 643.12. After writing a check for $16.92, Wendy now has a balance of $626.20 in her checking account. Practice Set A Find the following sums and differences. Exercise 6.5.1.

(Go to Solution) 16,521.07 + 9,256.15 Exercise 6.5.6. (Go to Solution) Find the sum of 11.6128 and 14.07353, and round it to two decimal places.  || Calculators The calculator can be useful for finding sums and differences of decimal numbers. However, calculators with an eight-digit display cannot be used when working with decimal numbers that contain more than eight digits, or when the sum results in more than eight digits. In practice, an eight-place decimal will seldom be encoun­tered. There are some inexpensive calculators that can handle 13 decimal places. Sample Set B Use a calculator to find each sum or difference. Example 6.28.  42.0638 + 126.551 Table 6.16.     Display Reads Type 42.0638 42.0638 Press + 42.0638 Type 126.551 126.551 Press = 168.6148 The sum is 168.6148. Example 6.29.  Find the difference between 305.0627 and 14.29667. Table 6.17.     Display Reads Type 305.0627 305.0627 Press — 305.0627 Type 14.29667 14.29667 Press = 290.76603 The difference is 290.76603 Example 6.30.  51.07 + 3,891.001786 Since 3,891.001786 contains more than eight digits, we will be unable to use an eight-digit display calculator to perform this addition. We can, however, find the sum by hand. The sum is 3,942.071786. Practice Set B Use a calculator to perform each operation. Exercise 6.5.7. (Go to Solution) 4.286 + 8.97 Exercise 6.5.8. (Go to Solution) 452.0092 – 392.558 Exercise 6.5.9. (Go to Solution) Find the sum of 0.095 and 0.001862 Exercise 6.5.10. (Go to Solution) Find the difference between 0.5 and 0.025 Exercise 6.5.11. (Go to Solution) Find the sum of 2,776.00019 and 2,009.00012.  ||
