Factors From observations made in the process of multiplication, we have seen that ( factor ) ⋅ ( factor ) = product Factors, Product The two numbers being multiplied are the factors and the result of the multiplication is the product. Now, using our knowledge of division, we can see that a first number is a factor of a second number if the first number divides into the second number a whole number of times (without a remainder). One Number as a Factor of Another A first number is a factor of a second number if the first number divides into the second number a whole number of times (without a remainder). We show this in the following examples: Example 3.23.  3 is a factor of 27, since 27÷3 = 9, or 3⋅9 = 27. Example 3.24.  7 is a factor of 56, since 56÷7 = 8, or 7⋅8 = 56. Example 3.25.  4 is not a factor of 10, since 10÷4 = 2R2. (There is a remainder.)
