 || The Division Property of Square Roots In our work with simplifying square root expressions, we noted that Since this is an equation, we may write it as To divide two square root expressions, we use the division property of square roots. The Division Property The quotient of the square roots is the square root of the quotient.  || Rationalizing the Denominator As we can see by observing the right side of the equation governing the division of square roots, the process may produce a fraction in the radicand. This means, of course, that the square root expression is not in simplified form. It is sometimes more useful to rationalize the denominator of a square root expression before actually performing the division.  || Conjugates and Rationalizing the Denominator To perform a division that contains a binomial in the denominator, such as we multiply the numerator and denominator by a conjugate of the denominator. Conjugate A conjugate of the binomial a + b is a – b . Similarly, a conjugate of a – b is a + b . Notice that when the conjugates a + b and a – b are multiplied together, they produce a difference of two squares. ( a + b )( a – b ) = a 2 – a b + a b – b 2 = a 2 – b 2 This principle helps us eliminate square root radicals, as shown in these examples that illustrate finding the product of conjugates.
