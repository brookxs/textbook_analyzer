 || 2. Dependent Equations ·        Equations describe the same line ·        Infinite number of solutions Sometimes two equations might look different but actually describe the same line. For example, in The second equation is just two times the first equation, so they are actually equivalent and would both be equations of the same line. Because the two equations describe the same line, they have all their points in common; hence there are an infinite number of solutions to the system. Attempting to solve gives an identity If you try to solve a dependent system by algebraic methods, you will eventually run into an equation that is an identity. An identity is an equation that is always true, independent of the value(s) of any variable(s). For example, you might get an equation that looks like x = x, or 3 = 3. This would tell you that the system is a dependent system, and you could stop right there because you will never find a unique solution.  || 3. Inconsistent Equations Lines do not intersect (Parallel Lines; have the same slope) No solutions If two lines happen to have the same slope, but are not identically the same line, then they will never intersect. There is no pair (x, y) that could satisfy both equations, because there is no point (x, y) that is simultaneously on both lines. Thus these equations are said to be inconsistent, and there is no solution. The fact that they both have the same slope may not be obvious from the equations, because they are not written in one of the standard forms for straight lines. The slope is not readily evident in the form we use for writing systems of equations. (If you think about it you will see that the slope is the negative of the coefficient of x divided by the coefficient of y). Attempting to solve gives a false statement By attempting to solve such a system of equations algebraically, you are operating on a false assumption—namely that a solution exists. This will eventually lead you to a contradiction: a statement that is obviously false, regardless of the value(s) of the variable(s). At some point in your work you would get an obviously false equation like 3 = 4. This would tell you that the system of equations is inconsistent, and there is no solution.     Solution by Graphing For more complex systems, and especially those that contain non-linear equations, finding a solution by algebraic methods can be very difficult or even impossible. Using a graphing calculator (or a computer), you can graph the equations and actually see where they intersect. The calculator can then give you the coordinates of the intersection point. The only drawback to this method is that the solution is only an approximation, whereas the algebraic method gives the exact solution. In most practical situations, though, the precision of the calculator is sufficient. For more demanding scientific and engineering applications there are computer methods that can find approximate solutions to very high precision.    ||
