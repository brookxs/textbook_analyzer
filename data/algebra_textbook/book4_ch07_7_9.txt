Finding the Base Sample Set C Example 7.47.  Thus, 15 is 30% of 50. Try Exercise 7.7.8. in the section called “Practice Set C”. Example 7.48.  Thus, 56.43 is 33% of 171. Try Exercise 7.7.8. in the section called “Practice Set C”. Example 7.49.  Fifteen milliliters of water represents 2% of a hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution. How many milliliters of solution are there? We need to determine the total supply. The word supply indicates base. Thus, there are 750 milliliters of solution in the bottle. Try Exercise 7.7.9. in the section called “Practice Set C”. Example 7.50.  In a particular city, a sales tax of % is charged on items purchased in local stores. If the tax on an item is $2.99, what is the price of the item? We need to determine the price of the item. We can think of price as the starting place. Starting place indicates base. We need to determine the base. Thus, the price of the item is $46.00. Try Exercise 7.7.10. in the section called “Practice Set C”. Example 7.51.  A clothing item is priced at $20.40. This marked price includes a 15% discount. What is the original price? We need to determine the original price. We can think of the original price as the starting place. Starting place indicates base. We need to determine the base. The new price, $20.40, represents 100% – 15% = 85% of the original price. Thus, the original price of the item is $24.00. Try Exercise 7.7.11. in the section called “Practice Set C”. Practice Set C Exercise 7.7.8. (Go to Solution) 1.98 is 2% of what number? Exercise 7.7.9. (Go to Solution) 3.3 milliliters of HCl represents 25% of an HCl solution. How many milliliters of solution are there? Exercise 7.7.10. (Go to Solution) A salesman, who makes a commission of % on each sale, makes a commission of $152.39 on a particular sale. Rounded to the nearest dollar, what is the amount of the sale? Exercise 7.7.11. (Go to Solution) At "super-long play," hours of play of a video cassette recorder represents 31.25% of the total playing time. What is the total playing time?
