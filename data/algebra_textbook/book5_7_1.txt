NEGATIVE EXPONENTS 479 You might be asking “Why does raising to the power of minus one invert the number?” To answer this question, recall the product of a number and its reciprocal is one. For example, 4 · 1 4 = 1. (7.1) Next, consider what happens when we multiply 41 and 4−1. If we apply the usual law of exponents (assuming they work for both positive and negative exponents), we would add the exponents (1 + (−1) = 0). 41 · 4−1 = 40 (7.2) However, because 41 = 4 and 40 = 1, this last equation is equivalent to: 4 · 4−1 = 1 (7.3) When you compare Equation 7.1 and 7.3, it is clear that 4−1 and 1/4 are both reciprocals of the number 4. Because reciprocals are unique, 4−1 = 1/4. In similar fashion, one can discover the meaning of a−n. Start with the fact that multiplying reciprocals yields an answer of one. an · 1 an = 1 (7.4) If we multiply an and a−n, we add the exponents as follows. an · a−n = a0 Providing a != 0, then a0 = 1, so we can write an · a−n = 1 (7.5) Comparing Equations 7.4 and 7.5, we note that both 1/an and a−n are recip- rocals of an.

RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS  || Raising to a Negative Integer We know what happens when you raise a number to −1, you invert the number or turn it upside down. But what happens when you raise a number to a negative integer other than negative one? As an example, consider the expression 3−2. Using the third law of expo- nents ((am)n = amn), we can write this expression in two equivalent forms. 1. Note that 3−2 is equivalent to (32)−1. They are equivalent because the third law of exponents instructs us to multiply the exponents when raising a power to another power. Finally, note that to evaluate (32)−1, we first square, then invert the result. 3−2 = (32)−1 Repeat base and multiply exponents. = 9−1 Simplify: 32 = 9. = 1 9 Simplify: 9−1 = 1/9. 2. Note that 3−2 is also equivalent to (3−1)2. They are equivalent because the third law of exponents instructs us to multiply the exponents when raising a power to another power. Finally, note that to evaluate (3−1)2, we first invert, then square the result. 3−2 = (3−1)2 Repeat base and multiply exponents. = ( 1 3 )2 Simplify: 3−1 = 1/3. = 1 9 Simplify: (1/3)2 = 1/9. Using either technique, 3−2 = 1/9. You can either square and invert, or you can invert and square. In each case, the 2 means “square” and the minus sign means “invert,” and this example shows that it doesn’t matter which you do first. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6.

NEGATIVE EXPONENTS 483 Note that the three means “cube” and the minus sign means “invert,” so it is possible to do all of this work mentally: cube 5 to get 125, then invert to get 1/125. b) We’ll square then invert. (−4)−2 = ((−4)2)−1 Repeat base, multiply exponents. = 16−1 Simplify: (−4)2 = 16. = 1 16 Invert: 16−1 = 1/16. Note that the two means “square” and the minus sign means “invert,” so it is possible to do all of this work mentally: square −4 to get 16, then invert to get 1/16. c) Again, we’ll square then invert.( 3 5 )−2 = (( 3 5 )2)−1 Repeat base, multiply exponents. = ( 9 25 )−1 Simplify: (3/5)2 = 9/25. = 25 9 Invert: (9/25)−1 = 25/9. Note that the two means “square” and the minus sign means “invert,” so it is possible to do all of this work mentally: square 3/5 to get 9/25, then invert to get 25/9. d) This time we’ll cube then invert.( −2 3 )−3 = (( −2 3 )3)−1 Repeat base, multiply exponents. = ( − 8 27 )−1 Simplify: (−2/3)3 = −8/27. = −27 8 Invert: (−8/27)−1 = −27/8. Note that the three means “cube” and the minus sign means “invert,” so it is possible to do all of this work mentally: cube −2/3 to get −8/27, then invert to get −27/8.

EXAMPLE 7. Simplify: (2x−2y3)(−3x5y−6)Simplify: (−5x8y−2)(−2x−6y−1) Solution: All the operators involved are multiplication, so the commutative and associative properties of multiplication allow us to change the order and grouping. We’ll show this regrouping here, but this step can be done mentally. (2x−2y3)(−3x5y−6) = [(2)(−3)](x−2x5)(y3y−6) When multiplying, we repeat the base and add the exponents. = −6x−2+5y3+(−6) = −6x3y−3 In the solution above, we’ve probably shown way too much work. It’s far easier to perform all of these steps mentally, multiplying the 2 and the −3, then repeating bases and adding exponents, as in: (2x−2y3)(−3x5y−6) = −6x3y−3 Answer: 10x2y−3 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 8. Simplify: 6x−2y5 9x3y−2Simplify: (10x3y−1) (4x−2y5) Solution: The simplest approach is to first write the expression as a product. 6x−2y5 9x3y−2 = 6 9 · x −2 x3 · y 5 y−2 Reduce 6/9 to lowest terms. Because we are dividing like bases, we repeat the base and subtract the exponents. = 2 3 x−2−3y5−(−2) = 2 3 x−2+(−3)y5+2 = 2 3 x−5y7 7.1. NEGATIVE EXPONENTS 485 In the solution above, we’ve probably shown way too much work. It’s far easier to imagine writing the expression as a product, reducing 6/9, then repeating bases and subtracting exponents, as in: 6x−2y5 9x3y−2 = 2 3 x−5y7 Answer: 5 2 x5y−6 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 9. Simplify: (2x−2y4)−3 Simplify: (3x4y−3)−2 Solution: The fourth law of exponents ((ab)n = anbn) says that when you raise a product to a power, you must raise each factor to that power. So we begin by raising each factor to the minus three power. (2x−2y3)−3 = 2−3(x−2)−3(y4)−3 To raise two to the minus three, we must cube two and invert: 2−3 = 1/8. Secondly, raising a power to a power requires that we repeat the base and multiply exponents. = 1 8 x(−2)(−3)y(4)(−3) = 1 8 x6y−12 In the solution above, we’ve probably shown way too much work. It’s far easier raise each factor to the minus three mentally: 2−3 = 1/8, then multiply each exponent on the remaining factors by −3, as in (2x−2y4)−3 = 1 8 x6y−12 Answer: 1 9 x−8y6 !  || Clearing Negative Exponents Often, we’re asked to provide a final answer that is free of negative exponents. It is common to hear the instruction “no negative exponents in the final an- swer.” Let’s explore a couple of techniques that allow us to clear our answer of negative exponents. 486 CHAPTER 7.

Solution: Raising y to the −3 means we have to cube and invert, so y−3 = 1/y3. x2 y−3 = x2 1 y3 To divide x2 by 1/y3, we invert and multiply. = x2 ÷ 1 y3 = x2 1 · y 3 1 = x2y3 Alternate approach: An alternate approach takes advantage of the laws of exponents. We begin by multiplying numerator and denominator by y3. x2 y−3 = x2 y−3 · y 3 y3 = x2y3 y0 = x2y3 In the last step, note how we used the fact that y0 = 1.Answer: y5x2 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 11.

In this case y−2 = 1/y2 (square and invert). 2x2y−2 z3 = 2x2 · 1 y2 z3 = 2x2 y2 z3 To divide 2x2/y2 by z3, we invert and multiply. = 2x2 y2 ÷ z3 = 2x2 y2 · 1 z3 = 2x2 y2z3 Alternate approach: An alternate approach again takes advantage of the laws of exponents. We begin by multiplying numerator and denominator by y2. 2x2y−2 z3 = 2x2y−2 z3 · y 2 y2 = 2x2y0 y2z3 = 2x2 y2z3 In the last step, note how we used the fact that y0 = 1.
