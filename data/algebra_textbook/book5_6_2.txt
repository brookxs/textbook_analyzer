6.2 Solving Nonlinear Equations We begin by introducing a property that will be used extensively in this and future sections. The zero product property. If the product of two or more numbers equals zero, then at least one of the numbers must equal zero. That is, if ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0. Let’s use the zero product property to solve a few equations. You Try It! EXAMPLE 1. Solve for x: (x + 3)(x− 5) = 0 Solve for x: (x − 7)(x− 2) = 0 Solution: The product of two factors equals zero. (x+ 3)(x− 5) = 0 Hence, at least one of the factors must equal zero. Using the zero product property, set each factor equal to zero, then solve the resulting equations for x. x+ 3 = 0 or x− 5 = 0 x = −3 x = 5 Hence, the solutions are x = −3 and x = 5 Check: Check that each solution satisfies the original equation. Substitute −3 for x: (x+ 3)(x− 5) = 0 (−3 + 3)(−3− 5) = 0 (0)(−8) = 0 0 = 0 Substitute 5 for x: (x+ 3)(x− 5) = 0 (5 + 3)(5− 5) = 0 (8)(0) = 0 0 = 0 Because each check produces a true statement, both x = −3 and x = 5 are solutions of (x+ 3)(x− 5) = 0. Answer: 7, 2 ! The zero product property also works equally well if more than two factors are present. For example, if abc = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0 or c = 0. Let’s use this idea in the next example. 400 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING You Try It! EXAMPLE 2.

We encourage the reader to check the solution.Answer: 0, −4, −1/5 !  || Linear versus Nonlinear All of the equations solved in previous chapters were examples of what are called linear equations. If the highest power of the variable we are solving for is one, then the graphs involved are lines. Hence the term, linear equation. However, if the power on the variable we are solving for exceeds one, then the graphs involved are curves. Hence the term, nonlinear equation. In this chapter we will learn how to solve nonlinear equations involving polynomials. However, let’s first make sure we can recognize the difference between a linear and a nonlinear equation. Linear versus Nonlinear. Use the following conditions to determine if an equation is linear or nonlinear. 1. If the highest power of the variable we are solving for is one, then the equation is linear. 2. If the highest power of the variable we are solving for is larger than one, then the equation is nonlinear. You Try It! EXAMPLE 3. If the instruction is “solve for x,” classify each of the followingClassify the following equation as linear or nonlinear: 2x = x3 − 4 equations as linear or nonlinear. 6.2. SOLVING NONLINEAR EQUATIONS 401 a) 3x− 5 = 4− 7x b) x2 = 8x Solution: Because the instruction is “solve for x,” to determine whether the equation is linear or nonlinear, we identify the largest power of x present in the equation. a) The highest power of x present in the equation 3x − 5 = 4 − 7x is one. Hence, this equation is linear. b) The equation x2 = 8x contains a power of x higher than one (it contains an x2). Hence, this equation is nonlinear. Answer: nonlinear ! Now that we can classify equations as either linear or nonlinear, let’s in- troduce strategies for solving each type, the first of which should already be familiar. Strategy for solving a linear equation. If an equation is linear, start the solution process by moving all terms containing the variable you are solving for to one side of the equation, then move all terms that do not contain the variable you are solving for to the other side of the equation. You Try It! EXAMPLE 4. Solve for x: 3x− 5 = 4− 7x Solve for x: 2x+ 4 = 6x+ 3 Solution: Because the instruction is “solve for x” and we note that the largest power of x present is one, the equation 3x − 5 = 4 − 7x is linear. Hence, the strategy is to move all terms containing x to one side of the equation, then move all the remaining terms to the other side of the equation. 3x− 5 = 4− 7x Original equation. 3x− 5 + 7x = 4 Add 7x to both sides. 3x+ 7x = 4 + 5 Add 5 to both sides. Note how we have succeeded in moving all terms containing x to one side of the equation and all terms that do not contain x to the other side of the equation. 10x = 9 Simplify both sides. x = 9 10 Divide both sides by 10. Hence, the solution of 3x− 5 = 4− 7x is x = 9/10. Readers are encouraged to check this solution. Answer: 1/4 ! 402 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING The situation is much different when the equation is nonlinear. Strategy for solving a nonlinear equation. If an equation is nonlinear, first move everything to one side of the equation, making one side of the equa- tion equal to zero. Continue the solution process by factoring and applying the zero product property. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Solve for x: x2 = 8xSolve for x: x2 = −5x Solution: Because the instruction is “solve for x,” and the highest power of x is larger than one, the equation x2 = 8x is nonlinear. Hence, the strategy requires that we move all terms to one side of the equation, making one side zero. x2 = 8x Original equation. x2 − 8x = 0 Subtract 8x from both sides. Note how we have succeeded in moving all terms to one side of the equation, making one side equal to zero. To finish the solution, we factor out the GCF on the left-hand side. x(x − 8) = 0 Factor out the GCF. Note that we now have a product of two factors that equals zero. By the zero product property, either the first factor is zero or the second factor is zero. x = 0 or x− 8 = 0 x = 8 Hence, the solutions are x = 0 and x = 8. Check: Check that each solution satisfies the original equation. Substitute 0 for x: x2 = 8x (0)2 = 8(0) 0 = 0 Subtitute 8 for x: x2 = 8x (8)2 = 8(8) 64 = 64 Note that both results are true statements, guaranteeing that both x = 0 and x = 8 are solutions of x2 = 8x.Answer: 0, −5 ! 6.2. SOLVING NONLINEAR EQUATIONS 403 Warning! The following is incorrect! Consider what would happen if we divided both sides of the equation x2 = 8x in Example 5 by x: x2 = 8x x2 x = 8x x x = 8 Note that we have lost the second answer found in Example 5, x = 0. This example demonstrates that you should never divide by the variable you are solving for! If you do, and cancellation occurs, you will lose answers. Let’s try solving a nonlinear equation that requires factoring by grouping. You Try It! EXAMPLE 6. Solve for x: 6x2 + 9x− 8x− 12 = 0 Solve for x: 5x2 − 20x− 4x+ 16 = 0Solution: Because we are solving for x and there is a power of x larger than one, this equation is nonlinear. Hence, the first step is to move everything to one side of the equation, making one side equal to zero. Well that’s already done, so let’s factor the left-hand side by grouping. Note that we can factor 3x out of the first two terms and −4 out of the second two terms. 6x2 + 9x− 8x− 12 = 0 3x (2x+ 3)− 4 (2x+ 3) = 0 Factor out the common factor 2x+ 3. (3x− 4)(2x+ 3) = 0 We now have a product of two factors that equals zero. Use the zero product property to write: 3x− 4 = 0 or 2x+ 3 = 0 3x = 4 2x = −3 x = 4 3 x = −3 2 Hence, the solutions are x = 4/3 and x = −3/2. Check. Let’s use the graphing calculator to check the solution x = 4/3. First, store the solution 4/3 in the variable X using the following keystrokes (see the first image in Figure 6.1. 404 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING 4 ÷ 3 STO! X,T,θ,n ENTER Next, enter the left-hand side of the equation 6x2 +9x− 8x− 12 = 0 using the following keystrokes. Note that the result in the second image in Figure 6.1 indicates that the expression 6x2 + 9x− 8x− 12 equals zero when x = 4/3. 6 × X,T,θ,n ∧ 2 + 9 × X,T,θ,n − 8 × X,T,θ,n − 1 2 ENTER Figure 6.1: Checking the solution x = 4/3. Therefore, the solution x = 4/3 checks. Readers are encouraged to use their graphing calculators to check the second solution, x = −3/2.Answer: 4/5, 4 !  || Using the Graphing Calculator In this section we will employ two different calculator routines to find the solution of a nonlinear equation. Before picking up the calculator, let’s first use an algebraic method to solve the equation x2 = −5x. The equation is nonlinear, so the first step is to move everything to one side of the equation, making one side equal to zero. x2 = −5x Nonlinear. Make one side zero. x2 + 5x = 0 Add 5x to both sides. x(x+ 5) = 0 Factor out the GCF. Use the zero product property, setting each factor equal to zero, then solving the resulting equations for x. x = 0 or x+ 5 = 0 x = −5 Hence, the solutions are x = 0 and x = −5. 6.2. SOLVING NONLINEAR EQUATIONS 405 We’ll now use the calculator to find the solutions of x2 = −5x. The first technique employs the 5:intersect routine on the calculator’s CALC menu. You Try It! EXAMPLE 7. Use the 5:intersect utility on the graphing calculator to Use the 5:intersect utility on the graphing calculator to solve the equation x2 = 4x for x. solve the equation x2 = −5x for x. Solution: Load the left-hand side of x2 = −5x in Y1 and the right-hand side in Y2 (see Figure 6.2). Selecting 6:ZStandard from the ZOOM menu produces the graphs shown in the image on the right in Figure 6.2. Figure 6.2: Sketch the graphs of each side of the equation x2 = −5x. Note that the graph of y = x2 is a parabola that opens upward, with vertex (turning point) at the origin. This graph reveals why the equation x2 = −5x is called a nonlinear equation (not all the graphs involved are lines). Next, the graph of y = −5x is a line with slope −5 and y-intercept at the origin. The two graphs obviously intersect at the origin, but it also appears that there may be another point of intersection that is off the screen. Let’s increase Ymax in an attempt to reveal the second point of intersection. After some experimentation, the settings shown in the first image in Figure 6.3 reveal both points of intersection. Pushing the GRAPH button produces the image on the right in Figure 6.3. Figure 6.3: Adjust the WINDOW parameters to reveal both points of inter- section. To find the solutions of the equation x2 = −5x, we must find the coordinates of the points where the graphs of y = x2 and y = −5x intersect. The x- coordinate of each point of intersection will be a solution of the equation x2 = −5x. 406 CHAPTER 6. FACTORING • Start by selecting 5:intersect from the CALC menu.

Hence, the solutions of x2 = −5x are x = −5 and x = 0. Note now these match the solutions found using the algebraic technique. Answer: ! Before demonstrating a second graphing calculator technique for solving nonlinear equations, let’s take a moment to recall the definition of a zero of a function, which was first presented in Chapter 5, Section 3. Zeros and x-intercepts. The points where the graph of f crosses the x-axis are called the x-intercepts of the graph of f . The x-value of each x-intercept is called a zero of the function f . 6.2.

Use the 2:zero utility on the graphing calculator to solve Use the 2:zero utility on the graphing calculator to solve the equation x2 = 4x for x. the equation x2 = −5x for x. Solution: First, make one side of the equation equal to zero. x2 = −5x Make one side zero. x2 + 5x = 0 Add 5x to both sides. To determine the values of x that make x2 +5x = 0, we must locate the points where the graph of f(x) = x2 + 5x crosses the x-axis. These points are the x-intercepts of the graph of f and the x-values of these points are the zeros of the function f . Load the function f(x) = x2 + 5x in Y1, then select 6:ZStandard to It’s often easier to find the so- lutions of a nonlinear equa- tion by making one side zero and identifying where the graph of the resulting func- tion crosses the x-axis. produce the image in Figure 6.6.

Figure 6.7: Setting the left and right bounds when using the 2:zero utility to find the x-intercepts of the graph of f(x) = x2 + 5x. • The calculator responds by asking for a “Guess?” Note the two triangular marks near the top of the viewing window in the first image in Figure 6.8 that mark the left- and right-bounds. As long as you place the cursor so that the x-value of the cursor location lies between these two marks, you’ve made a valid guess. Because the cursor already lies between these two marks, we usually leave it where it is and press the ENTER key. Figure 6.8: Setting the right bound and making a guess. After making your guess and pressing the ENTER key, the calculator pro- ceeds to find an approximation of the x-intercept that lies between the left- and right-bounds previously marked (see the second image in Figure 6.8). Hence, this x-intercept is (−5, 0), making −5 a zero of f(x) = x2 + 5x and a solution of the equation x2 + 5x = 0.
