 || Addition Suppose we have two collections of objects that we combine together to form a third collection. For example, We are combining a collection of four objects with a collection of three objects to obtain a collection of seven objects. Addition The process of combining two or more objects (real or intuitive) to form a third, the total, is called addition. In addition, the numbers being added are called addends or terms, and the total is called the sum. The plus symbol (+) is used to indicate addition, and the equal symbol (=) is used to represent the word "equal." For example, 4 + 3 = 7 means "four added to three equals seven."  || Addition Visualized on the Number Line Addition is easily visualized on the number line. Let's visualize the addition of 4 and 3 using the number line. To find 4 + 3, Start at 0. Move to the right 4 units. We are now located at 4. From 4, move to the right 3 units. We are now located at 7. Thus, 4 + 3 = 7.  || The Addition Process We'll study the process of addition by considering the sum of 25 and 43. We write this as 68. We can suggest the following procedure for adding whole numbers using this example. Example 1.20. The Process of Adding Whole Numbers To add whole numbers, The process: Write the numbers vertically, placing corresponding positions in the same column. Add the digits in each column. Start at the right (in the ones position) and move to the left, placing the sum at the bottom. Caution Confusion and incorrect sums can occur when the numbers are not aligned in columns properly. Avoid writing such additions as Sample Set A Example 1.21.  Add 276 and 103. Example 1.22.  Add 1459 and 130 In each of these examples, each individual sum does not exceed 9. We will examine individual sums that exceed 9 in the next section. Practice Set A Perform each addition. Show the expanded form in problems 1 and 2. Exercise 1.5.1. (Go to Solution) Add 63 and 25. Exercise 1.5.2. (Go to Solution) Add 4,026 and 1,501. Exercise 1.5.3. (Go to Solution) Add 231,045 and 36,121.  || Addition Involving Carrying It often happens in addition that the sum of the digits in a column will exceed 9. This happens when we add 18 and 34. We show this in expanded form as follows. Notice that when we add the 8 ones to the 4 ones we get 12 ones. We then convert the 12 ones to 1 ten and 2 ones. In vertical addition, we show this conversion by carrying the ten to the tens column. We write a 1 at the top of the tens column to indicate the carry. This same example is shown in a shorter form as follows: 8 + 4 = 12 Write 2, carry 1 ten to the top of the next column to the left. Sample Set B Perform the following additions. Use the process of carrying when needed. Example 1.23.  Add 1875 and 358. The sum is 2233. Example 1.24.  Add 89,208 and 4,946. The sum is 94,154. Example 1.25.  Add 38 and 95. As you proceed with the addition, it is a good idea to keep in mind what is actually happening. The sum is 133. Example 1.26.  Find the sum 2648, 1359, and 861. The sum is 4,868. Numbers other than 1 can be carried as illustrated in Example 1.27. Example 1.27.  Find the sum of the following numbers. The sum is 983,689. Example 1.28.  The number of students enrolled at Riemann College in the years 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987 was 10,406, 9,289, 10,108, and 11,412, respectively. What was the total number of students en­rolled at Riemann College in the years 1985, 1986, and 1987? We can determine the total number of students enrolled by adding 9,289, 10,108, and 11,412, the number of students enrolled in the years 1985, 1986, and 1987. The total number of students enrolled at Riemann College in the years 1985, 1986, and 1987 was 30,809. Practice Set B Perform each addition. For the next three problems, show the expanded form. Exercise 1.5.4. (Go to Solution) Add 58 and 29. Exercise 1.5.5. (Go to Solution) Add 476 and 85. Exercise 1.5.6. (Go to Solution) Add 27 and 88. Exercise 1.5.7. (Go to Solution) Add 67,898 and 85,627. For the next three problems, find the sums. Exercise 1.5.8. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.5.9. (Go to Solution) Exercise 1.5.10. (Go to Solution)  || Calculators Calculators provide a very simple and quick way to find sums of whole numbers. For the two problems in Sample Set C, assume the use of a calculator that does not require the use of an ENTER key (such as many Hewlett-Packard calculators). Sample Set C Use a calculator to find each sum. Example 1.29.  Table 1.36. 34 + 21 Display Reads Type 34 34 Press + 34 Type 21 21 Press = 55 The sum is 55. Example 1.30.  Table 1.37. 106 + 85 + 322 + 406 Display Reads   Type 106 106 The calculator keeps a running subtotal Press + 106   Type 85 85   Press = 191 ← 106 + 85 Type 322 322   Press + 513 ← 191 + 322 Type 406 406   Press = 919 ← 513 + 406 The sum is 919. Practice Set C Use a calculator to find the following sums. Exercise 1.5.11. (Go to Solution) 62 + 81 + 12 Exercise 1.5.12. (Go to Solution) 9,261 + 8,543 + 884 + 1,062 Exercise 1.5.13. (Go to Solution) 10,221 + 9,016 + 11,445  ||
