Mapping Diagrams A mapping diagram is a useful construction that helps one to analyze a relation. Consider the earlier relation R = {(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6)}, which had domain D = {0, 1, 2} and range R = {3, 4, 5, 6}. To construct a mapping diagram for R, list the elements in the domain of R on the left, list the elements of the range of R on the right, then use arrows to indicate the ordered pairs (see Figure 5.2). R 0 3 1 4 2 5 6 Figure 5.2: Using a mapping diagram to describe the relation R. Note how the ordred pair (0, 3) is indicated by drawing an arrow connecting 0 on the left to 3 on the right. We say that the relation “maps 0 to 3” and write R : 0 → 3. In similar fashion: • The ordered pair (0, 4) is indicated by drawing an arrow connecting 0 on the left to 4 on the right; i.e., R “maps 0 to 4” or R : 0 → 4. • The ordered pair (1, 5) is indicated by drawing an arrow connecting 1 on the left to 5 on the right; i.e., R “maps 1 to 5” or R : 1 → 5. • The ordered pair (2, 6) is indicated by drawing an arrow connecting 2 on the left to 6 on the right; i.e., R “maps 2 to 6” or R : 2 → 6.
