Difference of Squares A binomial is a polynomial with two terms. We begin with our first special binomial called difference of squares a 2 − b 2 = ( a + b ) ( a − b ) , where a and b represent algebraic expressions. : To verify the above formula, multiply: We use this formula to factor certain special binomials.   Example 1: Factor: x 2 − 16 . Solution: Step 1: Identify the binomial as difference of squares and determine the square factors of each term. Here we can write The terms are squares of x and 4. Hence a = x and b = 4 . Step 2: Substitute into the difference of squares formula. Step 3: Multiply to check. This step is optional. Answer: ( x + 4 ) ( x − 4 )   It is worth taking some extra time at this point to review all of the squares of integers from 1 to 12. Recognizing these perfect square integers helps speed the factoring process.   Example 2: Factor: 9 x 2 − 121 . Solution: The subtraction indicates that this is a difference. Furthermore, we recognize that the terms are squares. In this case, a = 3 x and b = 11 . Substitute into the formula for difference of squares. Answer: ( 3 x + 11 ) ( 3 x − 11 )   It may be the case that the terms of the binomial have a common factor. If so, it will be difficult to identify the perfect squares until we first factor out the GCF.   Example 3: Factor: 12 y 2 − 75 . Solution: The terms are not perfect squares. However, notice that they do have a common factor. First, factor out the GCF, 3. The resulting binomial factor is a difference of squares with a = 2 y and b = 5 . Answer: 3 ( 2 y + 5 ) ( 2 y − 5 )   Example 4: Factor: 49 x 2 − 100 y 2 . Solution: Here we have a binomial with two variables and recognize that it is a difference of squares. Therefore, a = 7 x and b = 10 y . Substitute into the formula for difference of squares. Answer: ( 7 x + 10 y ) ( 7 x − 10 y )   Try this! Factor: 36 x 2 − 1 . Answer: ( 6 x + 1 ) ( 6 x − 1 ) Video Solution Given any real number b, a polynomial of the form x 2 + b 2 is prime. Furthermore, the sum of squares a 2 + b 2 does not have a general factored equivalent. a 2 + b 2 does not have a general factored equivalent. Care should be taken not to confuse this with a perfect square trinomial: Therefore, When the degree of the special binomial is greater than two, we may need to apply the difference of squares formula multiple times. A polynomial is completely factored when none of the factors can be factored any further.   Example 5: Factor completely: x 4 − 16 . Solution: First, identify what is being squared: To do this, recall the power rule for exponents, ( x m ) n = x m n . When exponents are raised to a power, multiply them. With this in mind, determine that ( x 2 ) 2 = x 4 and write Therefore, a = x 2 and b = 4 . Substitute into the formula for difference of squares. At this point, notice that the factor ( x 2 − 4 ) is itself a difference of two squares and thus can be further factored using a = x and b = 2 . The factor ( x 2 + 4 ) is a sum of squares, which cannot be factored using real numbers. Answer: ( x 2 + 4 ) ( x + 2 ) ( x − 2 )   Try this! Factor completely: 81 x 4 − 1 .
