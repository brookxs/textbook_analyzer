 || Solving Applied Problems Let’s study some interesting problems that involve linear equations in one variable. In order to solve such problems, we apply the following five-step method: Five-Step Method for Solving Word Problems Let x (or some other letter) represent the unknown quantity. Translate the words to mathematical symbols and form an equation. Solve this equation. Ask yourself "Does this result seem reasonable?" Check the solution by substituting the result into the original statement of the problem. If the answer doesn’t check, you have either solved the equation incorrectly, or you have developed the wrong equation. Check your method of solution first. If the result does not check, reconsider your equation. Write the conclusion. If it has been your experience that word problems are difficult, then follow the five-step method carefully. Most people have difficulty because they neglect step 1. Always start by INTRODUCING A VARIABLE! Keep in mind what the variable is representing throughout the problem.  ||
