Simplifying Expressions When Solving Equations Sometimes we need to simplify expressions before we can isolate terms contain- ing x. You Try It! EXAMPLE 5. Solve for x: 2(3x+ 1)− 3(4− 2x) = −34Solve for x: 2x− (x− 2) = 2(x+ 7) Solution: We’ll first simplify the expression on the left-hand side of the equation using the Rules Guiding Order of Operations. 2(3x+ 1)− 3(4− 2x) = −34 Original equation. 6x+ 2− 12 + 6x = −34 Multiply: 2(3x+ 1) = 6x+ 2. Multiply: −3(4− 2x) = −12 + 6x. 12x− 10 = −34 Add: 6x+ 6x = 12x. Add: 2− 12 = −10. To “undo” subtracting 10, we add 10 to both sides of the equation. 12x− 10 + 10 = −34 + 10 Add 10 to both sides. 12x = −24 Simplify both sides. To “undo” multiplying by 12, we divide both sides by 12. 12x 12 = −24 12 Divide both sides by 12. x = −2 Simplify both sides. Check: Let’s use the TI-84 to check this solution. 2.2.

Figure 2.7: Checking the solution to 2(3x+ 1)− 3(4− 2x) = −34. Note that when −2 is substituted for x in the left-hand of the equation, the result is −34, equalling the right-hand side of the equation. Thus, the solution −2 checks. Answer: x = −12 ! You Try It! EXAMPLE 6.

On the right, distribute the 4. 12x− 15 = 4x− 4 On the left, add: 2x+ 10x = 12x 94 CHAPTER 2. SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES Next, we need to isolate terms containing the variable x on one side of the equation. To remove the term 4x from the right-hand side, we subtract 4x from both sides of the equation. 12x− 15− 4x = 4x− 4− 4x Subtract 4x from both sides. 8x− 15 = −4 Simplify both sides. To remove the term −15 from the left-hand side, we add 15 to both sides of the equation. 8x− 15 + 15 = −4 + 15 Add 15 to both sides. 8x = 11 Simplify both sides. Finally, to “undo” multiplying by 8, we divide both sides by 8. 8x 8 = 11 8 Divide both sides by 8. x = 11 8 Simplify both sides. Check: Let’s use the TI-84 to check this solution. 1.

The fact that both sides of the equation evaluate to an identical 1.5 when x = 11/8 guarantees that 11/8 is a solution of 2x− 5(3− 2x) = 4(x− 1). Answer: x = −1/3 ! 96 CHAPTER 2.
