Dividing Decimals By Powers of 10 In problems 4 and 5 of the section called “Practice Set B”, we found the decimal representations of 8,162.41÷10 and 8,162.41÷100. Let's look at each of these again and then, from these observations, make a general statement regarding division of a decimal num­ber by a power of 10. Thus, 8,162.41÷10 = 816.241. Notice that the divisor 10 is composed of one 0 and that the quotient 816.241 can be obtained from the dividend 8,162.41 by moving the decimal point one place to the left. Thus, 8,162.41÷100 = 81.6241. Notice that the divisor 100 is composed of two 0's and that the quotient 81.6241 can be obtained from the dividend by moving the decimal point two places to the left. Using these observations, we can suggest the following method for dividing decimal numbers by powers of 10. Dividing a Decimal Fraction by a Power of 10 To divide a decimal fraction by a power of 10, move the decimal point of the decimal fraction to the left as many places as there are zeros in the power of 10. Add zeros if necessary. Sample Set D Find each quotient. Example 6.52.  9,248.6÷100 Since there are 2 zeros in this power of 10, we move the decimal point 2 places to the left. Example 6.53.  3.28÷10,000 Since there are 4 zeros in this power of 10, we move the decimal point 4 places to the left. To do so, we need to add three zeros.
