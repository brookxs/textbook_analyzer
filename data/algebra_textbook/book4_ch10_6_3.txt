The Process of Subtraction From this definition, we suggest the following rule for subtracting signed numbers. Subtraction of Signed Numbers To perform the subtraction a – b , add the opposite of b to a , that is, change the sign of b and add. Sample Set A Perform the indicated subtractions. Example 10.26.  5 − 3 = 5 + ( − 3) = 2 Example 10.27.  4 – 9 = 4 + ( – 9) = – 5 Example 10.28.  − 4 − 6 = − 4 + ( − 6) = − 10 Example 10.29.  − 3 − ( − 12) = − 3 + 12 = 9 Example 10.30.  0 – ( – 15) = 0 + 15 = 15 Example 10.31.  The high temperature today in Lake Tahoe was 26°F. The low temperature tonight is expected to be -7°F. How many degrees is the temperature expected to drop? We need to find the difference between 26 and -7. 26 – ( – 7 ) = 26 + 7 = 33 Thus, the expected temperature drop is 33°F. Example 10.32.  Practice Set A Perform the indicated subtractions.
