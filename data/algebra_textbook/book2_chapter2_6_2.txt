Solving Proportions Cross multiply to solve proportions where terms are unknown.   Example 4: Solve: 5 8 = n 4 . Solution: Cross multiply and then solve for n. Answer: n = 5 2   Example 5: Solve: 15 x = 5 6 . Solution: Cross multiply then solve for x. Answer: x = 18   Example 6: Solve: n + 3 5 = 7 2 . Solution: When cross multiplying, be sure to group n + 3 . Apply the distributive property in the next step. Answer: n = 29 2   Try this! Solve: 5 3 = 3 n − 1 2 . Answer: n = 13 9 Video Solution Solving Proportions Cross multiply to solve proportions where terms are unknown.   Example 4: Solve: 5 8 = n 4 . Solution: Cross multiply and then solve for n.
