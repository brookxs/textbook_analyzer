Ratios and Percents Ratio, Percent We defined a ratio as a comparison, by division, of two pure numbers or two like denominate numbers. A most convenient number to compare numbers to is 100. Ratios in which one number is compared to 100 are called percents. The word percent comes from the Latin word "per centum." The word "per" means "for each" or "for every," and the word "centum" means "hundred." Thus, we have the following definition. Percent means “for each hundred," or "for every hundred." The symbol % is used to represent the word percent. Sample Set A Example 7.22.  The ratio 26 to 100 can be written as 26%. We read 26% as "twenty-six percent." Example 7.23.  The ratio can be written as 165%. We read 165% as "one hundred sixty-five percent." Example 7.24.  The percent 38% can be written as the fraction . Example 7.25.  The percent 210% can be written as the fraction or the mixed number or 2.1. Example 7.26.  Since one dollar is 100 cents, 25 cents is of a dollar. This implies that 25 cents is 25% of one dollar. Practice Set A Exercise 7.5.1. (Go to Solution) Write the ratio 16 to 100 as a percent. Exercise 7.5.2. (Go to Solution) Write the ratio 195 to 100 as a percent. Exercise 7.5.3. (Go to Solution) Write the percent 83% as a ratio in fractional form. Exercise 7.5.4. (Go to Solution) Write the percent 362% as a ratio in fractional form.
