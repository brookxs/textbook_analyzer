Common Multiples There will be times when we are given two or more whole numbers and we will need to know if there are any multiples that are common to each of them. If there are, we will need to know what they are. For example, some of the multiples that are common to 2 and 3 are 6, 12, and 18. Sample Set B Example 3.35.  We can visualize common multiples using the number line. Notice that the common multiples can be divided by both whole numbers. Practice Set B Find the first five common multiples of the following numbers. Exercise 3.6.6. (Go to Solution) 2 and 4 Exercise 3.6.7. (Go to Solution) 3 and 4 Exercise 3.6.8.
